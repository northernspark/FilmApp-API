9
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,904
I'm honored.

10
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,339
Pleasure's all mine.

11
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,441
Tell me where the bomb is.

12
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,143
10 seconds, or you're dead.

13
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:25,379
Interesting.

14
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:29,217
You see, when my men
and I hid it...

15
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,619
I made sure to erase
any witnesses.

16
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,624
And then I erased the erasers.

17
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,228
Which means,

18
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:41,541
I'm now the only one
who knows...

19
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:44,365
just where that
dangerously compact

20
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,867
and transportable nuke is.

21
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:48,701
So...

22
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:55,543
I'd say I have
more than 10 seconds.

23
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:58,145
Well then, in that case,
I'd say you'd better start...

24
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:06,186
Oh, fuck!

25
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,223
Oh, my God! Why did you do that?

26
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:10,424
I didn't do it on purpose.

27
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,193
There's like a ton
of pollen in here!

28
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:14,795
Oh, God! Christmas on a cracker!

29
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,196
Did you take your medicine?

30
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,331
I forgot it on the plane.

31
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:18,699
I told you this morning,

32
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,634
I put extra in all your jackets!

33
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:22,002
You did?

34
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,604
Great. Shit! Thanks.

35
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,573
No, you know what? That's on me.

36
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,375
Because I heard you
sniffle a while ago

37
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:30,077
and I did nothing
with that information.

38
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,345
So that's blood
on my hands, really...

39
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,180
Okay. You know what?
You got three coming in.

40
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,815
Get out the back door now. Move.

41
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,757
Anybody in here?

42
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,993
Yeah, we got one coming
around the corner, now.

43
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:49,730
Your three guests are coming out

44
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:50,964
that door behind you right now.

45
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:51,998
Watch your six.

46
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,737
Yahtzee.

47
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,539
Oh, zinger!

48
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,873
I should've brought
more bullets.

49
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,376
I thought they were
chocolate sprinkles,

50
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,077
which I would eat,
normally, by the fistful...

51
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:05,513
but this tasted like...

52
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,281
There's no other way
to say it, really.

53
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:09,116
Like a rat's arse.

54
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,452
Guys, can you please
keep it down?

55
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,454
Unfortunately, there's
vermin in the ceiling again,

56
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,088
and I hate to say it, but...

57
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,425
they've pooped
all over your cake.

58
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,159
- I'm going left?
- No.

59
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,562
I need you to go right
and head down the tunnel.

60
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,230
You've got one coming
around to your right,

61
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,298
and he's got a swarm behind him.

62
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:25,733
That's my girl.

63
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,766
Oh, I don't know.

64
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,284
Watch your back.

65
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,188
Oh, that was a close one, Fine.

66
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,723

You are.

Nice moves, Fine.

72
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:02,875
Pilates has been
working out for you.

73
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,271
You noticed?

74
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,074
Yeah, you just seem looser.
Like, in your hips.

75
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,543
I mean athletically speaking.

76
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:11,412
I don't know. I guess
you don't seem so awkward.

77
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:12,546
Shut up!

78
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,014
Going straight? No.

79
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,716
Go right up the stairs.

80
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:16,917
You're gonna find
a little friend

00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,662
You're clear to the top.

84
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:29,696
Get moving.

85
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,300
Oh, my God! The rats can fly!

86
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,502
Come on, you guys!

87
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:37,538
All right, Fine.
Stop at the door.

88
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,407
You got a guard approaching.
I'll tell you when.

89
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,442
Wait for it, Fine. Three...

90
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,044
Two, one. Now!

91
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,416
Oh, dear, did I forget to knock?

92
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:57,425
They're clawing at my hair!
I can't see!

93
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,959
What do you mean,
you can't see me?

94
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,429
I'm good. You've got
SUVs approaching.

95
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,031
Go to the dock!

96
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,099
Dock. Excellent idea.

97
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,601
Boyanov's boat is at the end.

98
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,823
Uh... No keys, Coop.

99
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,358
The panel's on the lower left
under the steering wheel.

100
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,893
You can hotwire it.

101
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,063
I can't get to the wires!

102
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,833
Okay, then stay down
and hold your ears!

103
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:41,502
How will I hear
your beautiful voice?

104
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:42,970
Stop being adorable
and get down!

105
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,341
Lock on coordinates 43.16547...

106
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,645
27.94654... and fire, now.

107
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:07,928
Whoo!

108
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,631
Close one!

109
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,500
Nice drone work, Coop!

110
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:13,701
I could kiss you.

111
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,102
Oh!

112
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:19,039
Well, I would accept that
with an open mouth.

113
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,475
Soon as I'm back,
dinner is on me.

114
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,544
Great work, Coop.

115
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,417
Hey, pick up my dry cleaning
for me, would you?

116
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,080
Also, get my car.

117
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,616
Oh, sure. No problem.

118
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,250
Oh, and I have to fire
my gardener.

119
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,552
He keeps running over

120
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:32,820
the sprinkler heads
with the mower.

121
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,254
Can you cut him loose for me?

122
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,124
Um... Yeah. Oh, yeah, sure.

123
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,792
You kidding? I'd love it!

124
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,961
You're the best.

125
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,229
Smell you later, pal.

126
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,865
God. Poor Jaime.

127
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:51,772
The thing is, Jaime, that...
Uh... Oh!

128
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,607
These are your children?

129
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:54,675

130
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,943
Yeah, I have children.

131
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,145
I just have to cover those eyes.

132
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,481
They're looking
right at me. Um...

133
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,250
Please, don't fire me.

134
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,585
No. Jaime, I would never.

135
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,820
This is more of a review.

136
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:09,923
Oh.

137
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,258
Jaime.

138
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,561

Coop. You're eating
a hand towel.

158
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,651
Just cleansing my palette.

159

Jeez. You had to take me
to such a dump?

160
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:56,456
Come on, cheapskate!

161
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,529
Burger King was booked up.

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,096
Sorry. I'm having dinner

165
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,901
You could. You're funny.
Your timing is perfect.

Never as funny as you,

00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,343
Go team.

169
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,046
Hey, I've been thinking.

170
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,848
Yeah.

171
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,250
I couldn't do
what I do without you.

172
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,718
And I've been thinking

173
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,653
about doing something
special for you...

174
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,755
So...

175
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,291
Good gravy, Fine.

176
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,232
Oh. That's... It's
a crazy cupcake!

177
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,669
You love cakes. Well...

178
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,304
I'm not a big cake...

179
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,706
I make cakes. Yes. I
see the connection.

180
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,475
Now you can wear a cake.

181
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,711
How did you know I don't care
for traditional jewelry?

182
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:54,882
I can't seem to
stop looking at it...

183
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,617
and it can't stop looking at me.

184
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,019
Imagine how awkward
it would've been

185
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,921
if it'd been a diamond ring
or something.

186
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:05,058
Ooh... Not a diamond ring! No!

187
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:07,260
I would've had to say,
"I don't want to marry you!"

188
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:10,030
I don't want
your muscly arms and hands...

189
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:14,601
rubbing my back with Nivea
for the rest of my life.

190
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:17,037
And our three kids run in,
you know...

191
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,906
Karen, Tommy and Billy...

192
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:20,440
and we'd say, "Get out of here!"

193
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,010
And they'd just all
have that beautiful jaw...

194
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:25,612
and sky-blue eyes, and a full mouth.
I mean...

195
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,180
no, thank you.

196
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,382
I'll just, you know,
I'll just...

197
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,885
Can you give me a little
jewelry I can actually wear?

198
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,086
Not gonna wear it?

199
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,390
Yes. Yeah. I was just saving it.

200
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,892
Put it on!

201
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,427
Look at that. Wow, that's a...

202
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,329
That is an adjustable toggle.
Adjustable toggle.

203
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:45,465
You don't see that
with a lot of jewelry.

204
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,000
It's so you. Is it?

205
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:48,301
Wow, perfect.

206
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,839
Oh... Somebody's jealous.

207
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:54,407
Seriously, I couldn't do
what I do without you,

208
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,876
in my earpiece.

209
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,110
I could never do what you do.

210
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,979
Can you imagine me as a spy?

211
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,481
Oh, my God.

212
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,749
Out in the field. Yeah.

213
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,651
With a gun! What?

214
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,954
"Hi, terrorists. Oh, golly!"

215
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,823
"Oh, I shot myself! Whoops!"

216
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:11,892
"I meant to shoot you, not me!"

217
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,126
That's probably what I'd say.

218
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,395
"Hey, terrorists,
you better watch out,"

219
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,130
"or I'll make you
a chocolate cake."

220
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:19,524
"Do you like chocolate? Well,
then I'll make you a vanilla."

221
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,536
They would never
let me be a spy.

222
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,705
I can't even dress like a spy.

223
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,674
Look at you and your tailored...

224
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,709
Everything is cut right.

225
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,412
And mine is like a lumpy
pumpkin sack dress.

226
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:33,947
Oh, come...

227
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,515
It doesn't even have a label.
Does not have a label.

228
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,516
I think my mom made it.

229
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,051
No, stop.

230
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:39,686
I should get on my hands
and knees and start scooping.

231
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,221
Good God. Go easy on yourself.

232
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,389
Okay.

233
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,091
We're a perfect team.
That's why we work.

234
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:45,124
Yeah.

235
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,326
Come here.

236
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:49,997
Come here. Close.

237
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,567
I think you're getting pinkeye.

238
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,236
What? No.

239
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,837
Right there. No, that's not...

240
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:00,007
Did you wipe your eye after
you cleaned out the cat box?

241
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
I don't have cats.

242
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,742
Why did I think that?

243
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,044
I don't know.

244
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:06,013
You should get some.
They're good company.

245
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,721
We've intercepted chatter...

246
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,656
that the weapon is still being
offered to the highest bidder.

247
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,159
Someone other than Boyanov
knows where that nuke is.

248
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,928
It's probably
his daughter, Rayna.

249
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:23,130
She's really the only
person he's trusted.

250
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,797
Jesus, Cooper,
do you have pinkeye?

251
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,499
Go home. You're going
to infect everybody.

252
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,135
Told you.

253
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:30,270
No, it's not pinkeye, ma'am.

254
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:33,173
It's just I'm having a bit
of an allergic reaction.

255
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,741
Well, I'm allergic to disgusting

256
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,776
childhood illnesses,
so stay away from me.

257
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,711
Sorry. Anyway, you're right.

258
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,213
After Boyanov's death,

259
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:43,416
Rayna went to a safety deposit
box at a DSK bank in Varna.

260
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,717
The chatter picked up
later that night.

261
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:45,752
What do we know about her?

262
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:46,785
I can pull up her file.

263
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,689
Oh, that's stuck.

264
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,224
It's just a little warm in here.

265
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,761
Pull up my file...
Jesus! Not my keyboard

266
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,896
with your pinkeye-infected
fingers!

267
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,165
Why don't you just cry directly

268
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,899
into my mouth
while you're at it?

269
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,868
It really is just
an allergic reaction...

270
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,736
Sit down. I'll do it.

271
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,905
- Okay, I'm gonna go sit down.
- Rayna Boyanov.

272
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,474
Majored in international law
at Oxford.

273
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,908
Top of her class.

274
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,877
Been living in London
for the past 10 years.

275
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,645
We know she has been
communicating

276
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,881
with the heads of several
terrorist organizations.

277
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,416
Most ominously...

278
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,718
Solsa Dudaev,
the al-Qaeda-funded leader

279
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,487
of the Chechen Martyrs' Brigade.

280
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,789
We have compelling evidence that
he has the machinery in place

281
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,057
to get that nuke
to New York in time

282
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,558
for next week's
UN General Assembly.

283
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,793
I'm already packed.

284
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,095
One of our sources was told

285
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,662
she has taken up residence
outside of Sofia.

286
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:30,696
Go get her.

287
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:33,700
Grab my things, Coop.

288
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,438
Jesus, Cooper, go put on
some sunglasses or something.

289
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,673
I feel like you're a Gypsy,
cursing me with it.

290
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,142
Yep, I'm on it.

291
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,610
Yeah, that's all good. Oh, Fine?

292
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,646
Hi. Hey, Super Cooper.

293
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,648
Oh! Um...

294
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:53,086
I just was feeling
a little weird about...

295
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,488
Oh, yeah? ...Some of the stuff,
and I think the intel...

296
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:59,126
on Rayna's location
seems a little too easy.

297
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,694
I just...
Something doesn't feel right.

298
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,396
It'll be right when
we get Rayna behind bars

299
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,365
and that nuke back in our hands.

300
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,602
Yeah, sure. I just...

301
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,639
I don't know. All my alarm bells
are going off with this one.

302
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:17,677
Really? Well, then, it's
okay 'cause I have a plan.

303
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,580
You and I gotta stop going
on these awful missions.

304
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,015
Run off together.

305
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,316
Do you mean that?

306
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,819
What?

307
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:30,590
Do I mean that?
You got me. You kidder.

308
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:32,459
You sucker! No.

309
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,395
You should have seen your face!
You were like...

310
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:44,037
Fine, I'm sorry if I...

311
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:47,006
Don't be. God, I admire you.

312
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,843
"I admire you"?

313
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,680
Well, did he at least say it
in a flirty tone that says...

314
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:57,650
"And because of my admiration, I
shall now take my shirt off...

315
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,886
"and penetrate ye"? No.

316
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,221
The only way he'd
invite me to his bedroom

317
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:02,755
is if he wants me
to fix his bed.

318
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,424
I'm so stupid.

319
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,177
Can I just have a sip of your wine?
Mmm-hmm.

320
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:07,593
It's quite buttery.

321
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,963
Wow. Okay, we could
order you your own glass.

322
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,599
That was mine!

323
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,467
My life is a disaster.

324
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:15,668
No, it's not.

325
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,570
I'm 40, I live by myself...

326
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:19,206
I haven't been
in a real relationship

327
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,208
since Jerry left me
three years ago.

328
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,009
Well, Jerry was a jackass.

329
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,911
When I gave up teaching
to join the CIA,

330
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:26,279
I thought everything
was gonna be different.

331
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:28,248
I thought I was gonna be
this amazing spy.

332
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,083
I'm just the same boring
person I was before.

333
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:31,351
Well, for what it's worth,

334
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,985
I think you're brilliant
as you are.

335
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,188
You're exciting. Come
on, let's cheer you up.

336
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,524
Okay. My nephew
loves this. All right.

337
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,661
Okay. Thanks.
Isn't your nephew three?

338
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,664
My God. That's the same face.

339
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:46,065
Okay, this will be different.
Exactly the same face.

340
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,534
This will be different.

341
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:51,371
Ready? Aah...

342
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,840
That's the exact same thing.

343
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:54,913
How is that the same thing?

344
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,109
There was a little bit
of tongue there.

345
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:57,710
Please stop.
That's not cheering me up.

346
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,079
Do you know what? I'm glad
you said that to Fine.

347
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,849
I am, because you
play it too safe.

348
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:06,085
I still hear my mom's voice...

349
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:09,322
"Well-behaved women
often make history."

350
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:10,490
Yes, you do know
the phrase is...

351
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:13,460
"Well-behaved women
seldom make history"?

352
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,027
Yeah. That's never
how she said it.

353
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,096
What were her others?

354
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,166
"Just blend in."
"Let somebody else win."

355
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,100
Classic. I got that a
lot in high school.

356
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:23,603
And there was, "Give up
on your dream, Susan."

357
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,238
She used to write that
in my lunchbox.

358
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:28,475
Oh... I mean, look, okay?

359
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,744
What's really so
different between us

360
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,180
and Karen Walker?

361
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,948
I think literally everything.

362
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,083
No, hang on, no,
because you were

363
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,685
just as good as her
at the Academy.

364
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:41,288
She's had more successful
missions than even Fine.

365
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:42,422
Oh, she's the worst.

366
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:46,359
Look at her. She thinks she's
so perfect, doesn't she?

367
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:49,996
"Hi, I'm Karen Walker,
super spy."

368
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,165
Perfect hair. Perfect face.

369
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,733
She probably cries herself
to sleep every night.

370
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,668
I don't think she probably does.
She probably does.

371
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:58,538
And not, like,
sort of cute, little tears.

372
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,608
Like, really sort of
silent, kind of big.

373
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,544
I don't think that's what...

374
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,546
Like a sort of upside
down kidney bean.

375
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:09,081
"This is what I look like
when I'm asleep."

376
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,750
Shut up, be quiet.

377
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,823
She won't know who we are.
She's so full of herself.

378
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,954
Hi. Hey, Nancy. Hi, Susan.

379
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:15,987
Hi!

380
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:20,327
Look at you two cuties
sitting here being all cute.

381
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,628
Aw!

382
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,297
Oh, you.

383
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,865
Can I have
an Old Fashioned, please?

384
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,700
The service is really slow.

385
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:30,270
Super slow. Good luck getting
that in the next hour.

386
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:31,738
Here you go, Miss Walker.
Thank you.

387
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,373
Oh. Wow.

388
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,475
Alan and I go way back.
I come here all the time.

389
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,310
So do we. Right, Alan?

390
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,279
Hey, Alan. Alan!

391
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,647
Big A, Big A!

392
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,615
Whoo-hoo! Al! We got a whole...

393
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,384
Miss Walker,
are these two bothering you?

394
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,052
No, thank you. They're fine.
Okay.

395
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,153
Alan!

396
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,621
He's the sweetest.

397
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,122
He totally pretends
not to know. It's a game.

398
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,724
He's funny. Yeah.

399
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,526
Well, anyway,
I'm taking some time off,

400
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,127
so I'll see you guys
when I get back.

401
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,496
Oh. Where are you going?

402
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,699
Capri. Capri.

403
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:02,172
I believe it's "Cahpri." That's
how the locals say it, anyway.

404
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:03,836
Oh...

405
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,772
I wish I could just
stick around here...

406
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,574
curl up with a good book.

407
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:10,277
But I have a yacht full of
friends waiting for me.

408
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,178
Wow. Yachts are the worst.

409
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,414
They seem so glamorous, but...

410
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:15,548
- They're the worst.
- Boo, yachts.

411
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,884
Anyhoo, I'll see you guys
when I get back,

412
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,118
all freckled and tan.

413
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,151
We're gonna see you.

414
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:21,954
Bye. Bye!

415
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,224
Oh, sorry.

416
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,293
Susan is ill.

417
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:28,428
It's her stomach.

418
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,699
Oh, my God. Thank you for that.

419
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,166
Why would you do that?
I panicked.

420
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
What a great moment.

421
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:37,804
Just look at her.

422
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,339
I know. That dress.

423
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,173
Look at that confidence.

424
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:43,310
You're not even allowed
to smoke in here.

425
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,279
I'm gonna go home.

426
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:47,514
No, come on.

427
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:48,681
Yes.

428
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:49,716
Susan.

429
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,284
Feel better.

430
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:53,019
Thank you. Yeah.

431
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,221
Fine, you good?

432
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,290
Okay, Coop. Just pulling up.

433
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:59,292
Susan, you're killing it.

434
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:01,093
Oh, good. It's the chicory.

435
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:02,127
Yeah.

436
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,399
Any sign of her in the house?

437
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,368
Heat sensors
aren't picking anything up.

438
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,569
There's some kind
of interference.

439
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,771
I don't like this, Fine.

440
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,039
I'm up for the challenge.

441
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:14,574
Let's go in.

442
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,147
Shoot, there's something
wrong with your camera.

443
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,214
Can you switch it out
for a new one?

444
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:23,450
Too late.

445
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:33,593
No security.

446
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,529
Her father would never have
left himself this exposed.

447
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:39,466
Pull back, Fine.
This is too easy.

448
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:40,733
I like things that are easy.

449
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:50,377
Oh, my God, Fine!

450
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,944
I don't know how
you do things like that.

451
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,346
Hey.

452
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,114
Who's the finest of them all?

453
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,949
I don't know.

454
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,618
I'm guessing you?

455
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,920
Drop your weapon.

456
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,455
Fine, what's happening?

457
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:03,956
Let me guess.
Whoever is in your ear

458
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,558
wants to know what's happening?

459
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:08,695
He's about to die.

460
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:10,397
That's what.

461
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:16,503
An awfully big gun
for such a little girl.

462
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:19,606
Oh, God, don't say
stuff like that.

463
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,140
Okay, there's a knife rack
directly to your right.

464
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,810
The way she's holding the gun,
she's not experienced.

465
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,513
If you duck and lunge, you can
get the knife and disarm her.

466
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:28,866
Did someone just suggest that
you grab one of those knives?

467
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,784
No, no, no!

468
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:32,818
Damn it!

469
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,085
Fine!

470
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:36,956
Can they see me right now?

471
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:39,931
Let me adjust
the angle a little bit.

472
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,400
Oh, my God, Fine.

473
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:52,905
His name was Bradley Fine.
He worked for the CIA.

474
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,674
Other top agents include

475
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,376
Matthew Wright, Timothy Cress...

476
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,279
Rick Ford and Karen Walker.

477
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,615
Come on, Fine. Come on.

478
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:06,553
I know who all
your active agents are.

479
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:10,122
So, unless you'd like
the body count to grow...

480
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:12,692
I suggest you stay
far away from me.

481
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:15,394
Now grab some tissues,

482
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:17,664
because shit's about
to get real sad.

483
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:18,697
No, no...

484
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,604
Oh, my God, Fine.

485
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:27,774
As Deputy Director...

486
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:31,210
I have never had
a more difficult duty...

487
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:35,247
than to bid farewell
to colleagues taken from us.

488
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:38,417
From Dover,
to the family services...

489
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:40,620
to memorials like these...

490
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:41,988
it's tough to say goodbye.

491
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:44,557
There's nothing you
could have done, Susan.

492
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:48,695
Bradley Fine was more than
just a coworker and a friend.

493
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:50,563
He was part of our family.

494
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,865
And as family,
even knowing that the universe

495
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:55,802
has a plan
for each human life...

496
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:57,470
it's hard to accept
the sudden loss

497
00:23:57,504 --> 00:24:00,473
of such a good
and decent person.

498
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,612
Okay, there's a
knife rack directly to your right.

499
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:08,414
Susan, I got your assessment
report on Rayna Boyanov.

500
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,983
I know you're probably feeling
a lot of emotion right now...

501
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:14,186
but please refrain from using
the term "thundercunt."

502
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:17,490
Oh, my God. I didn't
realize I wrote that.

503
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:18,925
I'm sorry.

504
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,301
Nancy, I'm sending you a photo.

505
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:30,703
It's in pretty bad shape.

506
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:32,071
Can you enhance it? Mm-hmm.

507
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,582
Paris?

508
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:47,053
How the fuck did this twat
find out our fucking names?

509
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:48,521
We don't know.

510
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:50,823
And dial it way back
with the "T" word, Ford.

511
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:53,259
You're not immune from the
HR department. Grow up.

512
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:55,327
And "twat" means something
completely different in England.

513
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:57,063
Here it means a vagina.

514
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,666
Anyway, obviously
we're talking about a mole.

515
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,200
It could be a mole, they could
have hacked our system.

516
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,268
It's anyone's guess.

517
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:04,737
The bottom line is Rayna
Boyanov is about to sell...

518
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:06,673
a small-scale tactical
nuclear weapon

519
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:08,207
to a terrorist organization...

520
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,877
and we don't know
where she or the bomb is.

521
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,279
Fortunately, our analyst
Susan Cooper found a lead.

522
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:16,949
Rayna had the number
of Sergio De Luca...

523
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:18,685
and we've long suspected De Luca

524
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:21,621
of working as an intermediary
with terrorist groups.

525
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:23,923
Rayna may be using him
to find buyers for the nuke.

526
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:26,593
The number was to an office
he keeps in Paris.

527
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:28,427
I told you to send me in
there instead of Fine,

528
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,829
and you didn't.

529
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,598
And now Fine is dead.
I'm going the fuck in.

530
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:33,165
You can't.

531
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,101
We need someone to follow De
Luca without being detected...

532
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:37,236
and that will hopefully
take us to Rayna...

533
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,771
but it can't be any of you.

534
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:41,808
Here's what we do...

535
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:45,311
I go into the Face/Off
machine, get a whole new face.

536
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,513
I turn up,
they never know it's me.

537
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,681
Do you have quarters?
Because it costs 50 cents.

538
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,282
What, I gotta pay?

539
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:52,384
No, because it doesn't exist.

540
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:53,953
Yes, it does!

541
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:57,590
I heard Cress and Wright talking
about it in the shitter.

542
00:25:57,624 --> 00:25:59,425
I'm pretty sure
they were pulling your leg.

543
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:01,527
You pair of fucking vaginas.

544
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,796
Seriously,
you've got to cut that out.

545
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,465
Jesus. Look, one of us
has to go in.

546
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,134
Doesn't matter
if we've been exposed.

547
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:09,836
We've all gone deep before,

548
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:11,738
and we've always gotten our guy.

549
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:14,173
Guys, this is more than
just a kill mission.

550
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,809
We can get Rayna, De Luca, and
some top terrorist leadership...

551
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:19,045
and get the weapon back
if we do this right.

552
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,713
We just need someone
who can shadow them

553
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,715
without attracting attention.

554
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:23,683
We need someone invisible.

555
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:24,951
I'll do it.

556
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:27,186
Okay, thanks, lunch lady.

557
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:28,487
I'm serious.

558
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,522
I have never
been out in the field.

559
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:32,959
Exactly. Stupid fucking idea.

560
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:35,494
My point is that
it's highly doubtful

561
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,196
that I've ever been exposed.

562
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,131
But you worked with Fine.

563
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:40,232
They may have
a record of you, too.

564
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,834
Possibly.

565
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:44,704
But the odds of them
knowing my face are very low.

566
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:46,706
Miss Crocker, I would
really like to do this.

567
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,440
For Fine.

568
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,877
What are you gonna do? Bring one
of your cats as a sidekick?

569
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:53,145
I don't have any cats!

570
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:55,815
You're not seriously
considering this, are you?

571
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:58,050
Look here, Betty...

572
00:26:58,084 --> 00:26:59,752
Ford, if you call me
Betty Crocker,

573
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:01,620
I will rip your fucking
heart out of your chest.

574
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:03,656
Not only did I become a citizen

575
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,358
and take a vow
to protect this country...

576
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:10,697
I also took a vow to avenge my
fallen comrades. We all fucking did.

577
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,299
No, we didn't. Not me.

578
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:16,435
I'm pretty sure we all took a fucking vow.
I remember it.

579
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,571
I remember raising my fucking
hand and saying some shit.

580
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:21,874
If you think I'm gonna sit by

581
00:27:21,908 --> 00:27:23,548
and let you send in
a fucking secretary...

582
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,577
to do my work...

583
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:27,179
you might as well accept
my resignation now.

584
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:28,748
If I can jump in,

585
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:31,650
I am technically, uh,
classified as an agent.

586
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:35,822
Look... Full agent. So...

587
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:38,324
agent, agent, agent,
I'm an agent.

588
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,893
Are you considering this?

589
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,495
For your safety, and the safety
of those around this table...

590
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,231
I am considering it.

591
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:47,333
Then consider this, I quit.

592
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:52,138
And I know there's a fucking
Face/Off machine.

593
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,206
You're just keeping it
secret from me.

594
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:56,843
Okay.

595
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:58,516
That hasn't happened before.

596
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,814
It is quite a lovely office.

597
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:03,850
What's your deal, Cooper?

598
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:05,451
What do you mean?

599
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:07,286
You got a fiery side?

600
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:10,556
I really did, in that report,
mean to write "cunning."

601
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:11,991
I've been going over your files.

602
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,193
You were top of your class
at the Academy,

603
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:15,627
in all computer
and support skills.

604
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:16,796
No surprise there.

605
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:18,697
But you have a certain...

606
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:20,900
tame demeanor around the office,

607
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:22,534
that says you've never
even held a gun.

608
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:25,437
So imagine my surprise...

609
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:27,511
when I saw footage from
this drill back at The Farm.

610
00:28:31,978 --> 00:28:33,880
Is that... I can't even...

611
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:36,387
Is that me? I can't really...
Stupid gun!

612
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:39,251
Somebody definitely
sped this up.

613
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,888
Ooh! Camera angle
and stuff make...

614
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:45,457
Cooper, Cooper, stop!
Jesus Christ, what are you...

615
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:46,826
Ouch.

616
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,260
Out of context, that's...

617
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,430
I must have watched
this 15 times now...

618
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,099
because what the fuck?

619
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:54,934
I almost put it up on YouTube.

620
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:59,105
I was, to say the least,
uncomfortable with the event.

621
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:01,107
But I would also like to say,
it was over 10 years ago.

622
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,408
The instructor was not harmed.

623
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:04,643
Fine was your mentor, right?

624
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,112
Yes.

625
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:09,048
Why did you not
become a field agent?

626
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,549
Well, we're such a great
fit and a great team.

627
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,384
Fine made some great points.

628
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,321
Maybe I match better with,
just staying...

629
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:18,457
In his ear. Well...
Yeah, he sniped you.

630
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,459
All the top agents used to
do that before I got here.

631
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,261
I really thought he made
some great points.

632
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:25,064
Women.

633
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,565
All right, have you had any
field training since then?

634
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,599
10 years is a long time.

635
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:29,268
No, ma'am.

636
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:31,904
Normally, I would send you back to
The Farm, but there's no time...

637
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:34,240
and I can't take a chance of
anyone leaking your name.

638
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,108
Am I going?

639
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,709
You're going.

640
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:40,212
Okay. Jeez. Sorry.

641
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:44,016
But it's a track and report
mission only.

642
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,717
Got it.

643
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:46,919
We'll be giving you
a new identity.

644
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,687
You'll no longer be
Susan Cooper.

645
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,890
I had a few ideas for that.
Your new name...

646
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:52,524
I was just spitballing
and I thought...

647
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:54,626
Seraphina, Maddox, Gisele...

648
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,596
Carol Jenkins.

649
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,298
If I may, ma'am,

650
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:02,434
there was a 13-year-old girl
named Carol...

651
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:04,570
that used to kind of take me
around the neighborhood...

652
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,205
and use my braid
as a dog leash...

653
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,340
and make me beg for biscuits...

654
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:09,976
Carol Jenkins.

655
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:12,378
Yes. Carol Jenkins, huh?

656
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:14,881
Carol Jenkins
is a single mother of four...

657
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:17,049
temporarily relocated
from Delaware

658
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,885
to increase sales
for a software company.

659
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:22,354
Okay, that is... a
different occup...

660
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:26,325
Is there a problem? No.

661
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:29,158
I was just wondering if this was my
family, or if I had taken hostages.

662
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,697
I'm just not sure...

663
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,000
how De Luca is gonna take me
seriously if I look like this.

664
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:36,035
De Luca is not going to
take you anything.

665
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:37,203
In case you did not hear me...

666
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:38,604
you are not to make
direct contact

667
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:40,306
with any of the targets.

668
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,774
Track and report.

669
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:44,343
We're setting you up
in a surveillance office

670
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:45,978
across the street
from De Luca's.

671
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:47,513
You'll be tapped into
the same telecom trunk...

672
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:50,016
and have access to voice and
data coming into his office...

673
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,249
and that is as sexy as it gets.

674
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,019
One mistake,

675
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:55,387
and we've got a nuclear bomb
in the hands of terrorists.

676
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:56,355
Do you understand?

677
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:57,856
Yes.

678
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,890
Go see Patrick. He's got
special equipment for you.

679
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,565
Oh, my God.

680
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:07,967
What are you doing?

681
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:11,938
Did you come up
with your spy name yet?

682
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:14,406
Mine would be "Amber Valentine."

683
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,408
That sounds like
you're an adult film star.

684
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:18,177
No, I did the spy name formula.

685
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,478
"Amber" was the name
of my first pet,

686
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:20,947
and I grew up
on Valentine Street.

687
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,814
That's how you come up
with your porn name.

688
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:24,750
I thought it was your spy name!
No!

689
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:26,118
What would yours be?

690
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:28,654
"Meatball Martin
Luther King Jr. Boulevard."

691
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:30,622
Yeah. Wow.

692
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:34,226
Oh, my God.

693
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:36,627
This is so exciting!

694
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:38,897
You're a spy!

695
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,199
I know! I know!

696
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,333
Oh, my God!

697
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:42,634
You're gonna get one of those!

698
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:43,970
No, I'm not!

699
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,272
Look at that!

700
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:48,140
That looks high-tech.

701
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:49,641
It's like the future.

702
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:52,211
Patrick. Susan.

703
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,113
Hey, Patrick. Yes.

704
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,182
I was given specific
instructions by Elaine

705
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:57,415
to tailor these gadgets to you.

706
00:31:58,617 --> 00:31:59,751
- Wow.
- Wow, look at that watch.

707
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:00,785
These are not yours.

708
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:01,988
Oh.

709
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,126
Is that a rape whistle?

710
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,428
Elaine wanted you
to only be carrying items

711
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:12,464
a single woman travelling
through Europe would have.

712
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:14,033
But she could get that
at any pharmacy.

713
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:15,901
Not this whistle.

714
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,303
When you blow
through this whistle,

715
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,171
a small, poisonous
dart flies out...

716
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:21,140
neutralizing your target.

717
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:24,043
Also, it needs your
fingerprints on it to work.

718
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:25,877
That is really neat!
Stop it, that's amazing.

719
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:28,180
That is really super cool!
I love that!

720
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:30,094
This anti-fungal spray
can freeze and disable...

721
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,318
any security system.

722
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:34,520
Wow.

723
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:36,655
That is quite an image to be
carrying all over Europe.

724
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,290
It's also a pepper spray.

725
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:40,559
Why not just make it
look like pepper spray?

726
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,428
That's a pretty good idea.

727
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,595
Well, next time.

728
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,031
I can wait,

729
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:47,133
if you want to print up
a new label.

730
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:49,801
No, I'd have to turn
the printer on again.

731
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:50,835
I don't really want to.

732
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,472
Each of these
are filled with chloroform.

733
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:57,076
Wow, that is an unsettling
amount of hemorrhoid wipes.

734
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:58,844
Makes me kind of wonder...

735
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:01,247
what, exactly,
is going on back there.

736
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,714
I wouldn't know.
I don't have that problem.

737
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:04,216
I don't have that problem.

738
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,052
If you ever feel like
you have been poisoned...

739
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:07,586
chew one of these.

740
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:14,626
Have I done something
to you to upset you?

741
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:18,497
Because this is
a peculiar theme.

742
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,667
Finally, every agent gets
a night vision scope...

743
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,302
hidden in their watch.

744
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,771
I have heard about this.
I've been looking...

745
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:27,339
Oh. Who's that?

746
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:29,275
That is Bette Midler
and Barbara Hershey.

747
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,143
From Beaches.

748
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:35,314
How much am I supposed
to like Beaches?

749
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,616
I would imagine a lot,
if you have the watch.

750
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,418
- Hey, Pat, I'm flying!
- Anthony!

751
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,087
Don't wear out
the battery on that.

752
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,788
Am I getting that?

753
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:44,856
No, you're not gonna get that.

754
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,090
I've already packed your bags.
Hurry up and get dressed.

755
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:50,496
Carol Jenkins has to get
to the airport immediately.

756
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,930
And may I say...

757
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:52,931
I think it's very brave
of you to sacrifice

758
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,500
your life for your country.

759
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,702
I'm not sacrifi...
I'm coming back.

760
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,271
Let's see.

761
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:02,074
Hey, Pat! I'm gonna totally
crop dust these guys.

762
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:03,309
Way to go, Anthony.

763
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:05,277
Oh, just pardon me.

764
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:06,591
Oh, God.
I think I shit my pants.

765
00:34:17,956 --> 00:34:20,025
You look amazing, Susan.

766
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,361
I look like someone's
homophobic aunt.

767
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:29,301
Wow.

768
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:31,137
Hotel Modiere, please.

769
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:34,740
This is so exciting.

770
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:35,773
Ooh.

771
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:37,776
The Louvre.

772
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:40,179
Wow.

773
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:41,847
That's a beautiful hotel.

774
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,215
Not that one?

775
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:44,816
I hope it's that.
Is it that one?

776
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,886
Nope. Oh... Maybe next time.

777
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,390
I think we're getting into
a little dicier of an area.

778
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:54,925
Ooh. That's a little unsavory.

779
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:58,630
I think we can probably
go back towards...

780
00:34:58,664 --> 00:34:59,664
my hotel.

781
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,700
No, no, no.

782
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:04,170
No, this...

783
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:08,374
I don't believe this could be
the Hotel Modiere.

784
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:12,311
This is. Yes, it is.

785
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:38,837
Oh, man.

786
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:53,719
Keep it together, Susan, okay?

787
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:55,887
Nancy?

788
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:57,055
Please tell me you can hear me.

789
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,123
I'm here. I've got you.

790
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,658
Okay.

791
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:00,959
You'll be pleased to hear the
bats have officially gone.

792
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,128
We are now vermin free.

793
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,763
Did you get your gun, Carol?

794
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:06,865
Yes, and don't call me that.

795
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:10,636
Oh, my God. Cripes. I think
I'm having a heart attack.

796
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,572
I can't do this, Nancy. Fine
was the real spy, not me!

797
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:14,940
Don't worry.

798
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:16,642
I'm here for you, okay?
Everything is gonna be fine.

799
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,477
I'm gonna talk you
through this, all right?

800
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,230
Put your camera in.
I want to see your room.

801
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,849
No, you don't. It's that bad.

802
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:25,784
Martha Stewart had
a breakdown, kind of feel.

803
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:28,687
Oh. Wow.

804
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,056
Looks like they put you up
in The Shitz-Carlton.

805
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:32,691
Try and get some sleep...

806
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:34,726
and we'll get started
first thing in the morning.

807
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,429
I don't know what I'm gonna do
when I see that Rayna woman.

808
00:36:37,463 --> 00:36:38,930
I want her dead
for what she did to Fine.

809
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:41,300
Okay. Deep breaths.

810
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:43,969
Listen to me. You're not gonna
get anywhere near her...

811
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:45,337
so there's nothing
to worry about.

812
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,073
Oh, God. Really?

813
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:49,341
Guys...

814
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,843
there's a mouse on my tits.

815
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,512
I think you're safer there.

816
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,614
All right. Good night. Night.

817
00:36:58,784 --> 00:36:59,784
Ah!

818
00:37:09,428 --> 00:37:11,997
You got this, Susan. Okay.

819
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,699
You're a warrior.

820
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,736
You're a weapon. Okay?

821
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,505
- This is no sweat.
- Looks like you're sweating to me.

822
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:20,639
Jesus!

823
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:24,876
What are you doing in my room?

824
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,945
What, how did I get into
this shit-box hotel room?

825
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,447
Because I'm a real spy.

826
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,815
I thought you quit.

827
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:32,050
We have to stop the sale
of a nuclear bomb...

828
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,053
and they send in someone who looks
like Santa Claus' fucking wife.

829
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,356
Did you forget? I am undercover,

830
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:39,090
because you're not
supposed to be here.

831
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:41,760
I make a habit of doing things
that people say I can't do.

832
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,194
Walk through fire...

833
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:44,730
water-ski blindfolded...

834
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,598
take up piano at a late age...

835
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:48,600
and I'm gonna take down De Luca

836
00:37:48,634 --> 00:37:50,168
and Rayna and Dudaev...

837
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,470
and I'm gonna
get that bomb back.

838
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:53,305
Why do you even care what I do?

839
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,374
You really think
you're ready for the field?

840
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,543
I once used
defibrillators on myself.

841
00:37:57,576 --> 00:38:00,479
I've pulled shards of glass
out of my fucking eye.

842
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:03,281
I've jumped
from a high-rise building...

843
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:05,984
using only a raincoat
as a parachute...

844
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,386
and broke both legs
upon landing.

845
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:09,388
And I still had to pretend

846
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:11,757
I was in a fucking
Cirque du Soleil show!

847
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,559
I've swallowed enough microchips

848
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:14,960
and shit them back out again...

849
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:16,428
to make a computer.

850
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:19,097
This arm has been ripped off
completely...

851
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,533
and reattached
with this fucking arm.

852
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:23,969
I don't know
that that's possible.

853
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:25,270
I mean, medically.

854
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,106
During the threat
of an assassination attempt...

855
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,776
I appeared, convincingly,
in front of Congress...

856
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:31,843
as Barack Obama.

857
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:34,312
In blackface?

858
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:36,281
That's not appropriate.

859
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:40,018
I watched the couple that
raised me explode in a van.

860
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:42,854
I watched the woman I love
get tossed from a plane...

861
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:44,923
and hit by another plane,
midair.

862
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,292
I drove a car off a freeway...

863
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,696
on top of a train...
while I was on fire.

864
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:52,364
Not the car.

865
00:38:52,398 --> 00:38:54,065
I was on fire.

866
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,467
Jesus, you're intense.

867
00:38:58,103 --> 00:38:59,505
I took this from your minibar.

868
00:38:59,538 --> 00:39:00,939
Well, that's not right.

869
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:09,415
You're gonna ruin this mission.

870
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:11,717
No, you're gonna ruin
this mission!

871
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,652
No.

872
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,853
You are.

873
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:17,556
No, you're going to!

874
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:21,159
You, times infinity.

875
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,696
Aw... Could this hotel
be more murder-y?

876
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,007
Okay, so my office is in here...

877
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:37,509
which means that De Luca

878
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:39,778
is right across
the street at 39...

879
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:46,685
Oh, God. Tell me that's not
De Luca's building?

880
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,720
De Luca must have known
we were coming.

881
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:50,456
What am I supposed to do now?

882
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:52,057
Okay, don't panic.

883
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,493
Lemonade out of lemons.
Stay focused. We can do this.

884
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:24,255
Okay, I've got it.

885
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:26,609
I'll run it through the system.
It will take a few minutes.

886
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:33,944
Nothing's coming up.

887
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:35,673
Might just be a looky-loo.

888
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:37,669
Keep looking.

889
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:39,104
I've got a feeling
about this guy.

890
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:41,607
I've got a feeling you're
about to fuck things up.

891
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:47,145
Oh, bugger me with a fish pole.
It's Ford.

892
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,548
Sharon, Ford's in the field.
Did you know this?

893
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:51,583
Until he checks in,
there's nothing I can do.

894
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:53,852
You go make some friends,
and stop stalking me!

895
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:55,954
Was it your mission
to tip off the target

896
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:58,456
so he burns everything
in advance?

897
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:01,259
If so, well done.
Phenomenal job.

898
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,671
I'm sure they got
suspicious because they've

899
00:41:02,683 --> 00:41:03,795
been seeing you all
over the place!

900
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:05,030
You're gonna
get yourself killed.

901
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:06,131
Nothing kills me.

902
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:09,100
I'm immune to 179
different types of poison.

903
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:12,137
I know, because I ingested
them all at once...

904
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,672
when I was deep undercover...

905
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:16,742
in an underground,
poison-ingesting crime ring.

906
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:18,476
Wow. It was like dog fighting.

907
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,878
But instead of dogs fighting,

908
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,813
it was humans
ingesting poison...

909
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:23,849
and rich people would bet...

910
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:25,651
whether we would live or die.

911
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:28,153
Yeah, I'm having
a hard time with this one.

912
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:30,421
I died for five minutes,
and then I came back to life.

913
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:31,890
What's he wear...?

914
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:33,625
He looks like
he's in the cast of Newsies.

915
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,661
Does Crocker
even know you're here?

916
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:36,695
I don't need anyone's permission

917
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:38,296
to save the country...

918
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,431
and avenge my dear friend
Bradley Fine's death.

919
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:41,867
You didn't even like him.

920
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,669
You used to call him
"Beverly Whine"!

921
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:46,237
You had him as Secret Santa
and you gave him tampons!

922
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:47,505
It's called the rivalry of men.

923
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:48,974
You wouldn't understand.

924
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,643
Unless you've got a dong up
underneath that skirt.

925
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:53,344
That is super rude,
and don't say "dong"...

926
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:54,780
and don't do that!

927
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:57,883
Nobody sees me
when I don't want them to.

928
00:41:57,916 --> 00:42:00,051
I move like a fucking shadow.

929
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,489
He's gone all sorts of rogue.

930
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,524
Sharon says he really did quit.
Elaine couldn't stop him.

931
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:08,059
He's out for blood.

932
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:10,093
Yeah, real tough guy in his
Louis Vuitton backpack.

933
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,800
Nancy, do you see that?

934
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:16,201
It's the man from the fire.

935
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:18,570
I'm following him.

936
00:42:18,604 --> 00:42:20,639
Oh. Exciting!

937
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:22,240
And I'm following you,
following him,

938
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:23,541
so I'm having quite a day, here.

939
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:32,417
Do you think Ford's
leading him into a trap?

940
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,552
Idiot doesn't even know
he's being followed.

941
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:39,991
He's meeting with some woman.

942
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:42,227
I don't recognize her. You
have any idea who she is?

943
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,461
No, it's hard to make out.

944
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:44,494
Can you get any closer?

945
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:50,068
Nancy, our guy just switched out.

946
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:51,261
Ford's backpack. It's a setup.

947
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:55,807
Uh... I gotta go warn him!

948
00:42:55,841 --> 00:42:57,508
Ford! Ford!

949
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:59,510
Look out! I gotta get through!

950
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:01,079
I left my baby in the shop!

951
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:03,481
Get out of the way!
Let me through, I'm sick!

952
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,851
Susan, tell them
you've shat your pants.

953
00:43:05,884 --> 00:43:06,918
That would get me
out of your way, for sure.

954
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:09,621
I've shat my pants!

955
00:43:09,655 --> 00:43:11,089
Excuse me. Ford!

956
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:14,524
He's got a friend.

957
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:18,830
Hello, everybody!

958
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:32,711
Ford!

959
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:34,344
Ford!

960
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,980
Ford!

961
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,621
I need the mic!

962
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:45,823
No! I need... No!

963
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:47,859
No!

964
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:50,495
No, no, no!

965
00:43:50,528 --> 00:43:51,763
Susan, you're meant
to be blending in.

966
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:53,865
What are you doing?

967
00:43:53,899 --> 00:43:55,000
God! Move!

968
00:43:56,702 --> 00:43:58,369
Rick Ford!

969
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:00,805
Give me the mic!

970
00:44:03,508 --> 00:44:05,043
How are you doing this in heels?

971
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:06,076
Oh, God.

972
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,146
Rick Ford!

973
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,350
They switched the bag!

974
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,054
Oh, fuck.

975
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:17,455
Get out of the fucking way!

976
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,690
Move!

977
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:19,725
Get out of his way!

978
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:21,325
Move!

979
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:23,627
♪ I want to see

980
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:39,443
Oh, no.

981
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:43,481
Nancy, I'm in pursuit
of one of the terrorists!

982
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,250
He took my picture!
He's gonna blow my cover!

983
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:46,752
You're in pursuit?

984
00:44:46,785 --> 00:44:49,054
What in God's name are you
gonna do if you catch him?

985
00:44:49,087 --> 00:44:51,289
Knock him out with a hemorrhoid wipe.
I don't know!

986
00:44:51,322 --> 00:44:53,424
I'm just gonna track him
and report his location.

987
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:55,360
This all seems
very Rick Ford-y to me.

988
00:44:55,393 --> 00:44:57,095
I do not condone these sexy

989
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:58,696
but reckless actions
of yours, Susan!

990
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,109
Oh, God.
He went into a building.

991
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:12,310
Okay.

992
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:15,046
Well done. That's it.
Time to call it a day.

993
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,382
Location is officially noted.

994
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:18,549
I'm following him in.

995
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:19,885
What?

996
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:21,419
I'm doing this for Fine.

997
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:32,363
He's at the top of the stairs.

998
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,099
Oh, gosh, please be careful.

999
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:36,534
You are incredibly
out of your league.

1000
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,669
This is just like when I
watched myself in a sex tape.

1001
00:45:38,703 --> 00:45:40,872
There was just a lot of floundering
and laughable moments.

1002
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:43,441
Nancy, I need you to
not talk until I ask you to.

1003
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,234
I'm sorry, it's just that
I'm really nervous.

1004
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,949
Be careful, Susan.

1005
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:58,355
Okay.

1006
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:29,988
Oh, hey.

1007
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:32,690
Imagine running
into you up here.

1008
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:34,893
I was just looking for my bird.
Just looking...

1009
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:36,694
Hey, Mr. Beanbag!

1010
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:37,863
You like birds?

1011
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:39,797
All right. All right.

1012
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:41,432
I'm gonna give you a warning.

1013
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:44,069
I don't wanna see any more of
that funny bomb stuff, you know?

1014
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:46,171
All right. That's enough.

1015
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:48,706
Drop the knife, or I'll shoot.

1016
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,909
I don't think you will.

1017
00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:53,542
You see, it works better when you
have the bullets inside the gun.

1018
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:57,916
Oops.

1019
00:46:57,949 --> 00:47:00,651
I guess that CIA training
isn't what it used to be.

1020
00:47:00,685 --> 00:47:01,845
I guess you're right, asshole.

1021
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,328
No, no, no!

1022
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:17,903
Oh, God!

1023
00:47:19,905 --> 00:47:21,572
Oh, Susan, what did you do?

1024
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,179
Oh, God, not on him.

1025
00:47:28,213 --> 00:47:29,314
Not on him!

1026
00:47:37,222 --> 00:47:38,924
Oh, God,
why did I have that stew?

1027
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:47,936
Well, Rayna's people
obviously knew Ford was in Paris.

1028
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:49,634
And getting footage...

1029
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:51,702
of a CIA operative setting
off a bomb in public...

1030
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:54,172
would be a PR coup
for any terrorist group.

1031
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,141
Do we have anything on
that woman he met?

1032
00:47:56,174 --> 00:47:58,076
Facial recognition
isn't showing anything.

1033
00:47:58,109 --> 00:48:00,445
They were all over Ford.
Are you able to track him?

1034
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:03,681
Goddamn Ford is still
off the grid in Paris.

1035
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:04,849
I know because he keeps trying

1036
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,218
to hack into our
system for intel.

1037
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:09,120
He's like a dog that gets
loose from his yard...

1038
00:48:09,154 --> 00:48:10,588
and keeps humping
and shitting his way

1039
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:11,923
through the neighborhood.

1040
00:48:11,957 --> 00:48:14,092
Would be a lot easier if...
Oh, my God!

1041
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:15,725
Oh!

1042
00:48:16,327 --> 00:48:17,562
Okay.

1043
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:19,097
Ford's is bigger.

1044
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,231
This is uncomfortable.

1045
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:23,534
Why do they always point at it?
We can see it.

1046
00:48:24,936 --> 00:48:27,505
He's dead though, isn't he?
Aw. That's a waste.

1047
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:29,040
Oh, God. A video.

1048
00:48:29,074 --> 00:48:30,508
I can only imagine what this is.

1049
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:32,043
You get everything on camera.

1050
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:33,511
Base out of the hotel,

1051
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:34,679
and go back there
after the attack.

1052
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:35,752
I'll take Renaldo to Rome.

1053
00:48:35,947 --> 00:48:37,382
"Renaldo."

1054
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:38,916
Do we have a record
of anyone with that name?

1055
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:40,470
- Not that I'm aware of.
- Nicola.

1056
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,354
Are you listening to me?

1057
00:48:43,388 --> 00:48:45,156
I was just testing the camera.

1058
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:47,225
Stop it! Find Ford!

1059
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:54,165
Wow. Oh...

1060
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:57,202
Come on, what is wrong
with this person?

1061
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:59,104
Oh, damn it.

1062
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:01,739
Well, now the screen's
frozen. Hang on.

1063
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,174
Come on, not the hourglass.

1064
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:04,608
Cooper, put down
the goddamn camera.

1065
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:06,877
Nancy, can you pull up.

1066
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:10,115
Fine's POV cam
from Boyanov's office?

1067
00:49:10,148 --> 00:49:11,516
Look on the desk.
There's some photos there.

1068
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:13,509
See if you find one of him
standing next to a car.

1069
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,494
Renaldo is a Rolls-Royce.

1070
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:25,030
Hack into the Rolls'
tracking system.

1071
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:26,264
That car is a Wraith,

1072
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:28,266
so it has a satellite-aided
transmission.

1073
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,767
Then tap into Boyanov's feed.

1074
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,069
His GPS should tell you

1075
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:32,970
exactly where De Luca
is in Rome, right now.

1076
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:34,472
I'm gonna head to the airport.

1077
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:35,740
Forget it, Cooper.

1078
00:49:35,773 --> 00:49:37,075
You're coming back immediately.

1079
00:49:37,108 --> 00:49:39,044
Ma'am, I really think
I can do this.

1080
00:49:39,077 --> 00:49:40,845
And I'm not one
to toot my own horn,

1081
00:49:40,878 --> 00:49:42,313
but you know what?
I'm gonna toot...

1082
00:49:42,347 --> 00:49:44,682
and say that I just saved
a lot of people.

1083
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:46,555
We are so close to getting
Rayna and that bomb.

1084
00:49:47,552 --> 00:49:48,792
Pull back the rug in the corner.

1085
00:49:49,254 --> 00:49:50,254
Oh...

1086
00:49:54,092 --> 00:49:55,760
You'll be given a new identity.

1087
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:56,793
Oh, thank God.

1088
00:49:57,962 --> 00:49:59,230
Oh, no!

1089
00:49:59,264 --> 00:50:00,998
Your name is Penny Morgan.

1090
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:02,700
You're a divorced
housewife from Iowa.

1091
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,802
You've sold
more Mary Kay products...

1092
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,304
than anyone else
in your state...

1093
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:07,905
and you've traded in
the free car you've won...

1094
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,807
to fund a trip through Europe.

1095
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,742
My hobbies are decoupage
and needlepoint.

1096
00:50:11,776 --> 00:50:13,744
I collect porcelain dolls...

1097
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:15,746
and I'm the vice president
of the Ames Garden Club.

1098
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,215
I couldn't even be president?

1099
00:50:17,248 --> 00:50:19,084
Maybe I should just be married
to one of the dolls...

1100
00:50:19,117 --> 00:50:21,052
just to make it extra sad.

1101
00:50:21,086 --> 00:50:22,920
Ten cats.
Why do I have ten cats?

1102
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,022
Is that even legal?

1103
00:50:25,056 --> 00:50:28,025
Fine always got to be
a businessman.

1104
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:29,760
One time
he was a race car driver.

1105
00:50:29,794 --> 00:50:30,874
Well, there's the ten cats.

1106
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:33,131
Just missing a shirt that says

1107
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:34,932
I've never felt
the touch of a man.

1108
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:36,334
Cooper, you're right.

1109
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,035
You did good work back there.

1110
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:39,570
That would have been
a real mess.

1111
00:50:39,604 --> 00:50:41,439
Thank you, ma'am.

1112
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:43,874
You still went
with the cat lady.

1113
00:50:43,908 --> 00:50:45,110
It was already in the floor.

1114
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:46,777
Ah.

1115
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,210
Great, that's a real
confidence builder.

1116
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:20,878
Did you find De Luca?

1117
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,151
He's been at the Majestic Hotel,

1118
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,681
but he's just left, heading...

1119
00:51:23,714 --> 00:51:25,116
south, okay?

1120
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:26,251
I'll guide you to him.

1121
00:51:26,284 --> 00:51:27,918
I've sent an ally to drive you.

1122
00:51:27,952 --> 00:51:30,488
Elaine said nothing fancy,
so I've gone with earthy.

1123
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,560
Ooh. Whoa.

1124
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:39,297
You wanna stop the car?

1125
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:42,167
Hi.

1126
00:51:45,303 --> 00:51:46,304
Hey!

1127
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,073
Oh.

1128
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,074
Welcome to Roma!

1129
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,176
Thank you.

1130
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:53,278
Thank you.

1131
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:56,147
I'm Aldo.

1132
00:51:56,181 --> 00:51:58,716
Like the shoe store
found in American malls.

1133
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:01,186
I'm Penny, like the penny.

1134
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,020
Like a penny!

1135
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:04,054
Or like penne alla vodka!

1136
00:52:04,088 --> 00:52:05,290
Okay.

1137
00:52:06,157 --> 00:52:07,592
Did you just grab my butt?

1138
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:09,394
Yes.

1139
00:52:09,427 --> 00:52:12,096
Come. We need
to get you to De Luca.

1140
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:17,835
Jiminy Christmas!

1141
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:23,039
Oh, my God!

1142
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:26,911
Don't worry, I have you! Ah!

1143
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:30,481
Aldo, slow down!

1144
00:52:31,716 --> 00:52:33,784
Nancy, are you sure this guy
is even an agent?

1145
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:35,286
Absolutely. He's the best!

1146
00:52:36,721 --> 00:52:38,823
There have been some
complaints filed against him.

1147
00:52:40,425 --> 00:52:42,360
Watch the road, watch the road!

1148
00:52:42,393 --> 00:52:43,894
Watch the road! Oh, my God!

1149
00:52:43,928 --> 00:52:45,162
Watch the road!

1150
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:46,396
Wow, Aldo is making great time.

1151
00:52:54,939 --> 00:52:55,939
A dead end!

1152
00:52:57,308 --> 00:52:58,776
This can't be right!

1153
00:52:58,809 --> 00:52:59,809
Oh, my God!

1154
00:53:08,953 --> 00:53:10,221
Ah! God!

1155
00:53:10,255 --> 00:53:12,122
Intriguing lady, we are here.

1156
00:53:12,156 --> 00:53:14,024
Now, you must go...

1157
00:53:14,058 --> 00:53:16,561
because I fear if I stare

1158
00:53:16,594 --> 00:53:19,397
into your beautiful green
eyes a moment longer...

1159
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:20,965
I will fall in love.

1160
00:53:20,998 --> 00:53:22,833
Oh! Too late.

1161
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:24,168
My God, does that ever work?

1162
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:27,104
I will take that as...
That's a "no."

1163
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:28,217
A "no." Take that as a "no."

1164
00:53:40,485 --> 00:53:42,320
You were just hitting on me.

1165
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:43,454
I like to play the odds.
Yeah. Well, good luck.

1166
00:53:44,088 --> 00:53:45,790
Here is my phone number.

1167
00:53:45,823 --> 00:53:48,426
Memorize it, then burn it.

1168
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:52,363
These people we are dealing
with, they like to...

1169
00:53:52,397 --> 00:53:55,566
How you say?
Murder entire families.

1170
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,302
Do you have something for me?

1171
00:53:57,335 --> 00:53:59,570
Do I have something for you?

1172
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:00,884
Would you like
something from me?

1173
00:54:01,205 --> 00:54:02,773
Not that.

1174
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:04,709
What do you want from me?

1175
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:07,011
You're supposed to have an
envelope with my gun in it.

1176
00:54:07,044 --> 00:54:08,579
I don't have a gun.

1177
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:12,317
I am just aroused
from looking at you.

1178
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:16,020
It was joke.

1179
00:54:16,053 --> 00:54:17,522
There is no gun.

1180
00:54:17,555 --> 00:54:19,824
They said you would no longer
be needing one.

1181
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:20,857
Good luck!

1182
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:23,827
Ciao!

1183
00:54:25,296 --> 00:54:28,399
Good gravy. Was Pepe
Le Pew not available?

1184
00:54:28,433 --> 00:54:29,667
Stop complaining, Suzie.

1185
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,936
You're getting more action
than I have had in days.

1186
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:33,270
Months.

1187
00:54:33,304 --> 00:54:35,105
Years. Three years and 40 days.

1188
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:36,774
Do we have an update on De Luca?

1189
00:54:36,807 --> 00:54:38,175
Yes, he should be pulling up...

1190
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,844
right about now.

1191
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:50,020
Oh, wow. He is hot.

1192
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:52,022
I'm not gonna lie to you. I don't
think I can be objective anymore.

1193
00:54:52,056 --> 00:54:54,592
I'm rooting for that guy.
I want him to win.

1194
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,985
I'm joking, Susan.
Don't report me.

1195
00:54:57,395 --> 00:54:58,763
He's handsy.

1196
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:02,166
Let's set up camp in
the pastry shop behind you.

1197
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:04,369
According to Aldo, De Luca
spends all night in the casino.

1198
00:55:04,402 --> 00:55:06,103
I'm going in, Nancy.

1199
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,605
Susan, you heard Elaine.

1200
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:10,741
Track and report. No contact!

1201
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:13,344
I'll track De Luca inside,
then I'll report.

1202
00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:15,480
And if he initiates
contact with me...

1203
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,082
I'll just go with it. Susan!

1204
00:55:18,115 --> 00:55:20,184
Your "cat lady" look is not
gonna fit in in there.

1205
00:55:20,217 --> 00:55:22,353
That's why Penny Morgan is
gonna burn her cat T-shirt...

1206
00:55:22,387 --> 00:55:24,021
and spend some
of that Mary Kay money.

1207
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,456
This is full-blown rogue!

♪ Yeah, I'm a diva

1209

00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:45,843
I really hope De Luca is still
in there, for your sake.

1214
00:55:45,876 --> 00:55:47,745
And they're not gonna
reimburse you for all that.

1215
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:49,213
You should have gone
to cheaper stores, Susan.

1216
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:50,948
Okay, I'm going offline, Nancy.

1217
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:52,082
No, wait!

1218
00:55:52,116 --> 00:55:53,116

1221

Well, buongiorno, boys!

1222
00:56:01,392 --> 00:56:04,395
If I'm not out in 10 minutes,
it's because I won the place.

1223
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:06,631
Let me just rub that for luck.

1224
00:56:06,664 --> 00:56:08,666
Oh, that's an oily scalp.

1225
00:56:18,509 --> 00:56:20,711
I'm sorry, but I have
to check you in.

1226
00:56:21,912 --> 00:56:24,214
Your name, please? Penny Morgan.

1227
00:56:24,248 --> 00:56:26,551
I don't see you on the list.
I'm so sorry.

1228
00:56:26,584 --> 00:56:28,285
She's with me.

1229
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:30,187
Darling.

1230
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,523
You're late. The way you look...

1231
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:35,059
I'd say it was more
than worth the wait. Come.

1232
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:36,461
Let's get a drink. Ow. Ow.

1233
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:38,228
Such a gentleman.

1234
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:40,765
You look absolutely stunning
tonight here, darling.

1235
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:42,433
What the fuck are you doing
in here, arsehole?

1236
00:56:42,467 --> 00:56:43,668
That's quite a tone
change, isn't it?

1237
00:56:43,701 --> 00:56:45,169
What are you doing in here?

1238
00:56:45,202 --> 00:56:47,371
You are completely
compromising me right now.

1239
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,173
I'm compromising you?
Fucking hilarious.

1240
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:50,374
You were about to cause a scene

1241
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,576
trying to get into
this fucking place.

1242
00:56:51,609 --> 00:56:53,177
Give me a little credit. What
do you think I'm gonna do?

1243
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:54,579
Run over there and be like,
"Hey, I'm a crazy lady!"

1244
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:56,213
"Where's the buffet?
I'm from the Midwest."

1245
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,682
"Where's Blue Man Group?"

1246
00:56:57,715 --> 00:56:59,950
I am not an idiot, Ford.
You are an idiot.

1247
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:01,285
You should not be
in this casino...

1248
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:03,253
because De Luca is here and
I need to get close to him.

1249
00:57:03,287 --> 00:57:05,456
How you gonna do that? How
you gonna do that, Cooper?

1250
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:06,423
What, are you gonna seduce him?

1251
00:57:06,457 --> 00:57:07,592
That your big fucking plan?

1252
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:08,926
Yeah, what if it is?

1253
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:10,360
Why is that so hard to believe?

1254
00:57:10,394 --> 00:57:12,196
Because you look like a flute
player in a wedding band.

1255
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:13,564
That's fucking why!

1256
00:57:13,598 --> 00:57:15,432
I'm here to take De Luca out.

1257
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:17,602
Ooh. It sounds romantic.
I hope you get lucky!

1258
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:19,403
God damn it, if I was trying
to sound romantic...

1259
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,572
you'd be lying on the floor,
soaking wet and breathless...

1260
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:22,940
wondering what came over you.

1261
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:25,375
But I'm not, so get the
fuck out of my way!

1262
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:27,411
I need you to rein it in,
buddy, okay?

1263
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,413
If you take out De Luca, we don't
have a shot at getting Rayna.

1264
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,516
So take it down, like,
5,000 notches!

1265
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:32,717
Take it down? That's how you get

1266
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:33,951
polonium-210 slipped
into your drink...

1267
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:35,419
and go 18 months
in intensive care

1268
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,654
for radiation poisoning...

1269
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:38,556
and go six months
without eyesight...

1270
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:40,758
while everybody you've
ever loved is gunned down!

1271
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,727
Really? Everybody that you love

1272
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,061
has been gunned down,
and just you survive?

1273
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:45,062
Did you ever think that maybe

1274
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:46,463
everybody you love
is not being killed...

1275
00:57:46,497 --> 00:57:47,932
but they're killing themselves

1276
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,000
because they can't stand
to be around you?

1277
00:57:50,034 --> 00:57:51,636
This shit's the real deal,
life and death.

1278
00:57:51,669 --> 00:57:53,538
This, the field...

1279
00:57:53,571 --> 00:57:55,339
is a hell of a lot different than
sitting behind your fucking monitor...

1280
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:56,473
googling shit.

1281
00:57:56,507 --> 00:57:57,775
Stay away from me, Ford.

1282
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,343
And do not let De Luca see you.

1283
00:57:59,376 --> 00:58:00,745
And by the way,
I can see your gun

1284
00:58:00,778 --> 00:58:02,112
sticking out
of your back pocket.

1285
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:04,715
Unless you're so extreme that
you've got a second dick...

1286
00:58:04,749 --> 00:58:05,816
coming out of your hip!

1287
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:39,283
Konnichiwa.

1288
00:58:40,618 --> 00:58:42,452
Ma'am, these seats are reserved.

1289
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:43,854
Of course they are.

1290
00:58:44,955 --> 00:58:46,390
I'm gonna have to ask you
to wait outside.

1291
00:58:46,423 --> 00:58:48,025
Yes, absolutely.

1292
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:49,259
Nope, not a door?

1293
00:58:50,494 --> 00:58:52,630
I knew that.
Of course it's not a door.

1294
00:58:52,663 --> 00:58:53,964
It probably
happens all the time.

1295
00:58:53,998 --> 00:58:55,600
It's never happened before.
Okay.

1296
00:58:57,501 --> 00:58:58,769
Ma'am. Yes.

1297
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:04,408
Now, right here is okay.
No more exploring, please.

1298
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:05,876
Okay. Lovely.

1299
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:14,184
From Mr. De Luca.

1300
00:59:18,455 --> 00:59:19,455
Nancy?

1301
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,859
Susan. Oh, my God! Hi!

1302
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,327
I found her.

1303
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,029
I found Rayna.
She's with De Luca.

1304
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:26,396
You did it!

1305
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:28,165
Excellent tracking
and reporting, madam.

1306
00:59:42,947 --> 00:59:44,448
Oh, my God.

1307
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:46,550
Somebody just put
something in her drink.

1308
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,185
What is it? Is it poison?

1309
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:49,754
I don't think
it's a fiber supplement.

1310
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:51,822
She killed Fine, Nance.

1311
00:59:51,856 --> 00:59:55,392
I could really enjoy just
watching her die right now.

1312
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,594
She's the only one who knows
where the bomb is...

1313
00:59:57,628 --> 00:59:58,996
so Dudaev would never
get his hands on it.

1314
00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:00,097
Oh, God, Susan.

1315
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,130
What are you gonna do?

1316
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:03,934
Excuse me, ma'am.

1317
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,871
Hi, do you speak English?

1318
01:00:06,904 --> 01:00:09,373
Because I think somebody just
put a roofie in your cocktail.

1319
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,742
Are you sure it wasn't you?

1320
01:00:11,776 --> 01:00:13,978
What? No! God, I would never!

1321
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:16,113
Could you point the man out?

1322
01:00:16,146 --> 01:00:19,349
He just kind of
zipped out that door.

1323
01:00:19,383 --> 01:00:21,351
He's wearing a purple bowtie.

1324
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:31,929
Thank you, Miss... Oh.
Penny. Morgan.

1325
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,231
But it's no trouble, really.

1326
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:37,101
I think us ladies have to
watch out for each other.

1327
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,003
This kind of thing
happens all the time.

1328
01:00:39,036 --> 01:00:42,039
People often try to roofie you?

1329
01:00:42,072 --> 01:00:43,808
Once, I asked someone
for a Tylenol,

1330
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:46,010
and they gave me a Tylenol PM.

1331
01:00:46,043 --> 01:00:47,883
I'm not sure what
their intentions were, but...

1332
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:53,751
It seems
they may have found him.

1333
01:00:53,784 --> 01:00:55,304
Would you come with me
to identify him?

1334
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:57,688
Yes. Of course.

1335
01:00:57,722 --> 01:00:58,923
I'm happy to help.

1336
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:05,262
Holy shit.

1337
01:01:11,135 --> 01:01:12,937
My friend here said she saw you

1338
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:14,638
put something in my drink.

1339
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,340
I don't know
any of you people. Okay?

1340
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:18,108
I'm just in Rome on business.

1341
01:01:18,142 --> 01:01:20,477
I was about to head back
to my hotel and go to sleep.

1342
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:24,081
Perfect. Just in time
for a nightcap.

1343
01:01:24,114 --> 01:01:25,415
Apparently, there's nothing
wrong with it.

1344
01:01:25,449 --> 01:01:26,449
I don't want your drink.

1345
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:40,097
Fuck you, Rayna.

1346
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:43,768
Mmm. Scrumptious.

1347
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:47,037
So, joke's on you.

1348
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:52,442
Fuck you!

1349
01:01:54,745 --> 01:01:56,380
Fuck you!

1350
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:21,605
How long was I out?

1351
01:02:21,638 --> 01:02:23,307
You fainted just long enough
for us to laugh at you.

1352
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,842
What happened?

1353
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:25,876
It was all a dream.

1354
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:29,079
I'm just kidding.
A man's throat dissolved.

1355
01:02:29,113 --> 01:02:31,281
Sorry, I'm not usually,
you know...

1356
01:02:33,317 --> 01:02:34,952
Oh, thank you. That's...

1357
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,388
surprisingly polite.

1358
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:39,990
Sorry about that.

1359
01:02:40,024 --> 01:02:42,059
I've seen a lot of things
in my day. I just haven't...

1360
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:44,594
I have never seen that, exactly.

1361
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:46,997
Penny, do you feel the need

1362
01:02:47,031 --> 01:02:48,591
to tell anybody about
what you just saw?

1363
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:53,570
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

1364
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,273
That asshole
got what he deserved.

1365
01:02:56,306 --> 01:02:58,775
I knew from the second
I saw him, I thought...

1366
01:02:58,809 --> 01:03:00,209
"That guy doesn't
deserve a throat."

1367
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:01,879
So, good on you.

1368
01:03:04,181 --> 01:03:07,017
I would like to take you
to dinner to say thank you.

1369
01:03:07,051 --> 01:03:09,286
And we must discuss
this hideous dress.

1370
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:10,988
It's just hysterical.

1371
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:14,258
Oh, good,
that's what I was hoping for.

1372
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,427
And by the way...

1373
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:19,429
Hristo was supposed to be
looking after me at the bar...

1374
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:21,398
and making sure nobody
put anything in my drinks.

1375
01:03:26,937 --> 01:03:28,805
They'll give him a talking-to.

1376
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:31,775
Seems fair.
Maybe dock him a day's wage.

1377
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:32,742
Or shoot him in the head.

1378
01:03:32,776 --> 01:03:33,944
That always works.

1379
01:03:35,412 --> 01:03:36,746
Rome is quite amaz...

1380
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,915
Rome is the worst. Yes.

1381
01:03:37,948 --> 01:03:39,884
So boring and tacky.

1382
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:42,953
I'm so glad one of us
finally said it.

1383
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:44,227
You have lipstick on your teeth.

1384
01:03:44,688 --> 01:03:46,090
Really?

1385
01:03:46,123 --> 01:03:47,523
Looks like you ate
a box of crayons.

1386
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:48,657
Damn it.

1387
01:03:49,894 --> 01:03:51,996
Here we are.

1388
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:53,730
These should have been brought
out when we first sat down.

1389
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:55,632
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

1390
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:59,003
So far, I'm riddled with
disappointment at the service.

1391
01:03:59,036 --> 01:04:01,471
So sorry. Signora, I apologize.

1392
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:06,810
I once saw someone eat...

1393
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,914
one of these before.

1394
01:04:11,715 --> 01:04:14,718
This is... strange.

1395
01:04:14,751 --> 01:04:16,586
Do you always tear your food
up into little pieces?

1396
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:18,255
You look like a squirrel.

1397
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:20,524
I was just checking
for the consistency.

1398
01:04:22,426 --> 01:04:23,693
Mmm.

1399
01:04:23,727 --> 01:04:25,295
You eat like a baby.

1400
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:26,463
Thank you.

1401
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:30,134
So, do you like to have a
look at the wine list?

1402
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:31,635
Yes. Penny, you can order.

1403
01:04:32,937 --> 01:04:34,071
Okay. Oh!

1404
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:35,973
Has some heft.

1405
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:37,407
Okay.

1406
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:39,910
I'm feeling a red.

1407
01:04:39,944 --> 01:04:41,979
Kind of a red.
I like a lot of noise.

1408
01:04:42,012 --> 01:04:43,580
I like a little bit of...

1409
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:45,182
kind of a barky finish.

1410
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,616
I tend to like a white...

1411
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:49,719
with the grit of a hummus...

1412
01:04:49,753 --> 01:04:52,222
that's, of course,
been thinned out.

1413
01:04:52,256 --> 01:04:54,925
Just kind of jump up
in the front of your palate...

1414
01:04:54,959 --> 01:04:57,394
and then rip back and sizzle.

1415
01:04:57,427 --> 01:05:01,331
Almost a mineral
kind of dirt finish...

1416
01:05:01,365 --> 01:05:04,969
if we're having meat. Okay,
here, this is looking...

1417
01:05:05,002 --> 01:05:07,071
promising. Something with...

1418
01:05:07,104 --> 01:05:09,006
This one has
nice hints of toast...

1419
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,276
and dogwood, I assume? Hmm?

1420
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:17,414
Uh... I will have the
Sapori e Delizie.

1421
01:05:18,115 --> 01:05:19,483
Right.

1422
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:21,751
That is the name
of this restaurant.

1423
01:05:21,785 --> 01:05:23,287
Yes, I'm aware of that.

1424
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,555
So, why don't you surprise us...

1425
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,224
with something
that we don't know?

1426
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:29,059
Like a delicious bottle of wine.

1427
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:31,962
Right. Sorry, I will be back
in five minutes, okay?

1428
01:05:31,996 --> 01:05:34,364
So hard to get
good help these days.

1429
01:05:34,398 --> 01:05:36,133
Don't you find that?
I find that.

1430
01:05:38,835 --> 01:05:40,670
I know who all
your active agents are.

1431
01:05:42,973 --> 01:05:45,009
Okay, I'm sensing, uh...

1432
01:05:45,909 --> 01:05:47,477
Can I do a little do over?

1433
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:49,545
I, uh...

1434
01:05:50,314 --> 01:05:52,249
I really don't know
how to order wine.

1435
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:55,986
I'm from a small town in Iowa.

1436
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:57,687
I saved up my money
to come on this Rome trip.

1437
01:05:57,721 --> 01:05:59,589
I had a little jar
on my desk at work...

1438
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:01,058
and everybody said, "You're
never gonna make enough money."

1439
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:03,093
But I did, and I'm here.

1440
01:06:03,127 --> 01:06:06,063
And then I meet you,
and I can't afford...

1441
01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:07,531
to eat at a place like this,

1442
01:06:07,564 --> 01:06:09,399
and I'm just trying
to impress you...

1443
01:06:09,433 --> 01:06:11,335
and doing a really
poor job of it.

1444
01:06:12,836 --> 01:06:14,904
I thought as much.

1445
01:06:14,938 --> 01:06:18,042
Your cheap prom dress doesn't
exactly scream sophistication.

1446
01:06:18,408 --> 01:06:19,876
Oh.

1447
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:22,546
Well, I didn't go to prom,
so maybe it is...

1448
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:24,148
When I was a little girl
growing up in Bulgaria...

1449
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:26,416
which is the worst, by the way.

1450
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:29,519
Poor people everywhere and
cabbages constantly cooking.

1451
01:06:29,553 --> 01:06:32,089
There was this woman who was
kicked out of her house...

1452
01:06:32,122 --> 01:06:33,890
and she lost all her money.

1453
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:35,525
She couldn't even sell her body.

1454
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:38,528
So she became a clown
on the streets.

1455
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:40,830
She would perform all her
tricks standing in mud,

1456
01:06:40,864 --> 01:06:43,067
and just cry and cry.

1457
01:06:44,301 --> 01:06:45,602
You remind me of this woman.

1458
01:06:46,603 --> 01:06:48,438
Oh. Thank you.

1459
01:06:48,472 --> 01:06:51,175
I don't know what it is, but
there's something about you.

1460
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:54,111
The fainting,
the way you talk...

1461
01:06:54,144 --> 01:06:56,146
your terrible sense of style.

1462
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,315
I did get this at
quite a lovely...

1463
01:06:58,348 --> 01:06:59,483
It makes me sad
to think of you here

1464
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:01,885
spending all your
savings on Rome.

1465
01:07:01,918 --> 01:07:04,088
Come on.
We're going to Budapest.

1466
01:07:04,554 --> 01:07:05,722
Budapest?

1467
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:07,124
I have some business
to finish there...

1468
01:07:07,157 --> 01:07:09,126
and you can take my private
jet when we're done...

1469
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:10,960
anywhere you want to get home.

1470
01:07:10,994 --> 01:07:12,634
My way of repaying you
for saving my life.

1471
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,231
Okay.

1472
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:19,768
Is there a problem?

1473
01:07:24,908 --> 01:07:27,177
No. Not at all. Let's go.

1474
01:07:28,612 --> 01:07:30,080
Hey! Wait, what?

1475
01:07:30,114 --> 01:07:31,448
I'm just talking to the girl!

1476
01:07:31,481 --> 01:07:32,841
Okay, okay.
Let's not make a scene.

1477
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:35,319
Let me just
get my room key out...

1478
01:07:35,352 --> 01:07:37,454
and I'll grab a bag
and pack my things.

1479
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:39,823
It's Susan.
She's sending a code.

1480
01:07:39,856 --> 01:07:40,824
No, they can fly you back later.

1481
01:07:40,857 --> 01:07:42,292
"Shut..."

1482
01:07:42,326 --> 01:07:43,660
And if the rest of your clothes
look like that dress...

1483
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:45,061
"...down..."

1484
01:07:45,095 --> 01:07:45,895
...I can send someone
to burn them for you.

1485
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:47,264
Ha-ha.

1486
01:07:47,297 --> 01:07:48,665
"...the power." Quite a zinger!

1487
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:53,337
Shut down the power
to the Casino Di Rome.

1488
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:54,370
What?

1489
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:58,041
Shut the entire bloody
grid down, then! Now!

1490
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,075
That would be great.

1491
01:08:03,613 --> 01:08:05,894
Everybody, please remain
calm and stay where you are.

1492
01:08:13,957 --> 01:08:15,425
Oh, no! What's happening?

1493
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:25,869
I've got this.

1494
01:08:27,137 --> 01:08:29,173
What the fuck just happened?

1495
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:31,908
God damn it.

1496
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,477
Oh, my God! Rayna.

1497
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:34,811
Thank God
your hair broke your fall.

1498
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:36,446
I don't know what happened.

1499
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,482
The lights were going out, and I
don't know if it's a robbery.

1500
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:41,351
Two of your guys slammed
into me and took you down.

1501
01:08:41,385 --> 01:08:43,587
I think one of them
touched my bottom.

1502
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,700
I don't know which one,
but I definitely felt a hand.

1503
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:48,358
Are they gonna be okay?

1504
01:08:48,392 --> 01:08:49,493
I wouldn't worry about them.

1505
01:08:49,526 --> 01:08:51,295
Their fate has just been sealed.

1506
01:08:53,263 --> 01:08:56,266
Sorry. I'll let you go.

1507
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,301
Shame on you!

1508
01:09:05,575 --> 01:09:06,876
Wow.

1509
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:09,946
This is a really jazzy plane.

1510
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,615
Is this yours?

1511
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:12,716
It was my father's.

1512
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:15,585
You've never been
on a private jet before?

1513
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:16,620
Oh, no.

1514
01:09:17,621 --> 01:09:19,723
I did get upgraded
to premium economy once...

1515
01:09:19,756 --> 01:09:22,125
which was pretty plush.

1516
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,628
Premium economy.

1517
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,196
Sounds like a pen
for dirty animals.

1518
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:27,931
Yeah, probably.

1519
01:09:27,964 --> 01:09:30,734
But it was not quite like this.

1520
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:32,168
Thank you.

1521
01:09:33,136 --> 01:09:35,305
Why are you being so nice to me?

1522
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:36,940
Can't just be because
I remind you

1523
01:09:36,973 --> 01:09:38,842
of some sad Bulgarian clown.

1524
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:40,244
You remind me of my mother.

1525
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:41,777
Oh.

1526
01:09:42,546 --> 01:09:44,281
Really?

1527
01:09:44,314 --> 01:09:47,183
You know that you and I
are pretty close in age.

1528
01:09:47,217 --> 01:09:48,885
You're funny.

1529
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:50,220
It's the Bulgarian clown in you.

1530
01:09:50,254 --> 01:09:51,955
Okay. She was marvelous.

1531
01:09:51,988 --> 01:09:53,790
But she was different.

1532
01:09:53,823 --> 01:09:54,924
Eccentric, like you are.

1533
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:56,360
Oh.

1534
01:09:56,393 --> 01:09:57,427
The moment I saw you
standing there

1535
01:09:57,461 --> 01:09:58,595
in that abortion of a dress...

1536
01:09:58,628 --> 01:09:59,796
Ah... Come on.

1537
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:01,531
...it was as if to say...

1538
01:10:01,565 --> 01:10:03,925
"This is what I've got, world.
It's hideous, but it's mine."

1539
01:10:05,835 --> 01:10:07,136
This was her.

1540
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:08,705
Oh, wow.

1541
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:10,240
Hey, how'd you get
that picture of me?

1542
01:10:10,274 --> 01:10:11,741
I look amazing.

1543
01:10:11,775 --> 01:10:13,743
Hello, doppelganger.

1544
01:10:13,777 --> 01:10:15,912
She was the only person
I could ever trust.

1545
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,848
Well, here's to your mom.

1546
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:20,950
To my mother. And to you.

1547
01:10:20,984 --> 01:10:22,552
And here's to you.

1548
01:10:22,586 --> 01:10:25,255
You may never
be as wise as an owl...

1549
01:10:25,289 --> 01:10:27,291
but you'll always
be a hoot to me.

1550
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,494
What a stupid fucking
retarded toast.

1551
01:10:30,527 --> 01:10:31,961
You're delightful. As are you.

1552
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:35,732
Mmm.

1553
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:38,735
Now, where did you say
we were headed?

1554
01:10:42,706 --> 01:10:43,706
Headed?

1555
01:10:44,774 --> 01:10:46,676
Did you say where?

1556
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:48,778
Oh, God.

1557
01:10:48,812 --> 01:10:50,380
If you ever feel like
you have been poisoned...

1558
01:10:50,414 --> 01:10:51,915
chew one of these.

1559
01:10:51,948 --> 01:10:52,948
Chew one of these.

1560
01:11:08,298 --> 01:11:09,799
What happened?

1561
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:11,167
I've never seen somebody

1562
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,869
dive for stool softener before.

1563
01:11:12,902 --> 01:11:14,938
That's one thing that happened.

1564
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:15,971
What did you do?

1565
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:18,207
Did you drug me?

1566
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:19,709
Of course I did.

1567
01:11:19,743 --> 01:11:21,345
I told you,
I can't trust anybody.

1568
01:11:21,378 --> 01:11:22,698
I had to look
through your things.

1569
01:11:22,812 --> 01:11:24,781
Anyway, tell me...

1570
01:11:24,814 --> 01:11:25,915
are your hemorrhoids
particularly large,

1571
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:26,949
or just tenacious?

1572
01:11:27,351 --> 01:11:28,918
Stop texting!

1573
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:30,887
I'm not texting,
if you must know.

1574
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,256
I'm playing Candy Crush
and I just made level 95.

1575
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,289
God, that is so rude!

1576
01:11:38,428 --> 01:11:40,129
Jesus, Colin,
what the fuck are you doing?

1577
01:11:40,163 --> 01:11:42,566
I'm sorry, Rayna, but there's
been a change of plans.

1578
01:11:42,599 --> 01:11:44,067
Who paid you off, Colin?

1579
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,235
Colin hasn't worked here for,
like, eight months.

1580
01:11:46,269 --> 01:11:47,437
I'm Fredrick.

1581
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:48,638
Is that why you're doing this?

1582
01:11:48,672 --> 01:11:50,239
Because I don't remember
your fucking name?

1583
01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:51,541
Let's just say
there's some people

1584
01:11:51,575 --> 01:11:53,142
who really want
what you're selling.

1585
01:11:53,176 --> 01:11:54,944
You don't have to do this.

1586
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:57,246
I can give you a very
comfortable life, Col...

1587
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,882
Um...

1588
01:11:58,915 --> 01:12:00,283
You forgot my name again,
didn't you?

1589
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,317
No, I didn't. Yeah.

1590
01:12:01,351 --> 01:12:04,921
It's... Don't say fucking Colin.

1591
01:12:04,954 --> 01:12:07,491
Fuck! I don't give a shit
what your name is.

1592
01:12:07,524 --> 01:12:08,858
You're the fucking help!

1593
01:12:08,892 --> 01:12:11,495
Nice try, Colin... but Stan
and I already sold it to...

1594
01:12:11,528 --> 01:12:12,829
It's Fredrick!

1595
01:12:12,862 --> 01:12:13,862
Fredrick!

1596
01:12:17,367 --> 01:12:18,935
Sorry, lady, but they only
paid me for one...

1597
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:19,968
Ow!

1598
01:12:27,043 --> 01:12:28,043
Come on!

1599
01:12:30,547 --> 01:12:32,749
Rayna! Go to the cockpit
and level us out!

1600
01:12:32,782 --> 01:12:34,422
Like I know how to fly
a fucking airplane!

1601
01:12:36,986 --> 01:12:37,987
That was weird.

1602
01:12:38,321 --> 01:12:39,423
Ah!

1603
01:12:43,893 --> 01:12:45,829
Blow that thing
all you want, lady.

1604
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:48,297
Yeah? Why don't
you blow me, Colin.

1605
01:12:48,331 --> 01:12:50,534
Ow! It's Fredrick.

1606
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:57,205
Ah!

1607
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:32,876
Oh, for fuck's sake!

1608
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:35,178
I got it.

1609
01:13:35,211 --> 01:13:36,211
I know what to do.

1610
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:41,951
Are you okay? No!

1611
01:13:41,985 --> 01:13:43,987
I've got a dead man's
head up my ass.

1612
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,121
This one's for Fine.

1613
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:46,154
Downdraft!

1614
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:49,125
Not again!

1615
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:51,060
Do you have any idea
what you're fucking doing?

1616
01:13:53,296 --> 01:13:54,664
The controls are so sensitive.

1617
01:13:54,698 --> 01:13:56,633
Oh, God.

1618
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:59,368
One of these dead fuckers
just shit his pants.

1619
01:13:59,402 --> 01:14:00,402
Okay, wait a minute.

1620
01:14:02,138 --> 01:14:03,272
I got it.

1621
01:14:03,306 --> 01:14:04,373
I think I got... Okay.

1622
01:14:04,407 --> 01:14:05,509
Okay.

1623
01:14:09,045 --> 01:14:12,516
Good thing I learned to use
that flight simulator app, huh?

1624
01:14:12,549 --> 01:14:15,051
Congratulations, Penny Morgan.

1625
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:16,653
You just blew your cover.

1626
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:20,824
Now put the plane
on autopilot and get up.

1627
01:14:24,561 --> 01:14:26,796
Any bullshit, and I'll
blow your CIA brains

1628
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:28,498
all over that control panel.

1629
01:14:28,532 --> 01:14:29,866
I know what you're thinking.

1630
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:31,668
And you're wrong.

1631
01:14:33,002 --> 01:14:35,204
My real name is...

1632
01:14:35,238 --> 01:14:37,140
Did you come up with
your spy name yet? No.

1633
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:40,043
Mine would be...
Amber Valentine.

1634
01:14:40,076 --> 01:14:41,678
What are you, a porn star?

1635
01:14:42,612 --> 01:14:44,748
You're fucking hilarious, huh?

1636
01:14:44,781 --> 01:14:46,415
I'm a private bodyguard,

1637
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:47,651
and your father hired me
to protect you.

1638
01:14:47,684 --> 01:14:51,020
Bodyguard? You? Please.

1639
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:53,156
That's funny, because the
way I see it, without me...

1640
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:55,391
you would currently be crashed
in the Alps right now.

1641
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:56,693
Or you'd be laying in a morgue

1642
01:14:56,726 --> 01:14:57,894
with a hole burned
in your throat.

1643
01:14:57,927 --> 01:15:00,564
You little spoiled
piece of shit.

1644
01:15:00,597 --> 01:15:03,700
Why would my father hire
somebody like you?

1645
01:15:04,267 --> 01:15:06,402
Because he trusted me.

1646
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:07,537
And for whatever fucking reason,

1647
01:15:07,571 --> 01:15:09,706
he loved you.

1648
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:11,875
Didn't even want you to know
I was watching you.

1649
01:15:11,908 --> 01:15:13,810
So he was the one
that made me come up

1650
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:15,979
with this whole loser
Penny Morgan bullshit.

1651
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:18,414
Yeah, "You look
just like my dead mama."

1652
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:20,083
"Wah."

1653
01:15:20,116 --> 01:15:21,417
And fuck you for saying

1654
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:24,654
I look anything
like that fucking beast.

1655
01:15:24,688 --> 01:15:26,690
No wonder your father
never had the son he wanted.

1656
01:15:26,723 --> 01:15:28,625
You fuck that monster once...

1657
01:15:28,658 --> 01:15:30,960
and you just drop
the fucking mic and walk out.

1658
01:15:30,994 --> 01:15:33,296
Fuck you. Everything
you've said is a lie.

1659
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:34,864
Oh.

1660
01:15:34,898 --> 01:15:36,933
What happened? Did I hit
a little sore spot?

1661
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:38,868
Yeah, he always wanted a
son, and you knew it.

1662
01:15:40,169 --> 01:15:42,305
Look, he wanted you
to take over the business.

1663
01:15:42,338 --> 01:15:45,008
He was just afraid you were
gonna get yourself killed.

1664
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,310
So if you wanna live, and you
wanna unload that bomb...

1665
01:15:47,343 --> 01:15:48,845
you stick with me.

1666
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:51,347
And if you got
a problem with that...

1667
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,649
you know what you can do, Rayna?

1668
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:56,720
You and your bullshit accent

1669
01:15:56,753 --> 01:15:59,022
can land this fucking plane
by yourselves.

1670
01:16:00,957 --> 01:16:03,960
Okay, bodyguard.

1671
01:16:03,993 --> 01:16:06,195
But if I find out you're lying
to me about any of this...

1672
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:09,232
I'll show you ways to die
you never even dreamed of.

1673
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:14,303
Now, let's go to Budapest.
I need a fucking drink.

1674
01:16:14,337 --> 01:16:15,672
Yeah, I bet you fucking do.

1675
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:23,647
Oh, my God.

1676
01:16:25,348 --> 01:16:30,419
♪ People want my power
And they want my station

1677
01:16:30,453 --> 01:16:35,191
♪ Stormed my winter palace
But they couldn't take it

1678
01:16:35,224 --> 01:16:39,062
♪ Try to pull my status
But they couldn't fake it ♪

1679
01:16:43,232 --> 01:16:45,068
Welcome back to the Four Seasons
Budapest, Miss Boyanov.

1680
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:46,102
Don't talk to me.
You're not my friend.

1681
01:16:46,135 --> 01:16:47,170
Get away from me.

1682
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:48,938
Move. Move! I got it.

1683
01:16:50,674 --> 01:16:52,942
So, what's the plan?
Who are we meeting?

1684
01:16:52,976 --> 01:16:54,944
You're my bodyguard,
not my business partner...

1685
01:16:54,978 --> 01:16:56,813
so just focus
on guarding my body.

1686
01:16:56,846 --> 01:16:58,514
So not knowing
who we're meeting tonight

1687
01:16:58,547 --> 01:16:59,582
is gonna make me
extra effective.

1688
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:00,917
That's okay. I get it.

1689
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:02,385
I got shit to do.
You'll probably be fine.

1690
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:04,387
Why don't I go get you
a nice dress to be buried in?

1691
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:05,420
Dumbass.

1692
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:08,424
I'm meeting a potential bidder,

1693
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,126
if you must know.

1694
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,627
If they don't top
the current offer,

1695
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:12,821
the sale will happen tomorrow.

1696
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:14,297
Where? I don't know yet.

1697
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:23,206
Anton!

1698
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:24,774
Ouch!

1699
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:27,343
Anton is part of my
security team, psycho!

1700
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:29,879
Yeah, well, guess what?
I don't like his face.

1701
01:17:29,913 --> 01:17:31,380
I don't like the looks
of your face!

1702
01:17:31,414 --> 01:17:32,982
And who the fuck are you?

1703
01:17:33,016 --> 01:17:34,784
I'm the person that's gonna
cut your dick off

1704
01:17:34,818 --> 01:17:36,619
and glue it to your forehead...

1705
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:37,620
so you look like
a limp-dick unicorn.

1706
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,122
That's who the fuck I am.

1707
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:40,656
Your name should be
"Mr. Bag o' Dicks"...

1708
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:41,958
not "Anton."

1709
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:45,094
Okay. Jesus.
Let's just calm down, okay?

1710
01:17:45,128 --> 01:17:47,630
Does he not look like a bag o' dicks?
Enough.

1711
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,265
I can see why my father
liked you now.

1712
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:52,268
Amber is my hired bodyguard.

1713
01:17:52,902 --> 01:17:54,804
Be more like her.

1714
01:17:54,838 --> 01:17:57,206
And your head better not have
broken my fucking phone.

1715
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,985
We've got a big night
ahead of us.

1716
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:10,854
Don't be afraid
to clean yourself up, Amber.

1717
01:18:10,887 --> 01:18:12,421
Take a shower
is what I'm saying.

1718
01:18:12,455 --> 01:18:14,390
Yeah? Don't be afraid
to hit water yourself.

1719
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:16,525
You smell like a dead hooker
that washed up on the beach...

1720
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:17,827
then roasted in the sun
for a week

1721
01:18:17,861 --> 01:18:19,128
before anybody found her body.

1722
01:18:19,162 --> 01:18:21,130
Okay. You need
to take it way down.

1723
01:18:21,164 --> 01:18:22,565
I'm sorry, that's too much.
Okay, that was too much.

1724
01:18:22,598 --> 01:18:23,933
Jeez! Too much.

1725
01:18:23,967 --> 01:18:24,967
God.

1726
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:33,042
What are you staring at?

1727
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,212
I will destroy you.

1728
01:18:36,245 --> 01:18:37,613
And then after
I'm done destroying you,

1729
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:39,783
I'll take a picture
of what's left...

1730
01:18:39,816 --> 01:18:41,951
of your body, and I'm gonna
text it to your mother.

1731
01:18:41,985 --> 01:18:43,887
With a little note that says
his last words were...

1732
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,189
"My mother was terrible.
You did this to me."

1733
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:47,323
That's so fucking mean.

1734
01:18:47,356 --> 01:18:48,591
Yeah, I'm so fucking mean.

1735
01:18:48,624 --> 01:18:49,658
You're just figuring that out?

1736
01:18:49,692 --> 01:18:50,860
Give me your coat.

1737
01:18:50,894 --> 01:18:52,561
This is a man's coat.

1738
01:18:52,595 --> 01:18:54,597
Yeah, but I don't
see a man, do I?

1739
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:56,365
I see a reject from
The Sound of Music.

1740
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:59,602
It was my mother's coat,
but she's very masculine.

1741
01:18:59,635 --> 01:19:02,471
You look like ABBA took a shit
and put a trench coat on it.

1742
01:19:02,505 --> 01:19:04,373
Well, I won't give it to you.

1743
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:05,408
I've been in this dress
for 12 fucking hours.

1744
01:19:05,441 --> 01:19:06,441
Give me your coat.

1745
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:08,044
No.

1746
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:11,114
Yeah. No, I won't give...
This is my coat.

1747
01:19:11,147 --> 01:19:12,849
I'm gonna reach through
your fucking body...

1748
01:19:12,882 --> 01:19:14,784
and rip out your back
like a fucking werewolf.

1749
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:16,986
Without tearing the jacket.

1750
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:18,521
Just so I can wear your jacket,

1751
01:19:18,554 --> 01:19:20,189
and give you a final "Fuck you."

1752
01:19:20,223 --> 01:19:21,690
Oh, no, you won't.

1753
01:19:21,724 --> 01:19:23,126
I'm gonna take
that fucking coat.

1754
01:19:24,393 --> 01:19:26,495
I warned you, you Swedish
gummy fish motherfucker!

1755
01:19:26,529 --> 01:19:27,529
Ouch!

1756
01:19:31,734 --> 01:19:32,969
Oh, my God.

1757
01:19:33,736 --> 01:19:34,938
Oh, my God.

1758
01:19:36,139 --> 01:19:37,807
Nance? Oh, my God, Susan!

1759
01:19:37,841 --> 01:19:40,209
Hello. Hello?

1760
01:19:40,243 --> 01:19:41,544
Just say something
to me, please.

1761
01:19:41,577 --> 01:19:43,112
Susan? Anything.

1762
01:19:43,146 --> 01:19:44,948
I cannot handle this, Susan!

1763
01:19:44,981 --> 01:19:46,349
There is nothing in real life

1764
01:19:46,382 --> 01:19:47,450
that someone could
do to a spy...

1765
01:19:47,483 --> 01:19:49,652
that is filthier
or more upsetting

1766
01:19:49,685 --> 01:19:51,087
than what my brain
will cook up right now.

1767
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,789
So save me from myself, Susan!

1768
01:19:53,823 --> 01:19:54,891
Because you know
what's going to happen.

1769
01:19:54,924 --> 01:19:56,559
I'm gonna get chattier,
aren't I?

1770
01:19:56,592 --> 01:19:58,995
Did you know that you can't
ever change having big pores?

1771
01:19:59,028 --> 01:20:01,831
Oh, my God, Nancy,
you are driving me nuts!

1772
01:20:01,865 --> 01:20:04,033
I couldn't talk because I was in
an elevator filled with people.

1773
01:20:04,067 --> 01:20:06,235
You're all right. Oh, thank God.

1774
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:08,872
You disappeared for 12 hours.
We didn't know what happened!

1775
01:20:08,905 --> 01:20:11,240
I had to take out my earpiece
and my camera.

1776
01:20:11,274 --> 01:20:12,914
Rayna's on to our agents
and she was gonna

1777
01:20:12,942 --> 01:20:14,610
spot my equipment
from a mile away.

1778
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:16,312
You're with Rayna?

1779
01:20:16,345 --> 01:20:18,948
You're not supposed to be
within a mile away of her.

1780
01:20:18,982 --> 01:20:20,483
Nancy, I know, but I'm in deep

1781
01:20:20,516 --> 01:20:22,018
and I'm getting such good intel.

1782
01:20:22,051 --> 01:20:23,386
Please, I just need to remain

1783
01:20:23,419 --> 01:20:25,354
on radio silence
just a little bit longer.

1784
01:20:25,388 --> 01:20:26,822
Well, don't worry,
because I'll be able

1785
01:20:26,856 --> 01:20:28,124
to keep a better eye on you now.

1786
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:29,397
What are you talking about? How?

1787
01:20:31,094 --> 01:20:32,962
What are you doing here?

1788
01:20:32,996 --> 01:20:34,630
Elaine wanted to know exactly
what you were up to...

1789
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:37,166
so I tracked your earpiece.
They sent me here to find you.

1790
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:38,467
They sent you?

1791
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:39,903
I'm as unknown as you are,

1792
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,104
so they thought
my cover was safe.

1793
01:20:41,137 --> 01:20:42,405
Did they give you an identity?

1794
01:20:42,872 --> 01:20:44,407
It's so cool.

1795
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,542
I said I wanted to be
Amber Valentine... What?

1796
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:48,077
...and they let me use it.

1797
01:20:48,111 --> 01:20:49,245
I don't know why you got
to pick your identity.

1798
01:20:49,278 --> 01:20:50,746
I had to go
as a freaking cat lady.

1799
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:51,881
- Amber!
- Yes?

1800
01:20:51,915 --> 01:20:53,249
Who is this?

1801
01:20:53,282 --> 01:20:54,817
I'm sorry. I didn't know
the police were here.

1802
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,619
This is my colleague, detective.

1803
01:20:56,652 --> 01:20:57,887
The one I fucking
told you about.

1804
01:20:57,921 --> 01:20:59,222
No, you didn't.

1805
01:20:59,255 --> 01:21:00,924
Yes, I did, Helen Keller!

1806
01:21:00,957 --> 01:21:02,158
You're both named Amber?

1807
01:21:03,226 --> 01:21:05,528
What did I tell you
about talking to me?

1808
01:21:05,561 --> 01:21:07,696
Nothing. You just said
nothing about talking.

1809
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:09,265
You want me to have Cagney

1810
01:21:09,298 --> 01:21:11,067
and fucking Lacey
explain it to you?

1811
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:12,768
Cagney's coming down
your fucking throat.

1812
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:14,137
Lacey, she's gonna
come up your ass.

1813
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:15,972
I'm gonna meet them
in the fucking middle...

1814
01:21:16,005 --> 01:21:17,706
and play your heart
like a fucking accordion.

1815
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:19,742
I'm gonna pump
that shit until it pops.

1816
01:21:19,775 --> 01:21:20,910
You Swedish bitch.

1817
01:21:20,944 --> 01:21:22,511
You wouldn't dare.

1818
01:21:22,545 --> 01:21:24,747
You gonna cry, you little
Swiss fucking pussy?

1819
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:26,149
I'm not gonna cry.
You're crying now!

1820
01:21:26,182 --> 01:21:27,383
I'm not!

1821
01:21:27,416 --> 01:21:30,219
It's so fucking hot!

1822
01:21:30,253 --> 01:21:32,455
You know, just, let's leave
Anton alone for now.

1823
01:21:32,488 --> 01:21:33,556
Please.

1824
01:21:33,589 --> 01:21:34,589
What's your name?

1825
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:36,359
Susan Cooper. What?

1826
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:40,296
Sorry, it came out.
What did I...

1827
01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:41,830
She's not supposed to
fucking say her real name.

1828
01:21:41,864 --> 01:21:43,632
She's one of my best. She's
highly fucking skilled.

1829
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:44,934
Very skilled.

1830
01:21:44,968 --> 01:21:47,136
At what? Getting things
out of a high cupboard?

1831
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:49,072
Don't do that.

1832
01:21:49,105 --> 01:21:51,607
That's very good!
Because I'm tall.

1833
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,943
Weirdly, I'm not very good
at reaching high things.

1834
01:21:53,977 --> 01:21:56,537
A doctor once said to me I have
the muscle capacity of an infant.

1835
01:21:56,612 --> 01:21:57,772
My arms are like two noodles.

1836
01:22:08,057 --> 01:22:09,358
Susan, get Rayna to safety, now!

1837
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:11,127
I've got her.

1838
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,160
Go!

1839
01:22:16,532 --> 01:22:17,532
Get away!

1840
01:22:23,506 --> 01:22:24,840
Oh, my God!

1841
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:27,210
Who puts a roof on a scooter?
What are you, the Pope?

1842
01:22:38,354 --> 01:22:39,354
Ooh!

1843
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,184
Get out of the way!

1844
01:22:43,926 --> 01:22:45,028
Oh!

1845
01:22:49,498 --> 01:22:50,566
Oh, my God!

1846
01:22:58,541 --> 01:23:00,581
This guy is driving crazy!
I can't keep up with him!

1847
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:04,113
Wait a minute.

1848
01:23:06,115 --> 01:23:07,150
I got it.

1849
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:10,186
All right, little detour.

1850
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:18,661
Oh, God.

1851
01:23:18,694 --> 01:23:19,694
Let's do this!

1852
01:23:26,969 --> 01:23:29,472
I am so badass!

1853
01:23:33,542 --> 01:23:34,677
I got it.

1854
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:35,750
I know what you're saying.

1855
01:23:36,645 --> 01:23:38,081
You're no prize yourself!

1856
01:23:38,114 --> 01:23:39,114
Get back to work!

1857
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:43,786
Where are we going?

1858
01:23:43,819 --> 01:23:45,654
Smells like cheese under here!

1859
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:48,124
Apologies. I may be sweating...

1860
01:23:48,157 --> 01:23:51,860
cheese because I had
quite a hearty lasagna.

1861
01:23:51,894 --> 01:23:54,029
Fucking ridiculous clown show!

1862
01:23:54,063 --> 01:23:55,598
This fuckery stops now.

1863
01:24:16,919 --> 01:24:18,221
Excuse me, do you know

1864
01:24:18,254 --> 01:24:19,422
if there's a Popeyes Chicken
around here?

1865
01:24:19,455 --> 01:24:20,723
What?

1866
01:24:20,756 --> 01:24:22,956
I saw a KFC down the way,
but I'm more of a Popeyes guy.

1867
01:24:24,693 --> 01:24:25,861
The food is really weird...

1868
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:27,214
Oh, my God,
I'll ask someone else!

1869
01:24:43,479 --> 01:24:44,680
Okay, enough!

1870
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:57,024
Drop your weapon!

1871
01:24:58,894 --> 01:25:00,263
Oh, my God. Karen.

1872
01:25:00,296 --> 01:25:01,964
Why aren't you in Capri?

1873
01:25:01,997 --> 01:25:04,467
I'm so sorry I shot you.

1874
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,868
You must not have known
it was me, either.

1875
01:25:05,901 --> 01:25:06,901
I changed my hair.

1876
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:09,004
Oh, yeah.

1877
01:25:09,037 --> 01:25:10,706
Looks really good.
Are those extensions?

1878
01:25:11,707 --> 01:25:13,776
No, it's just my hair.

1879
01:25:13,809 --> 01:25:15,043
You know, a few clips. Colored.

1880
01:25:15,077 --> 01:25:16,979
Okay, if you say so.

1881
01:25:17,012 --> 01:25:18,714
I'm sorry. And I'm sorry
about this, too.

1882
01:25:25,721 --> 01:25:26,721
Oh, my God.

1883
01:25:30,493 --> 01:25:32,995
No, no, no!

1884
01:25:33,028 --> 01:25:35,964
Susan! My thighs are on fire!

1885
01:25:35,998 --> 01:25:38,167
I don't care! Where is Rayna?

1886
01:25:38,201 --> 01:25:39,134
I don't know.
She slipped off me.

1887
01:25:39,168 --> 01:25:40,603
I was very sweaty.

1888
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:42,271
I thought I asked you
to watch her.

1889
01:25:42,305 --> 01:25:44,139
I don't know how she ran so fast,
particularly with that hair.

1890
01:25:44,173 --> 01:25:46,008
It must weigh
20 pounds at least.

1891
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:48,010
Maybe she's a witch. Do you
think she put a spell on me?

1892
01:25:48,043 --> 01:25:49,212
Karen Walker is dead.

1893
01:25:49,245 --> 01:25:50,846
What? She's a double agent!

1894
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:51,880
Somebody shot her
right in front of me.

1895
01:25:51,914 --> 01:25:53,216
I don't know who did it.

1896
01:25:53,249 --> 01:25:54,283
I don't know how deep
this whole thing goes.

1897
01:25:54,317 --> 01:25:55,551
Oh, my God.

1898
01:25:57,953 --> 01:26:00,756
Get your motherfucking
asses up here!

1899
01:26:00,789 --> 01:26:01,789
Now!

1900
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:05,027
But what if she heard?

1901
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:06,495
She didn't hear.

1902
01:26:06,529 --> 01:26:08,030
But what if she did hear?

1903
01:26:08,063 --> 01:26:10,233
We weren't even
talking that loud.

1904
01:26:10,266 --> 01:26:11,700
A woman like that
has super ears.

1905
01:26:11,734 --> 01:26:13,469
Okay, she does not
have super ears...

1906
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:15,771
and I'm only bringing this up
because you asked me to...

1907
01:26:15,804 --> 01:26:18,774
but you are putting a very
negative spin on this situation.

1908
01:26:18,807 --> 01:26:21,644
Oh, wow. We're going with that
now, are we, Amber Valentine?

1909
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:24,280
Susan Cooper, really?
Susan Cooper?

1910
01:26:39,328 --> 01:26:40,963
Okay. Here we go.

1911
01:26:43,766 --> 01:26:45,834
Okay. We got this.

1912
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:47,903
My legs won't seem to move.

1913
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:50,239
Okay, Nancy, I realize
that you are scared,

1914
01:26:50,273 --> 01:26:51,840
but you are in this now...

1915
01:26:51,874 --> 01:26:54,643
and I really, really
need you to hold it together.

1916
01:26:54,677 --> 01:26:55,911
Holding it together.

1917
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:59,748
I shall now be the most held-together
person you have ever met.

1918
01:26:59,782 --> 01:27:00,816
Okay. Let's go.

1919
01:27:00,849 --> 01:27:01,849
Oh, dear.

1920
01:27:02,785 --> 01:27:05,254
Be prepared for anything.
She's erratic.

1921
01:27:05,288 --> 01:27:07,323
It's impossible to tell
what she's thinking.

1922
01:27:07,356 --> 01:27:09,258
Probably because she's
thinking in Bulgarian.

1923
01:27:13,496 --> 01:27:16,265
What are you doing? I'm
just tying up my shoelaces.

1924
01:27:16,299 --> 01:27:17,966
You're wearing a loafer.
Get over here.

1925
01:27:25,541 --> 01:27:26,675
Get in!

1926
01:27:26,709 --> 01:27:28,977
Shit! People are trying
to kill me

1927
01:27:29,011 --> 01:27:30,613
and all that's left
of my fucking security team

1928
01:27:30,646 --> 01:27:32,047
is you two defending me...

1929
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,280
and you look like somebody's
demented aunts on vacation!

1930
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,087
Do you have anyone
on your team...

1931
01:27:39,121 --> 01:27:41,357
other than this
asthmatic Big Bird?

1932
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:43,058
Yeah, we usually just use her

1933
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:45,628
for non-physical
security resources.

1934
01:27:45,661 --> 01:27:47,830
I'm very non-physically
resourceful.

1935
01:27:47,863 --> 01:27:51,500
I do a lot of reading.
I read palms and maps...

1936
01:27:51,534 --> 01:27:53,135
and I've read all of
The Hunger Games...

1937
01:27:53,168 --> 01:27:55,003
How is that helpful?

1938
01:27:55,037 --> 01:27:56,104
I don't know. I'm panicking!

1939
01:27:56,138 --> 01:27:57,740
And you!

1940
01:27:57,773 --> 01:28:00,443
You have to stop with these
stupid Penny Morgan outfits!

1941
01:28:00,476 --> 01:28:03,211
You have to dress
like an actual human!

1942
01:28:03,245 --> 01:28:04,580
Get me more security

1943
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:06,449
when I come back out here
or you're both dead!

1944
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:11,854
♪ I am cold blooded

1945
01:28:14,089 --> 01:28:15,791
Suck on this, Rayna.

1946
01:28:15,824 --> 01:28:17,960
This mission's gonna
cost you money, you know.

1947
01:28:17,993 --> 01:28:19,995
The clothing allowance cut off
halfway through the last...

1948
01:28:20,028 --> 01:28:21,597
My God, can you just
please concentrate

1949
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:23,065
on getting the new bodyguard?

1950
01:28:23,098 --> 01:28:24,266
God damn it! Please!

1951
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:25,601
All right, all right.

1952
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:27,035
Crabby.

1953
01:28:27,069 --> 01:28:28,971
I've already contacted
the agency.

1954
01:28:30,773 --> 01:28:32,941
Aw. Come on!

1955
01:28:32,975 --> 01:28:37,613
You, in this outfit...
Magnifico!

1956
01:28:54,129 --> 01:28:55,464
Do we have anything yet?

1957
01:28:55,498 --> 01:28:57,332
No one so far, Susan.

1958
01:28:57,366 --> 01:28:59,435
Slightly intimidating
crowd, however.

1959
01:28:59,468 --> 01:29:01,003
Hello, you look nice.

1960
01:29:03,305 --> 01:29:05,808
Ah, just keep laughing.
Looks fade.

1961
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:06,841
Keep your eyes open.

1962
01:29:10,112 --> 01:29:11,780
God damn it,
I told you to dress up.

1963
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:13,682
And take off those gloves.

1964
01:29:13,716 --> 01:29:15,584
You look like
Darth-fucking-Vader.

1965
01:29:15,618 --> 01:29:17,520
Yeah? Well, you look like
an Ewok died on your head.

1966
01:29:17,553 --> 01:29:18,821
I don't even know
what that means.

1967
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:20,155
You're gonna know what it means

1968
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:21,624
when I split you open
like a Tauntaun.

1969
01:29:21,657 --> 01:29:22,725
Whatever.

1970
01:29:22,758 --> 01:29:24,026
Keep an eye out for this woman.

1971
01:29:24,059 --> 01:29:25,499
She's the one coming
to make the bid.

1972
01:29:26,962 --> 01:29:27,962
He's got a friend.

1973
01:29:28,263 --> 01:29:29,665
Very pretty.

1974
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:31,066
I'm glad you know
what pretty is.

1975
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:33,459
You should remember it next time
you're in a clothing store.

1976
01:29:34,903 --> 01:29:36,371
I need you to keep
your eyes open.

1977
01:29:36,405 --> 01:29:37,406
I may need your help out there.

1978
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,907
To close my eyes

1979
01:29:38,941 --> 01:29:40,342
in the presence
of this beautiful body...

1980
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:41,644
would be a crime.

1981
01:29:41,677 --> 01:29:43,479
Oh, God.

1982
01:29:43,512 --> 01:29:45,614
Nancy, okay, you know the woman

1983
01:29:45,648 --> 01:29:47,315
I spotted in Paris, the bomber?

1984
01:29:47,349 --> 01:29:48,917
She's coming tonight
to make a bid.

1985
01:29:48,951 --> 01:29:50,619
She already works for De Luca
so we know something is up.

1986
01:29:50,653 --> 01:29:51,987
I need you to keep an...

1987
01:29:53,489 --> 01:29:55,591
Son of a bee sting.

1988
01:30:00,596 --> 01:30:01,830
Excuse me, he's mine.

1989
01:30:01,864 --> 01:30:02,864
Yeah.

1990
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:05,167
I didn't mean
to hit her that hard.

1991
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:06,435
You're like a balloon animal.

1992
01:30:06,469 --> 01:30:07,470
Here, take those.

1993
01:30:08,303 --> 01:30:10,405
Hi. What are you doing, Ford?

1994
01:30:10,439 --> 01:30:11,774
I'm here to help you, Cooper.

1995
01:30:11,807 --> 01:30:13,909
You may have found Rayna,
but you cannot lose her.

1996
01:30:13,942 --> 01:30:16,144
This isn't fucking playtime anymore!
Yeah?

1997
01:30:16,178 --> 01:30:18,581
It's playtime on your face,
with your stupid mustache!

1998
01:30:18,614 --> 01:30:20,549
Where'd you get that from,
Mr. Potato Head?

1999
01:30:20,583 --> 01:30:22,651
You are gonna
blow my fucking cover.

2000
01:30:22,685 --> 01:30:25,053
Yeah? Sunglasses are not a
cover, they're an accessory.

2001
01:30:25,087 --> 01:30:26,555
Get out of here!

2002
01:30:26,589 --> 01:30:29,091
You're gonna fuck this up without
me around to save your girly ass.

God, I hate you so much!

2004

You can't let your desire for
me put you in danger, Cooper.

2005
01:30:33,328 --> 01:30:35,397
Oh, God, you wish, Magnum.

2006

You dance like
a horny eighth grader.

Don't, you son of a bitch.

01:34:02,671 --> 01:34:03,706
Okay. Okay.

2075
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:06,775
Oh, shit.

2076
01:34:07,242 --> 01:34:08,711
Ow!

2077
01:34:09,778 --> 01:34:11,379
Why'd I get rid of my gloves?

2078
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:36,805
Ow! Motherbutler!

2079
01:34:48,616 --> 01:34:50,136
You got a lot of rage
in that jumpsuit.

2080
01:35:09,404 --> 01:35:10,404
You dead serious?

2081
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:13,675
God!

2082
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,143
Wait! Wait a minute!

2083
01:35:16,745 --> 01:35:19,714
This isn't what you want,
or what I want.

2084
01:35:20,615 --> 01:35:22,550
This is like what the Man wants.

2085
01:35:22,584 --> 01:35:25,720
Us, you know? Two smart,
pretty brunettes...

2086
01:35:25,754 --> 01:35:27,622
kind of breaking
each other down.

2087
01:35:27,655 --> 01:35:30,292
I mean, you look similar to a
gal I was in college with.

2088
01:35:30,325 --> 01:35:31,526
Things happened.

2089
01:35:31,559 --> 01:35:32,928
I think we all dabble.

2090
01:35:32,961 --> 01:35:35,630
It's mostly just kind of
stuff with hands and...

2091
01:35:35,663 --> 01:35:37,065
God, I can't wait to kill you.

2092
01:36:03,425 --> 01:36:04,425
Oh...

2093
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:06,361
That's clean through.

2094
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:08,964
Thanks for your weapon.

2095
01:36:08,997 --> 01:36:10,265
It's been inside you,

2096
01:36:10,298 --> 01:36:11,938
so I don't think
it should go inside me...

2097
01:36:22,811 --> 01:36:24,279
Get up. Get up!

2098
01:36:27,449 --> 01:36:30,052
You are under arrest
by Susan Cooper...

2099
01:36:30,085 --> 01:36:31,645
and the government
of the United States.

2100
01:36:41,696 --> 01:36:43,298
Rayna, how did you do that?

2101
01:36:43,331 --> 01:36:44,331
I didn't.

2102
01:36:44,666 --> 01:36:45,666
He did.

2103
01:36:53,175 --> 01:36:54,175
Hello, Coop.

2104
01:36:57,512 --> 01:36:58,580
Fine?

2105
01:36:58,613 --> 01:36:59,613
Ow...

2106
01:37:00,315 --> 01:37:01,516
Hey.

2107
01:37:02,484 --> 01:37:03,551
Coop.

2108
01:37:16,498 --> 01:37:17,565
Wake up!

2109
01:37:18,566 --> 01:37:20,668
Did you have a nice nap?

2110
01:37:20,702 --> 01:37:22,504
You were snoring very loudly.

2111
01:37:22,537 --> 01:37:23,838
That's just really not the most

2112
01:37:23,872 --> 01:37:25,773
upsetting news right now.

2113
01:37:25,807 --> 01:37:27,943
My father used to
bring people here.

2114
01:37:27,976 --> 01:37:30,545
Did he also make you dress
like a slutty dolphin trainer?

2115
01:37:30,578 --> 01:37:33,681
He'd starve them...
torture them.

2116
01:37:33,715 --> 01:37:35,150
You name it.

2117
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:36,618
But he especially didn't like it

2118
01:37:36,651 --> 01:37:38,020
when people lied to him.

2119
01:37:39,021 --> 01:37:40,588
Not that I bought it.

2120
01:37:40,622 --> 01:37:41,656
You knew?

2121
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:43,125
Of course I knew.

2122
01:37:43,158 --> 01:37:45,793
I told you, you were better
off in the basement, Coop.

2123
01:37:45,827 --> 01:37:47,195
You could have
avoided all of this.

2124
01:37:47,229 --> 01:37:48,830
And what, Fine?

2125
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:50,565
Now you're a nuclear
black marketer?

2126
01:37:50,598 --> 01:37:51,633
A terrorist?

2127
01:37:51,666 --> 01:37:53,335
No...

2128
01:37:54,402 --> 01:37:56,071
He's just fucking me.

2129
01:38:03,745 --> 01:38:04,913
You're a loud kisser.

2130
01:38:05,981 --> 01:38:07,950
Excuse me? You're a loud kisser.

2131
01:38:07,983 --> 01:38:10,185
And it's gross and unappealing.

2132
01:38:10,218 --> 01:38:11,719
You look like some
old, toothless woman

2133
01:38:11,753 --> 01:38:13,055
sucking the jelly
out of a donut.

2134
01:38:14,522 --> 01:38:15,991
Hey, what's it like
sleeping with the man

2135
01:38:16,024 --> 01:38:17,559
that killed your father?

2136
01:38:17,592 --> 01:38:18,592
Nice try, Coop.

2137
01:38:20,195 --> 01:38:21,964
She already knows it was Cress.

2138
01:38:22,164 --> 01:38:23,298
Ah.

2139
01:38:23,331 --> 01:38:24,766
Okay.

2140
01:38:24,799 --> 01:38:28,136
You've probably always been in
love with him, haven't you?

2141
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:30,438
Talking in his ear...

2142
01:38:30,472 --> 01:38:33,241
hoping eventually one day
he'll fall in love with you.

2143
01:38:35,077 --> 01:38:37,679
Poor little,
pathetic Susan Coleman.

2144
01:38:37,712 --> 01:38:39,114
That's not my last name,

2145
01:38:39,147 --> 01:38:40,747
so it's really not much
of a burn, is it?

2146
01:38:40,782 --> 01:38:41,816
Cooping.

2147
01:38:41,849 --> 01:38:42,884
No.

2148
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:44,152
Croupon.

2149
01:38:44,186 --> 01:38:46,154
Are you thinking "Groupon"?

2150
01:38:46,188 --> 01:38:47,722
No, my name's not "Groupon."

2151
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:49,524
Croupe. Keep going.

2152
01:38:49,557 --> 01:38:50,959
Kapowski.

2153
01:38:50,993 --> 01:38:52,527
That's getting further from it!

2154
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:55,730
Well, whatever the fuck it is,
let's just call you dead.

2155
01:38:55,763 --> 01:38:57,299
Hey, baby?

2156
01:38:57,332 --> 01:38:58,433
I thought we were gonna hang
on to her till tonight.

2157
01:38:58,466 --> 01:39:00,002
I changed my mind.

2158
01:39:03,305 --> 01:39:04,339
Goodbye.

2159
01:39:09,211 --> 01:39:10,678
Like I'd waste a bullet on you.

2160
01:39:12,747 --> 01:39:13,982
Put her in the room.

2161
01:39:23,191 --> 01:39:24,191
Ah!

2162
01:39:32,467 --> 01:39:33,467
Hey, Aldo.

2163
01:39:34,636 --> 01:39:36,838
Hello, captured lady.

2164
01:39:36,871 --> 01:39:38,206
I failed.

2165
01:39:39,641 --> 01:39:40,675
I failed the mission.

2166
01:39:41,676 --> 01:39:45,513
Fine is alive... and
he's a traitor.

2167
01:39:45,547 --> 01:39:47,182
Don't be downhearted.

2168
01:39:49,084 --> 01:39:51,453
My mama said to me...

2169
01:39:51,486 --> 01:39:56,558
"Aldo, life is full of sorrow..."

2170
01:39:56,591 --> 01:39:58,060
"and surprises."

2171
01:39:59,094 --> 01:40:04,732
"But, a magnificent
pair of bosoms..."

2172
01:40:05,867 --> 01:40:08,070
"will..."

2173
01:40:10,905 --> 01:40:12,207
Good story.

2174
01:40:24,586 --> 01:40:26,121
Susan.

2175
01:40:26,154 --> 01:40:27,655
Get away from me. No, listen.

2176
01:40:27,689 --> 01:40:29,091
I haven't got much time.

2177
01:40:29,124 --> 01:40:30,325
Why'd you do it, Fine?

2178
01:40:30,892 --> 01:40:33,295
This was my only way in.

2179
01:40:33,328 --> 01:40:36,398
I had to fake my death
to gain Rayna's trust.

2180
01:40:36,431 --> 01:40:38,666
I jammed the signal,
popped out my lens.

2181
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,535
It was easy.

2182
01:40:40,568 --> 01:40:43,338
I hated to do it to you, Coop,
but I had to. I had to.

2183
01:40:43,371 --> 01:40:45,240
Rayna knew
all about our agents...

2184
01:40:45,273 --> 01:40:47,975
because Karen Walker
sold her the names.

2185
01:40:48,009 --> 01:40:49,277
I just couldn't trust anyone
at the agency

2186
01:40:49,311 --> 01:40:51,413
not to give me away,
not even you.

2187
01:40:51,446 --> 01:40:53,081
How do I even know
you're telling me the truth?

2188
01:40:53,115 --> 01:40:55,083
Did Karen Walker
try to kill you?

2189
01:40:55,117 --> 01:40:56,551
You shot her?

2190
01:40:56,584 --> 01:40:58,653
I'm deep undercover.

2191
01:40:58,686 --> 01:41:00,622
But not so deep that
I can't still protect you.

2192
01:41:02,023 --> 01:41:03,091
All right, look me in the eye.

2193
01:41:03,125 --> 01:41:04,326
What?

2194
01:41:04,359 --> 01:41:05,793
Really look me in the eye.

2195
01:41:08,630 --> 01:41:10,698
One of your eyes is bigger
than the other.

2196
01:41:10,732 --> 01:41:11,799
Really?

2197
01:41:12,033 --> 01:41:14,068
No.

2198
01:41:14,102 --> 01:41:15,970
You're perfect, God damn it.

2199
01:41:16,003 --> 01:41:17,439
Asshole.

2200
01:41:17,472 --> 01:41:18,706
God!

2201
01:41:20,108 --> 01:41:21,376
That hurt.

2202
01:41:21,409 --> 01:41:23,611
Good, it was supposed to.

2203
01:41:23,645 --> 01:41:24,912
Bosom.

2204
01:41:24,946 --> 01:41:26,614
Is he dangerous?

2205
01:41:26,648 --> 01:41:29,016
Only if you have boobs.

2206
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:31,286
So did Rayna
really know I was a spy?

2207
01:41:31,319 --> 01:41:34,722
No. Not until you blew your
cover back at that kitchen.

2208
01:41:34,756 --> 01:41:37,091
I really thought she was more
experienced than that.

2209
01:41:37,125 --> 01:41:38,726
Thank God she's not, huh?

2210
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:41,496
Because if she was,
you'd be dead now.

2211
01:41:41,529 --> 01:41:42,969
I think they're pretty
good covers...

2212
01:41:42,997 --> 01:41:44,632
I gotta go.

2213
01:41:44,666 --> 01:41:46,768
We're heading to De Luca's
villa to meet with Dudaev.

2214
01:41:46,801 --> 01:41:49,337
Then we're taking him
to wherever the bomb is.

2215
01:41:49,371 --> 01:41:50,438
This thing is almost over.

2216
01:41:52,474 --> 01:41:53,608
Hang tight.

2217
01:41:58,313 --> 01:42:00,315
Hello, bound lady.

2218
01:42:00,782 --> 01:42:02,184
Not now, Aldo.

2219
01:42:02,217 --> 01:42:05,920
I think Mr. Fine
has underestimated you.

2220
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:08,022
You found your targets,

2221
01:42:08,055 --> 01:42:09,775
you tracked them down,
you fought very hard.

2222
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:11,359
Susan...

2223
01:42:13,094 --> 01:42:14,229
you are a good agent.

2224
01:42:16,998 --> 01:42:18,866
You'll get them next time, huh?

2225
01:42:20,635 --> 01:42:22,337
Unless we die here.

2226
01:42:25,207 --> 01:42:27,442
Then you will not.

2227
01:42:27,475 --> 01:42:29,411
You know what,
I'm not going down like this.

2228
01:42:29,444 --> 01:42:30,978
I need you to untie me.

2229
01:42:31,012 --> 01:42:32,214
Bosom. What?

2230
01:42:32,247 --> 01:42:33,848
Stop! God damn it!

2231
01:42:34,816 --> 01:42:35,816
Just untie me.

2232
01:42:36,651 --> 01:42:38,720
No, you heard Mr. Fine.
He's working a plan.

2233
01:42:38,753 --> 01:42:39,854
We have to stay put.

2234
01:42:39,887 --> 01:42:41,689
Untie me. Now.

2235
01:42:45,193 --> 01:42:46,728
That's my ass.

2236
01:42:46,761 --> 01:42:49,931
It is very difficult to see
or gauge my position.

2237
01:42:49,964 --> 01:42:51,333
You're just simply
grabbing my ass.

2238
01:42:51,366 --> 01:42:53,901
Oh. I am, sorry.

2239
01:42:53,935 --> 01:42:55,970
Let's roll to our side.

2240
01:42:56,003 --> 01:42:57,071
God!

2241
01:42:57,104 --> 01:42:58,840
Oh! Hey!

2242
01:42:58,873 --> 01:43:01,943
The knot is very tight,
but I am making progress.

2243
01:43:01,976 --> 01:43:03,545
Your hand is way up in there.

2244
01:43:03,578 --> 01:43:07,282
My right hand is restrained
from the weight of my body.

2245
01:43:07,315 --> 01:43:08,683
Okay. Let's try this.

2246
01:43:08,716 --> 01:43:09,884
Oh, God.

2247
01:43:11,419 --> 01:43:15,790
Okay. I will inchworm my way...

2248
01:43:22,864 --> 01:43:24,266
You're being very loud.

2249
01:43:28,603 --> 01:43:29,603
Shh!

2250
01:43:33,007 --> 01:43:35,743
Wait. I have idea.

2251
01:43:35,777 --> 01:43:36,777
God. Another one?

2252
01:43:37,512 --> 01:43:39,314
Oh, Jesus. Don't move.

2253
01:43:39,347 --> 01:43:40,815
Wait, wait, wait! Stay still.

2254
01:43:40,848 --> 01:43:42,083
No, no, no!

2255
01:43:42,116 --> 01:43:43,451
Yes, yes, yes.

2256
01:43:43,485 --> 01:43:44,986
Oh, God! Yes.

2257
01:43:45,019 --> 01:43:46,721
Can't be happening.

2258
01:43:46,754 --> 01:43:48,890
Damn it, I was having
such an empowering moment

2259
01:43:48,923 --> 01:43:50,992
before this started.

2260
01:43:51,025 --> 01:43:56,264
My penis may be gently kissing
the back of your head.

2261
01:43:56,298 --> 01:43:57,832
Just untie me
before I crush your nuts.

2262
01:43:57,865 --> 01:43:59,334
Oh, please.

2263
01:43:59,367 --> 01:44:01,869
If only we had time
for such pleasures.

2264
01:44:02,670 --> 01:44:04,539
Go!

2265
01:44:04,572 --> 01:44:06,941
Your face and the knot
are about to enter my colon.

2266
01:44:08,876 --> 01:44:10,312
Stop licking it!

2267
01:44:14,416 --> 01:44:15,850
It is done.

2268
01:44:15,883 --> 01:44:17,419
Thank you, Aldo.

2269
01:44:17,452 --> 01:44:19,186
I don't wanna know
why my neck is wet...

2270
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:21,088
but you did excellent work.
Prego.

2271
01:44:21,122 --> 01:44:23,057
Turn around, let me untie you,

2272
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:24,592
and let's get
the fuck out of here.

2273
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:12,206
I need you to alert
CIA and Interpol.

2274
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:14,108
I'm gonna go to De Luca's
and back up Fine.

2275
01:45:14,141 --> 01:45:15,221
You know where the villa is?

2276
01:45:17,545 --> 01:45:19,847
I know everything.

2277
01:45:19,881 --> 01:45:23,851
One day, lady super spy...
Susan Cooper...

2278
01:45:24,452 --> 01:45:25,753
I will fuck you.

2279

2280

2281

01:46:09,797 --> 01:46:11,032
Really nice.

2283
01:46:12,534 --> 01:46:14,335

2290
01:47:03,951 --> 01:47:06,153
Welcome to Lake Balaton.

2291
01:47:06,187 --> 01:47:07,589
I found this staircase

2292
01:47:07,622 --> 01:47:10,625
and made them build
a house around it.

2293
01:47:10,658 --> 01:47:13,160
Our dear Mr. Dudaev
will be arriving shortly.

2294
01:47:14,696 --> 01:47:18,666
You are about to become
a very rich woman, Rayna.

2295
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:20,668
Which means you'll have to be
a little more careful...

2296
01:47:20,702 --> 01:47:23,104
about the company you keep.

2297
01:47:23,137 --> 01:47:26,508
So many people have such
terrible agendas...

2298
01:47:26,541 --> 01:47:28,976
like perhaps your friend here.

2299
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:31,779
I can see his obvious
outer appeal.

2300
01:47:32,647 --> 01:47:34,048
You have terrific eyes.

2301
01:47:34,782 --> 01:47:36,183
Thanks.

2302
01:47:36,217 --> 01:47:38,119
But he also works
for the CIA, doesn't he?

2303
01:47:39,453 --> 01:47:43,290
An odd choice of companion for
someone in your work, Rayna.

2304
01:47:43,324 --> 01:47:46,360
Doesn't exactly inspire
confidence in those around you.

2305
01:47:46,393 --> 01:47:49,497
Fuck you, Sergio. You would never
talk to my father like that.

2306
01:47:49,531 --> 01:47:50,665
I never had to.

2307
01:47:50,698 --> 01:47:52,534
Mr. De Luca, it's true.

2308
01:47:52,567 --> 01:47:55,002
I worked for the CIA,
but they think I'm dead.

2309
01:47:55,036 --> 01:47:57,772
I'm with Rayna now, and I'm
here to help you both.

2310
01:47:58,673 --> 01:48:01,743
You and Karen Walker
are both double agents.

2311
01:48:02,877 --> 01:48:04,912
What's going on at the CIA?

2312
01:48:04,946 --> 01:48:06,681
Drones taking all
the cool assignments?

2313
01:48:09,050 --> 01:48:10,490
If we don't get rid
of him right now,

2314
01:48:10,518 --> 01:48:11,753
I'm calling off the deal.

2315
01:48:13,755 --> 01:48:16,123
Don't you fucking dare.

2316
01:48:16,157 --> 01:48:17,625
Yeah, why don't you listen
to that asshole.

2317
01:48:17,659 --> 01:48:19,794
Don't you fucking dare.

2318
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:22,564
You're a bit
outnumbered here, Miss...

2319
01:48:23,731 --> 01:48:25,032
I'm sorry, what the
fuck is your name?

2320
01:48:25,066 --> 01:48:27,802
Susan Cooper. I'm with the CIA.

2321
01:48:27,835 --> 01:48:30,605
Jesus. Rayna, did you invite
the entire agency here...

2322
01:48:30,638 --> 01:48:33,340
or are they just having
a company retreat

2323
01:48:33,374 --> 01:48:34,676
at the villa next door?

2324
01:48:34,709 --> 01:48:36,143
God, you're funny, huh?

2325
01:48:36,177 --> 01:48:37,511
It's just me.

2326
01:48:37,545 --> 01:48:38,613
It's gonna be
in your best interest

2327
01:48:38,646 --> 01:48:40,782
to keep Fine and me alive.

2328
01:48:40,815 --> 01:48:43,551
I'm trying, but I'm not quite
following your logic.

2329
01:48:43,585 --> 01:48:45,386
You want me to slow it down
for you? Okay.

2330
01:48:45,419 --> 01:48:47,054
You're about to meet
with Solsa Dudaev...

2331
01:48:47,088 --> 01:48:50,091
a man I've been collecting
intelligence on for years.

2332
01:48:50,124 --> 01:48:51,626
And I'm guessing
that your boys here

2333
01:48:51,659 --> 01:48:52,960
are too busy manscaping...

2334
01:48:52,994 --> 01:48:55,429
to have told you
how he does business.

2335
01:48:55,462 --> 01:48:57,665
Because about half the people
he deals with end up dead.

2336
01:48:57,699 --> 01:48:58,933
I can tell you what
Dudaev's gonna do

2337
01:48:58,966 --> 01:49:01,035
five minutes before he
even thinks about it.

2338
01:49:01,068 --> 01:49:04,305
And I sure as shit know enough to
cover up a Russian flag tattoo...

2339
01:49:04,338 --> 01:49:06,107
since Dudaev's brother was
killed by the Russian military.

2340
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:07,609
Jesus!

2341
01:49:07,642 --> 01:49:09,877
You own a computer?
You heard of fucking Google?

2342
01:49:09,911 --> 01:49:11,312
I'll tell you another thing.

2343
01:49:11,345 --> 01:49:12,513
You know
your little girlfriend...

2344
01:49:12,546 --> 01:49:14,782
the one from the Paris bombing?

2345
01:49:14,816 --> 01:49:16,483
She's just using you
to get to Rayna.

2346
01:49:16,517 --> 01:49:18,119
If it hadn't been for me
last night...

2347
01:49:18,152 --> 01:49:19,654
she would've kidnapped her
at the club...

2348
01:49:19,687 --> 01:49:20,622
and then you'd be standing here

2349
01:49:20,655 --> 01:49:21,823
with your dick in your hand...

2350
01:49:21,856 --> 01:49:23,224
because you'd never
find that bomb.

2351
01:49:23,257 --> 01:49:25,359
So you need me, De Luca.

2352
01:49:25,392 --> 01:49:27,595
And I'm not gonna help you
unless you keep Fine alive.

2353
01:49:34,035 --> 01:49:35,402
Now, let me get this straight.

2354
01:49:35,436 --> 01:49:36,971
You work for the CIA...

2355
01:49:37,004 --> 01:49:39,641
yet you're willing to help me
sell a nuclear bomb...

2356
01:49:39,674 --> 01:49:41,175
in order to save
this man's life?

2357
01:49:41,208 --> 01:49:42,476
Why would I believe that?

2358
01:49:42,509 --> 01:49:44,612
Because she's in love with him.

2359
01:49:46,013 --> 01:49:47,314
Yeah, so what?

2360
01:49:47,348 --> 01:49:49,016
This idiot doesn't even know it.

2361
01:49:49,050 --> 01:49:51,318
Too dumb to know
I'd do anything for him.

2362
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:54,922
And fuck the CIA, right?

2363
01:49:54,956 --> 01:49:56,758
What have they ever done for me?

2364
01:49:56,791 --> 01:49:59,026
Took 10 years of my life,
gave me shitty pay...

2365
01:49:59,060 --> 01:50:01,829
put me in a basement with
a ceiling full of bats...

2366
01:50:01,863 --> 01:50:03,865
that pretty sure gave me pinkeye
or at least an allergy...

2367
01:50:03,898 --> 01:50:05,232
Something got fucked up
in my eye.

2368
01:50:07,034 --> 01:50:08,469
I would've been out
a long time ago

2369
01:50:08,502 --> 01:50:09,704
if it hadn't been for Fine.

2370
01:50:11,973 --> 01:50:15,042
So, yeah, I'll do anything
it takes to keep him alive.

2371
01:50:16,678 --> 01:50:18,612
That's pretty pathetic, right?

2372
01:50:18,646 --> 01:50:21,015
Extremely pathetic.

2373
01:50:21,582 --> 01:50:23,350
God, you're an asshole.

2374
01:50:23,384 --> 01:50:26,020
When this is over, I'm gonna
shave that fucking head.

2375
01:50:26,754 --> 01:50:27,789
All right, Miss Havisham.

2376
01:50:28,856 --> 01:50:30,357
I'll take you up on your offer.

2377
01:50:30,391 --> 01:50:32,927
But if you try anything,
I mean anything...

2378
01:50:34,195 --> 01:50:35,697
I'll make your dream come true

2379
01:50:35,730 --> 01:50:37,370
and send you and
your boyfriend to heaven.

2380
01:50:39,333 --> 01:50:40,333
Let's go.

2381
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:54,782
Mr. Dudaev.

2382
01:50:55,382 --> 01:50:56,984
Welcome to Hungary.

2383
01:50:57,018 --> 01:50:59,687
Like Chechnya,
only easier to pronounce.

2384
01:51:00,554 --> 01:51:02,356
Enough with the bullshit.

2385
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:05,459
Where is the package?

2386
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:08,696
Once my client
sees the payment...

2387
01:51:08,730 --> 01:51:11,465
she'll take us all to its
very secure hiding spot.

2388
01:51:11,498 --> 01:51:13,667
Wherever that may be.

2389
01:51:22,143 --> 01:51:23,177
I got it, handsome.

2390
01:51:25,146 --> 01:51:26,647
100,000,000 Euros

2391
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,120
doesn't buy
what it used to, does it?

2392
01:51:31,853 --> 01:51:33,054
Nice ice, Solsa.

2393
01:51:35,122 --> 01:51:36,157
Right.

2394
01:51:37,524 --> 01:51:38,826
He's all yours.

2395
01:51:38,860 --> 01:51:41,095
Gentlemen,
if you would follow me.

2396
01:52:08,155 --> 01:52:09,390
Here it is.

2397
01:52:09,423 --> 01:52:10,724
What is this bullshit?

2398
01:52:10,758 --> 01:52:12,659
Bullshit?

2399
01:52:12,693 --> 01:52:15,729
Solsa, I'll have you know...
It's the nuke.

2400
01:52:17,331 --> 01:52:18,732
Clever girl.

2401
01:52:25,406 --> 01:52:26,406
A lead-lined compartment.

2402
01:52:27,274 --> 01:52:28,542
Correct.

2403
01:52:28,575 --> 01:52:31,345
The lead lining is thick as to
mask any radiation detection.

2404
01:52:31,378 --> 01:52:33,714
My father was extremely
good at his job.

2405
01:52:33,747 --> 01:52:35,549
Unbelievable!

2406
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:36,822
You could have warned me, Rayna.

2407
01:52:36,851 --> 01:52:38,019
I've been throwing
my gym clothes

2408
01:52:38,052 --> 01:52:39,292
on top of that thing for a week.

2409
01:52:55,803 --> 01:52:57,238
It is beautiful.

2410
01:52:58,472 --> 01:52:59,506
Yes, it is.

2411
01:53:04,846 --> 01:53:05,926
What the fuck are you doing?

2412
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:07,849
Conducting business.

2413
01:53:13,988 --> 01:53:14,988
Uh-uh.

2414
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:17,790
Put it in the helicopter.

2415
01:53:18,826 --> 01:53:19,946
And don't forget my diamonds.

2416
01:53:23,597 --> 01:53:25,099
What the fuck is going on?

2417
01:53:25,132 --> 01:53:26,834
De Luca played you, Rayna.

2418
01:53:26,868 --> 01:53:28,369
And you led him right to it.

2419
01:53:28,402 --> 01:53:30,804
You didn't expect me
to let him have it, did you?

2420
01:53:30,838 --> 01:53:33,307
I mean, it's like giving a
Stradivarius to a hillbilly.

2421
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:35,009
I have a buyer
who's willing to pay me

2422
01:53:35,042 --> 01:53:37,611
500,000,000 Euros for it.

2423
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:39,046
And Dudaev would've
never been able

2424
01:53:39,080 --> 01:53:41,548
to get that bomb
onto American soil.

2425
01:53:41,582 --> 01:53:43,517
My buyer will have it in the
middle of New York City...

2426
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:45,286
and use it next week.

2427
01:53:46,487 --> 01:53:47,989
So, you know,

2428
01:53:48,022 --> 01:53:49,256
if you haven't seen
Phantom yet...

2429
01:53:49,290 --> 01:53:51,425
So, what?

2430
01:53:51,458 --> 01:53:53,338
Does this mean you're gonna
kill me too, Sergio?

2431
01:53:53,727 --> 01:53:54,996
I'm afraid so.

2432
01:53:55,897 --> 01:53:57,331
Sorry, Rayna.

2433
01:53:57,364 --> 01:53:58,699
It's just cleaner that way.
You understand.

2434
01:53:58,732 --> 01:53:59,901
Explain it to me, De Luca!

2435
01:54:07,741 --> 01:54:09,877
God. He means well.

2436
01:54:09,911 --> 01:54:11,711
This day just keeps getting
better and better.

2437
01:54:13,247 --> 01:54:14,916
Thanks for the
performance, folks.

2438
01:54:14,949 --> 01:54:16,450
But sorry, Rayna, show's over.

2439
01:54:23,390 --> 01:54:24,390
Go! Go!

2440
01:54:43,244 --> 01:54:44,778
Holy shit.

2441
01:54:44,811 --> 01:54:46,180
Where's De Luca? Susan!

2442
01:54:47,814 --> 01:54:48,815
Get down!

2443
01:54:50,184 --> 01:54:51,252
No!

2444
01:54:51,285 --> 01:54:52,653
Whoa! Ah!

2445
01:54:58,359 --> 01:55:00,127
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

2446
01:55:00,161 --> 01:55:01,662
Rayna! What?

2447
01:55:01,695 --> 01:55:02,695
Under the car!

2448
01:55:03,830 --> 01:55:04,830
Push it over!

2449
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:08,169
Seriously?

2450
01:55:08,202 --> 01:55:10,537
God, use those fucking
bird arms and push it!

2451
01:55:19,613 --> 01:55:20,613
Oh!

2452
01:55:21,548 --> 01:55:22,548
What happened?

2453
01:55:23,384 --> 01:55:24,551
Did I get him?

2454
01:55:24,585 --> 01:55:26,553
De Luca's got the bomb
on the helicopter. Get up!

2455
01:55:26,587 --> 01:55:27,921
Oh, fuck me!

2456
01:55:27,955 --> 01:55:29,156
I got this.

2457
01:55:36,530 --> 01:55:37,798
No!

2458
01:55:37,831 --> 01:55:39,533
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

2459
01:55:39,566 --> 01:55:40,534
Hurry up!

2460
01:55:40,567 --> 01:55:41,567
Come on!

2461
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:47,541
Kill her!

2462
01:55:48,942 --> 01:55:50,211
I've got this.
I've done this before!

2463
01:55:50,244 --> 01:55:51,244
Ah!

2464
01:55:56,117 --> 01:55:57,437
Cooper, you're gonna
fuck this up!

2465
01:55:57,751 --> 01:55:58,751
Shut up and help!

2466
01:56:04,191 --> 01:56:06,060
Are you kidding me?

2467
01:56:10,864 --> 01:56:12,099
Ford, what the hell
are you doing?

2468
01:56:12,133 --> 01:56:13,500
I'm gonna crawl up you...

2469
01:56:13,534 --> 01:56:14,601
and take out De Luca.

2470
01:56:15,902 --> 01:56:17,171
Get your hands off my boobs!

2471
01:56:17,204 --> 01:56:18,539
I'm saving you!

2472
01:56:18,572 --> 01:56:20,707
Oh, my God.
Those do not belong on those!

2473
01:56:20,741 --> 01:56:21,875
I can't get a good grip.

2474
01:56:21,908 --> 01:56:23,944
Your pants are too slippery!

2475
01:56:23,977 --> 01:56:25,779
You should have worn
coarser pants.

2476
01:56:25,812 --> 01:56:28,282
Well, I'm tired of wearing
my fucking sandpaper pants.

2477
01:56:28,315 --> 01:56:30,451
Clench your ass!
Clench your fucking ass!

2478
01:56:31,652 --> 01:56:32,886
Oh! Get out of there!

2479
01:56:32,919 --> 01:56:34,455
Help me out!

2480
01:56:34,488 --> 01:56:35,889
You motherfucker!

2481
01:56:35,922 --> 01:56:37,291
I'm gonna report you to HR.

2482
01:56:38,859 --> 01:56:40,161
Hang on tight!

2483
01:56:40,194 --> 01:56:41,995
I'm gonna swing like
I'm on a trapeze,

2484
01:56:42,029 --> 01:56:43,597
and leap my way up
to the cockpit...

2485
01:56:47,468 --> 01:56:50,504
I told you you was gonna
fuck this up, Cooper!

2486
01:56:55,042 --> 01:56:56,543
Holy smokes!

2487
01:56:57,144 --> 01:56:58,579
Ooh, that's high!

2488
01:57:05,452 --> 01:57:06,620
God damn it!

2489
01:57:08,122 --> 01:57:10,157
Fucking new suit.

2490
01:57:10,191 --> 01:57:12,025
This shit ends now!

2491
01:57:14,395 --> 01:57:15,529
Freeze!

2492
01:57:15,562 --> 01:57:16,763
Oh, my God!

2493
01:57:16,797 --> 01:57:18,599
I am not in the fucking mood
for your bullshit!

2494
01:57:18,632 --> 01:57:19,752
Yeah? Then you'll love this!

2495
01:57:22,103 --> 01:57:25,539
I am not in the mood
for your bullshit!

2496
01:57:25,572 --> 01:57:26,573
Back up!

2497
01:57:27,108 --> 01:57:28,542
Sorry, spy.

2498
01:57:28,575 --> 01:57:29,576
Playtime's over.

2499
01:57:29,610 --> 01:57:30,744
Yeah, it is.

2500
01:57:30,777 --> 01:57:31,745
Say goodbye to your toys!

2501
01:57:31,778 --> 01:57:32,946
What are you doing?

2502
01:57:32,979 --> 01:57:34,019
Don't you dare! Oh, my God!

2503
01:57:34,047 --> 01:57:35,116
Don't!

2504
01:57:36,983 --> 01:57:38,419
No!

2505
01:57:38,452 --> 01:57:39,520
Oh, my God!

2506
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:55,169
Die!

2507
01:57:55,202 --> 01:57:56,237
Ah!

2508
01:58:01,275 --> 01:58:03,344
I just shot a man!

2509
01:58:03,377 --> 01:58:05,812
Is it wrong it felt so right?

2510
01:58:05,846 --> 01:58:07,281
It's so me!

2511
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:11,385
Hey! Heroic lady!

2512
01:58:12,119 --> 01:58:13,387
In my country,

2513
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:16,089
there is a saying
about women like you...

2514
01:58:16,123 --> 01:58:17,891
"Hot as fuck!"

2515
01:58:17,924 --> 01:58:20,194
Oh, God. Not now, Aldo.

2516
01:58:20,227 --> 01:58:21,495
Go, Susan!

2517
01:58:21,762 --> 01:58:23,096
Oh.

2518
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:24,531
That was not part of my plan.

2519
01:58:27,834 --> 01:58:30,837
Just like a woman
to wear jewelry into battle.

2520
01:58:30,871 --> 01:58:32,239
Although, this is the ugliest

2521
01:58:32,273 --> 01:58:33,474
fucking necklace I've ever seen!

2522
01:58:33,507 --> 01:58:34,641
Yes, it is.

2523
01:58:34,675 --> 01:58:35,675
And it's all yours...

2524
01:58:36,243 --> 01:58:37,578
with an adjustable toggle!

2525
01:58:50,991 --> 01:58:52,659
Here we go. No problem.

2526
01:58:53,093 --> 01:58:55,128
Come on!

2527
01:58:55,162 --> 01:58:57,063
Okay! All right, I got it.

2528
01:58:57,097 --> 01:58:58,332
I got it.

2529
01:59:05,406 --> 01:59:07,040
Nice copter! Where'd you get it?

2530
01:59:07,073 --> 01:59:09,410
It's 50 Cent's!

2531
01:59:09,443 --> 01:59:11,945
I had to deputize him
to let us use it!

2532
01:59:11,978 --> 01:59:14,147
He is so afraid of me!

2533
01:59:14,181 --> 01:59:16,183
I'm a motherfucking spy!

2534
01:59:16,217 --> 01:59:17,751
Let's go shoot somebody else!

2535
01:59:17,784 --> 01:59:21,222
Simmer down, 50 Cent,
or I'll mount you again.

2536
01:59:21,255 --> 01:59:23,056
This day is just getting
better and better!

2537
01:59:23,089 --> 01:59:24,591
He wants me!

2538
01:59:25,959 --> 01:59:28,094
I think we should land.

2539
01:59:28,128 --> 01:59:30,197
I dropped a nuke in the water.

2540
01:59:44,010 --> 01:59:46,213
Good job, guys.
Sorry about the lake.

2541
01:59:46,247 --> 01:59:47,348
All right, motherfucker,
don't push.

2542
01:59:47,381 --> 01:59:48,949
You're gonna get your pictures.

2543
01:59:48,982 --> 01:59:50,317
There's enough 50 to go around.

2544
01:59:50,351 --> 01:59:51,518
You know I just helped
kill a terrorist, right?

2545
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:52,953
You ever see Kanye
do some shit like that?

2546
01:59:52,986 --> 01:59:54,355
He never, never!

2547
01:59:58,459 --> 02:00:00,394
Isn't this wonderful?

2548
02:00:00,427 --> 02:00:02,863
I was hoping to spend
the rest of my life in jail.

2549
02:00:02,896 --> 02:00:04,731
Give me some quality time
to deal with the fact...

2550
02:00:04,765 --> 02:00:06,885
that I was sleeping with
the man who killed my father.

2551
02:00:07,301 --> 02:00:08,635
Anyway. Call my lawyer.

2552
02:00:08,669 --> 02:00:09,970
Get the Goyard tote
from the hotel.

2553
02:00:10,003 --> 02:00:11,238
I need everything on time...

2554
02:00:11,272 --> 02:00:13,039
Do you think
I still work for you?

2555
02:00:13,073 --> 02:00:15,809
Whatever. Fuck you.

2556
02:00:15,842 --> 02:00:18,412
I knew you really liked me.

2557
02:00:19,580 --> 02:00:20,580
Hey!

2558
02:00:22,749 --> 02:00:24,585
Fuck you too.

2559
02:00:29,523 --> 02:00:30,991
Don't touch my fucking hair!

2560
02:00:33,327 --> 02:00:34,561
What are you looking at?

2561
02:00:39,199 --> 02:00:40,667
Oh, God, Aldo, don't...

2562
02:00:40,701 --> 02:00:43,704
I am too tired
to fend off your groping.

2563
02:00:43,737 --> 02:00:44,938
Please.

2564
02:00:44,971 --> 02:00:47,240
I understand completely.

2565
02:00:47,274 --> 02:00:51,412
Look, my real name is Albert...
MI6.

2566
02:00:51,445 --> 02:00:54,281
Look, I'm sorry if
my disguise was a bit much.

2567
02:00:54,315 --> 02:00:56,216
I just like to really
get into character.

2568
02:00:56,249 --> 02:00:58,151
Although I fear
I may have become

2569
02:00:58,184 --> 02:01:00,020
overexcited at certain points.

2570
02:01:00,053 --> 02:01:01,254
Little bit.

2571
02:01:01,288 --> 02:01:02,723
By way of apology...

2572
02:01:02,756 --> 02:01:05,626
should your work ever
bring you to London...

2573
02:01:05,659 --> 02:01:08,228
I would love
to take you for dinner.

2574
02:01:08,261 --> 02:01:10,897
Okay. Yeah,
I think that would be nice.

2575
02:01:10,931 --> 02:01:12,333
Wonderful.

2576
02:01:16,670 --> 02:01:18,071
God!

2577
02:01:18,104 --> 02:01:20,974
How you
like my English accent, huh?

2578
02:01:21,007 --> 02:01:24,345
I learn it from
the Downton Abbey.

2579
02:01:24,378 --> 02:01:26,018
No, I'm only joking.

2580
02:01:26,279 --> 02:01:27,614
Or am I?

2581
02:01:27,648 --> 02:01:28,749
Oh, my God.

2582
02:01:29,816 --> 02:01:30,816
Coop.

2583
02:01:31,151 --> 02:01:32,118
Great work.

2584
02:01:32,152 --> 02:01:33,820
What a job.

2585
02:01:33,854 --> 02:01:35,556
Super Cooper. Really amazing.

2586
02:01:35,589 --> 02:01:37,190
- Thanks.
- Yes, it was.

2587
02:01:37,223 --> 02:01:38,291
You really came through.

2588
02:01:38,325 --> 02:01:39,626
Thank you, ma'am.

2589
02:01:39,660 --> 02:01:41,027
I'd like to keep you
out in the field for now.

2590
02:01:41,227 --> 02:01:42,729
Wow.

2591
02:01:42,763 --> 02:01:44,798
We need you to fly
to Prague tomorrow...

2592
02:01:44,831 --> 02:01:47,067
to infiltrate an international
drug-smuggling ring.

2593
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:48,369
Here's your new identity.

2594
02:01:50,971 --> 02:01:51,971
You in, Cooper?

2595
02:01:53,139 --> 02:01:55,809
Agent Susan Cooper
reporting for duty, ma'am.

2596
02:01:55,842 --> 02:01:58,011
Nobody says or does that, but great.
I won't do that.

2597
02:01:58,044 --> 02:01:59,044
Okay.

2598
02:01:59,380 --> 02:02:00,781
Thank you.

2599
02:02:00,814 --> 02:02:03,116
Francis Mays is an
unemployed telemarketer

2600
02:02:03,149 --> 02:02:04,351
living off her
disability checks.

2601
02:02:04,385 --> 02:02:06,553
Oh, sweet Jesus!

2602
02:02:06,587 --> 02:02:09,155
And who wears reading glasses
in their passport photo?

2603
02:02:09,189 --> 02:02:11,291
She's only kidding. She got ya!

2604
02:02:13,226 --> 02:02:14,695
Oh, my God! That was a good one!

2605
02:02:17,230 --> 02:02:19,099
Yeah, actually, I'm not. I
don't have a sense of humor.

2606
02:02:19,132 --> 02:02:20,166
No, you don't.

2607
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:21,835
We'll talk soon.

2608
02:02:21,868 --> 02:02:24,371
Glad the pinkeye
is under control.

2609
02:02:24,405 --> 02:02:25,806
That was actually an allergy...

2610
02:02:25,839 --> 02:02:26,940
Okay. Got it.

2611
02:02:27,541 --> 02:02:28,909
So, you're a spy now, Coop.

2612
02:02:28,942 --> 02:02:29,942
Yeah.

2613
02:02:30,444 --> 02:02:31,311
Congratulations.

2614
02:02:31,344 --> 02:02:33,213
Thanks.

2615
02:02:33,246 --> 02:02:34,214
I don't think
I'll ever find anyone

2616
02:02:34,247 --> 02:02:35,447
as good as you in the basement.

2617
02:02:37,551 --> 02:02:38,885
I think you will.

2618
02:02:38,919 --> 02:02:40,554
There's a lot of good people
down there.

2619
02:02:42,723 --> 02:02:43,957
So, hey...

2620
02:02:43,990 --> 02:02:47,528
I know a great little
restaurant right near here.

2621
02:02:47,561 --> 02:02:51,932
Maybe you and I could go
for a nice, long dinner?

2622
02:02:58,805 --> 02:02:59,973
You know what,

2623
02:03:00,006 --> 02:03:02,443
I'm just kind of feeling
like a girls' night.

2624
02:03:03,309 --> 02:03:04,945
You understand, right?

2625
02:03:04,978 --> 02:03:06,913
Yeah, sure.

2626
02:03:06,947 --> 02:03:08,849
I'll catch you later.
You go have a great time.

2627
02:03:08,882 --> 02:03:09,882
Thank you.

2628
02:03:11,552 --> 02:03:13,420
You're a lot furrier
than I thought you'd be.

2629
02:03:14,054 --> 02:03:15,656
Yeah. Yeah.

2630
02:03:15,689 --> 02:03:16,990
Smell you later, pal.

2631
02:03:19,793 --> 02:03:21,962
Hey, Coop.

2632
02:03:21,995 --> 02:03:24,965
All those things you said
about me to De Luca...

2633
02:03:26,833 --> 02:03:27,833
Did you mean that?

2634
02:03:29,002 --> 02:03:30,003
God, I admire you.

2635
02:03:33,507 --> 02:03:34,941
Glad you're still
alive, Beverly,

2636
02:03:34,975 --> 02:03:36,376
you silly fucking girly wanker!

2637
02:03:36,409 --> 02:03:37,511
God!

2638
02:03:38,078 --> 02:03:39,145
Nice work, Cooper.

2639
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:42,449
Wow. Is that a compliment?

2640
02:03:42,483 --> 02:03:43,984
That's not easy for you to do.

2641
02:03:44,017 --> 02:03:45,786
Fuck it. Look, you
did a good job.

2642
02:03:45,819 --> 02:03:47,654
Probably just beginner's
luck, though.

2643
02:03:47,688 --> 02:03:50,023
There we go.
Where did you get a suit?

2644
02:03:50,056 --> 02:03:51,758
I fucking made it, didn't I?

2645
02:03:51,792 --> 02:03:53,126
It's nice.

2646
02:03:53,159 --> 02:03:54,895
You still out of the CIA?

2647
02:03:54,928 --> 02:03:56,997
Probably not. They need me.

2648
02:03:57,030 --> 02:03:59,032
I think I need to spend some
time on my own first, though.

2649
02:03:59,065 --> 02:04:00,066
Clear my head.

2650
02:04:01,367 --> 02:04:03,670
I'm gonna take this
down the coast.

2651
02:04:03,704 --> 02:04:06,006
Maybe spend some time in Italy.
Drive it to Greece.

2652
02:04:07,574 --> 02:04:09,943
Sometimes a man
needs to go to sea.

2653
02:04:10,544 --> 02:04:11,812
Sounds good, Ford.

2654
02:04:11,845 --> 02:04:12,879
Good for you.

2655
02:04:13,814 --> 02:04:14,814
Take care.

2656
02:04:15,348 --> 02:04:16,348
Bye.

2657
02:04:19,052 --> 02:04:20,687
Arrivederci.

2658
02:04:23,323 --> 02:04:24,491
Do you think
he knows that's a lake?

2659
02:04:24,525 --> 02:04:26,627
No, I don't.

2660
02:04:31,698 --> 02:04:33,634
Let's go. Okay.

2661
02:04:33,667 --> 02:04:35,836
You can't let anybody see
how sore I am.

2662
02:04:35,869 --> 02:04:36,970
I got you. Okay.

2663
02:04:37,003 --> 02:04:38,271
Come here.

2664
02:04:38,304 --> 02:04:40,406
My glutes are really seizing up.

2665
02:04:40,440 --> 02:04:42,108
If you're sore,
I'll tell you what.

2666
02:04:42,142 --> 02:04:44,044
Take a hot bath and then
we're gonna celebrate.

2667
02:04:44,077 --> 02:04:46,212
I hope you like champagne
and beef jerky.

2668
02:04:46,246 --> 02:04:48,682
Well... Oh. That's a...
You have to!

2669
02:04:48,715 --> 02:04:50,416
Because I stole a case of it...

2670
02:04:50,450 --> 02:04:51,652
I don't know
if I like them together.

2671
02:04:51,685 --> 02:04:53,787
...out of 50 Cent's helicopter!

2672
02:04:54,420 --> 02:04:56,022
Slower, slower.

2673
02:04:56,056 --> 02:04:58,224
Cooper, is this a fucking lake?

2674
02:04:59,926 --> 02:05:02,128
How the fuck do I get to Italy?

2675
02:05:10,170 --> 02:05:11,838
Ow.

2676
02:05:11,872 --> 02:05:12,872
Bosoms.

2677
02:05:20,513 --> 02:05:22,248
Ah, stop screaming.
You loved it.

2678
02:05:24,851 --> 02:05:26,252
Ugh. God.
