They began to avoid each other even when
lived in the Kremlin with other communist leaders.

107
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:17,362
There my parents have celebrated wedding.

top of him and he knew, were on his side Trosky

121
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:13,195
Trosky was the son of a prosperous landowner, which
enjoy all the privileges of wealth

122
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:22,915
And was regarded by many as a survivor

-I think we should elect one of
November the Secretariat, the Secretary-General ..

136
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:50,038
So we have a direct connection with
subsidiaries, How have you comrade Trosky

137
00:21:51,207 --> 00:21:52,518
I do not flatter myself with work, flateaza

138
00:21:53,687 --> 00:22:04,156

True!-Tov.Buharin I think is right!

143
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:48,755
No brutatitate should be allowed, although
no revolution is not possible without the terror!

144
00:22:55,927 --> 00:22:59,679
-What are you doing?

They need a kick in the ass! Come, All
what you need is a good pair of boots

152
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:50,522
Let go touch! Dad was something I
went to Tbilisi to work at a boot factory.

153
00:24:52,127 --> 00:25:00,117
Shoemaker that he wanted to be, I ran, I came
home in a couple years ... I fought like hell.

161
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:21,005
-V.Ilici?-If you are asked to send

162
00:27:22,927 --> 00:27:30,439
-It 's a copy?
-You urm.membri severely punish the Georgian Central Committee

163
00:27:30,687 --> 00:27:36,154
-Where did that? -I know they came
in a fight but slapped the man!

164
00:27:37,127 --> 00:27:43,118
-Your claims hit! - He insulted Sergo!

Sergo's to apologize!

167

E Georgian, he ... - I mean committee
Control-Who gave you the letter, who, who?

Sergo's come back Ordana immediately!
Immediately! -Com. they watch the story?

169
00:28:16,367 --> 00:28:24,403
They want to turn against me, to divide
Party! Doctors said vau to rest to be calm

170
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:31,444
Calm, so why you stressing bastards, the

But I will not allow it, I have a purpose, a mission

Dad put the party leadership Securitate. Surround
ruthless people, chosen for loyalty to him.

-Who arranged that? -Myself!

00:29:23,127 --> 00:29:25,277
-Make sure!

-And Trosky is about to become a
-Lenin Of course not listen to another opinion

180
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:45,670
Yours in particular-Not even our Perera

- Healthy, strong, able to solve our problems
difficult! - November, we could manage! -In the spirit!

182
00:29:55,447 --> 00:29:59,438
-November???

184
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:20,645
-Yes, that can not stay on 1 or 2
-Okay, okay

185
00:30:29,807 --> 00:30:33,685
-What make way now?
-Let me take stupid!

186
00:30:55,847 --> 00:31:03,920
-Trosky, comrade Lenin wants to see, said to be
to stand up against Stalin's not too late.

187
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:04,358
Nothing, ma'am. A little indigestion.

188
00:31:04,047 --> 00:31:10,360
- We must help the
Lenin now! -Hands!

189
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:17,835
-Where is it?
-Do not be upset!

190
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:35,725
What fai?
-I read some of my essays!

191
00:31:38,887 --> 00:31:47,205
-They went again to f.interesant

192
00:31:51,127 --> 00:31:57,957
-I made? -Yes! ... Read
official reports ... -Doctors say ...

193
00:31:58,447 --> 00:32:08,243
-Answers to your face, make it about you
And organizational, yes ... but doctors say

194
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:21,118
-It was not tired
-Do not get tired, reading: reports, newspaper

195
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:31,376
-Newspapers? -Yes real newspapers, not paperwork
they have chosen you for me

196
00:32:31,377 --> 00:32:34,482
-Not one scrap for Lenin
cribs full of good news

197
00:32:36,687 --> 00:32:42,246
-You raised money just to get you out of policy?
-It will help healing

198
00:32:42,914 --> 00:32:47,795
-Nooo, I are out policy!
-No!

199
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:56,798
-So you do not know what's happening in the country, n
I allowed to read their own newspapers

200
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:06,531
Leave it to your comrade Lenin read
fairy tale that abureli that damned abureli

201
00:33:06,847 --> 00:33:14,484
It's not that you do well, we need you,
for your healing, leadership comrade. Lenin

202
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:25,804
How comrade. Lenin lead ...
if you is denied access to information

203
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:35,083
- It will help ... doctors orders
- Doctorileor orders? -Yes

204
00:33:37,247 --> 00:33:42,635
-Not Stalin's orders? -NO-situation
in Georgia, you're georgiaan, you ...

205
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:49,037
-One should not be
worry! I help

206
00:34:04,967 --> 00:34:10,763
-Why did you call Troska, crazy bitch,
I think that to know ... what you want, kill him?

207
00:34:59,607 --> 00:35:01,995
-Lenin is dead!

208
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:16,317
Intelesm Dad, how much they complain
Russians new god, now that religion was illegal

209
00:35:16,487 --> 00:35:22,559
Was the idea of him smelling the
Lenin put him in Red Square to the

210
00:35:31,727 --> 00:35:39,197
-Com. Molotov, where e Com. Trosky? Parca had to
sal find him and bring there, what happened?

211
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:47,483
-I found ... I said to imormantarea
was yesterday but was too far to reach

212
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:56,924
-You lied, why? -You
said he did not want him here!

213
00:35:59,087 --> 00:36:02,158
-Not one to admit this to anyone it or not?
-Yes

214
00:36:04,327 --> 00:36:13,524
-Then why are you telling me? You
some Molotov to reach a far

215
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:45,720
Leaving us, comrade. Lenin ordered us
inaintre to look and be pure

216
00:36:48,927 --> 00:36:54,440
A major requirement for the party
Leaving our comrade. Lenin urges us

217
00:36:54,607 --> 00:37:01,359
To remain united: Party!

218
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:10,484
Together swear to it
honor the word! Tov.Lenin!

219
00:37:22,647 --> 00:37:24,955
I had a quarrel in the morning
-About what?

220
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:29,515
-Nikolai!
-What, like I like?

221
00:37:30,687 --> 00:37:34,519
-Nikolai, I
offered a job at a new magazine: Culture and Revolution!

222
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:40,315
Joseph, said that next. thing that I will waste
time are some peasants as a useless poets

223
00:37:40,487 --> 00:37:43,726
-And you said are useless? -I said no
are useless-I said it is far from useless

224
00:37:44,727 --> 00:37:50,105
-Russia cultural needs-exactly-then
I put my arms around him and apologized!

225
00:37:52,106 --> 00:37:55,213
-Then you make love

226
00:37:58,214 --> 00:38:05,939
It's a terrible thing like the death of Lenin,
That it happens now, who will lead?

227
00:38:07,974 --> 00:38:11,639
-Joseph said the strain on the back or
-Who?

228
00:38:14,647 --> 00:38:17,641
-Time to incepem.Sena!

229
00:38:47,642 --> 00:38:51,247
-Yes
--

230
00:39:13,248 --> 00:39:21,761
Charming flowers, their life is too small
-What happened?

231
00:39:23,927 --> 00:39:28,394
-Phone, call ... they found a letter
What letter???

232
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:33,844
A letter which Lenin trimiso the Committee
center to be opened after his death!

233
00:39:34,607 --> 00:39:39,925
What say? -I know nothing
about it? -No, nothing?

234
00:39:40,287 --> 00:39:44,641
Working with Lenin's nearest you, you have
heard anyone speak about it!

235
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:51,799
-Lie?
-They do not know anything about it!

236
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:07,561
He reached bitch: Trosky
You called success!

237
00:40:08,727 --> 00:40:16,004
Trosky, Karmaniev, Zinoviev
Those, 3 small kids

238
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:19,680
-Do not say that!
-Mice!

239
00:40:19,847 --> 00:40:23,409
If the committee is Georgian
an understanding with them, then ...

240
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:39,714
Com. Lenin also wrote: Stalin is too
brutal and these become intolerable

241
00:40:40,823 --> 00:40:47,442
From one that has the function of
Secretary General therefore proposed comrade

242
00:40:47,607 --> 00:40:54,555
To consider the removal of Stalin
ac.pozitie and the appointment of another person

243
00:40:55,556 --> 00:41:01,643
May patient, more loyal, more
caring and less ...

244
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:10,320
Trosky Tro .. ... .. sky instead Trosky
Stalin to be Trosky, talk!

245
00:41:10,687 --> 00:41:14,474
-Do it, you only can we get rid of
Stalin! -It 's too stupid to know what to do

246
00:41:17,647 --> 00:41:25,682
Please, please! For each one of us cuv.lui
Lenin had a purpose and a different meaning!

247
00:41:26,847 --> 00:41:31,201
But in the period in which comrade. Lenin did not
could lead fell per new actions. task!

248
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:38,355
Com. Kazemiev, Zenovia and Stalin
to provide collective leadership!

249
00:41:38,527 --> 00:41:43,404
Our experience makes me happy to
I say: The statement comrade. Lenin is wrong

250
00:41:44,567 --> 00:41:49,841
So aim to keep it on Stalin
the item or-This is outrageous

251
00:41:51,114 --> 00:41:57,157
-Lenin was sick! -Lenin was right,
should listen to him talk Trosky

252
00:41:59,527 --> 00:42:02,357
-To say that Lenin had
right-betrayed you!

253
00:42:02,527 --> 00:42:11,882
Yes, comrades are cruel to those who hate
party, I hid it and not hide it now

254
00:42:13,527 --> 00:42:23,438
It's good to be kind, but you must know when
I am free to be cruel to keep my job

255
00:42:25,607 --> 00:42:32,676
The 2 times I tried to quit and 2
times I was told to rasman the current position.

256
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:42,956
I obey the party's obligation
me to stay on my position.

257
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:05,645
Trosky has wasted the last chance to stop
underestimated the human father that you consider a donkey

258
00:43:23,087 --> 00:43:26,283
-I am James!

259
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:39,063
-Your son!
-I know!

260
00:43:43,064 --> 00:43:46,218
-What are you doing here?
Came to Moscow to study!

261
00:43:46,607 --> 00:43:54,404
-It is better here in Tbilisi, I mean schools
-think you can come here without me???

262
00:43:56,933 --> 00:44:02,298
-Get out, go, outside, go
-I gave your son a camera

263
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:24,974
-No, no, no, do not worry, it will be fine!

264
00:44:27,975 --> 00:44:36,078
"Why Joseph? Why? I never
You said you were a child, why?

265
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,085
When his mother had died 2 months, not
have you seen since then, why?

266
00:44:46,086 --> 00:44:51,840
You hated it? -Don 'You Baby?
-He was a young woman georgian

267
00:44:51,987 --> 00:44:54,964
-Uneducated, religious ...
-So do you love?

268
00:44:56,047 --> 00:45:00,479
-She was young, I was young
-Not even talked about it!

269
00:45:05,087 --> 00:45:08,761
-Nadia's dead!
-Yeah, the door is closed, the room is sealed?

270
00:45:09,927 --> 00:45:12,724
-And you do not ever think to
it? Voldemort is dead-And if I die?

271
00:45:13,887 --> 00:45:17,036
-Do not say that-If you die,
Vasily abandon him?

272
00:45:17,207 --> 00:45:20,640
-I 've abandoned
James, I left with his sisters

273
00:45:20,807 --> 00:45:23,640
-Who has a
Vasily let him?

274
00:45:24,807 --> 00:45:27,604
-Get your
mind-n cap!

275
00:45:54,767 --> 00:46:00,165
-Another child?
What child?

276
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:05,442
-The port that you are pregnant!

277
00:46:10,607 --> 00:46:14,358
-Are you pregnant?

278
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:25,100
-Why did not you say, the
what? -I should, but ...

279
00:46:37,036 --> 00:46:39,436
Leave it to James to stay!

280
00:47:19,607 --> 00:47:21,643
Joseph???

281
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:36,718
-Look
conspirand at them? E Trosky vs me, me vs. Trosky

282
00:47:39,887 --> 00:47:44,640
-I guess I get to
top ... You attack me first

283
00:47:58,807 --> 00:48:03,762
-Comrades, do not
I let them do that, friend of Lenin's Trosky

284
00:48:03,927 --> 00:48:07,757

To have a discussion: to say to you

Say ... you hold a prisoner with inside information
vital that your master can save lives ...

291
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:07,802
It's stubborn, does not want to

-Temporary maneuver!

301
00:51:52,127 --> 00:51:56,880
Sergo, I guess you could ...

302
00:52:00,047 --> 00:52:02,721
Maybe you could persuade the members
Congress to get rid of: Zinobie

303
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:08,763
Find a replacement! A Communist

00:54:56,887 --> 00:54:59,958
10 feet who could believe this?

320
00:55:01,127 --> 00:55:05,720
You have to admire a man like
this, and to supervise

321
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:12,196
Go to Leningrad and be watching
they. The customized on it, especially the Kirov

322
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:30,164
My parents, my brother Vasily and I,
was on my way south to house winter

323
00:55:32,327 --> 00:55:37,237
And stopped in every state, the father can
muscles show party local authorities

327
00:56:22,967 --> 00:56:27,605
-Yields have been good ... I
fields seen from the train

328
00:56:25,327 --> 00:57:04,601
-The state required peasants to work for the good townspeople!
-There is trouble in my district!

329
00:56:29,767 --> 00:56:32,520
-But grain is not delivered, why?

330
00:56:34,687 --> 00:56:39,823
-That 's because the peasants were told that
if prices are expected to get better

331
00:56:39,924 --> 00:56:48,281
To become rich at the expense
others who he said that, who?

332
00:56:49,282 --> 00:56:56,164
-Com. Stalin, I'm not sure that you understand the situation!
-The state offers low prices, unreasonable!

333
00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:13,439
Party officials do not understand
peasantry, come to villages threatening

334
00:57:14,607 --> 00:57:18,645
Peasants complain that the then NDA Buy
grain not receive anything in return!

335
00:57:19,807 --> 00:57:22,603
-There is nothing for them to buy!

336
00:57:23,767 --> 00:57:30,041
I asked, what to do and I
You gave answers? NOT only complaints

337
00:57:31,207 --> 00:57:37,562
You gave me a solution, not
so I give you a mine:

338
00:57:39,727 --> 00:57:45,160
You will begin selling all provisory
Wheat in existing ppreturile

339
00:57:46,327 --> 00:57:48,317
Whoever refuses, it will
be confiscated grain!

340
00:57:51,727 --> 00:57:56,082
-You bring everyone you poune in
before the law based on art.107 of the Penal Code

341

Thanks for your ideas!

344
00:58:30,927 --> 00:58:38,156
80% of the population were farmers who lived in
remote areas and isolated from the control of the party

345
00:58:39,327 --> 00:58:42,318
For dad, it
represent a real danger

346
00:58:42,487 --> 00:58:45,239
Those that could not control them
could later become foes

347
00:58:52,367 --> 00:58:57,156
And you could cut your throat when you
barbiere are, or you drown in a pit.

348
00:58:58,927 --> 00:59:00,599
-I have children, understand me!
-Comrade, please!

349
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:34,279

-It 's a pervert!
-Beria?

352
00:59:56,327 --> 01:00:01,399
-Sergo, met in Georgia, even
before becoming party chief

353
01:00:02,567 --> 01:00:08,638
He kidnapped a girl, one raped her,
forced her to marry him

354
01:00:16,327 --> 01:00:22,159
Lead by around one ever sees
she loves and says: Bring thio here!

355
01:00:23,327 --> 01:00:27,114
Then he says: "If you do not want to be
something happen to you or your family ... "

356
01:00:33,287 --> 01:00:37,437
-Sergo, he hates! -Why not
Joseph says something? -He said

357
01:00:39,607 --> 01:00:43,562
-And your husband said, "See
your own business "just

358
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,717
A talk I with him

359
01:00:52,887 --> 01:00:57,674
-Declare war on the peasants, forcing them
to give up their own land

360
01:00:57,647 --> 01:01:05,160
And collective farms to move to state
Already they hoard seeds you go

01:01:06,327 --> 01:01:10,318
-There will be famine!
-Bukharin're too bland!

362
01:01:11,318 --> 01:01:19,961
-There are reports that some villagers have been shot,
without trial, thousands are sent to LAGRA: Why?

363
01:01:22,127 --> 01:01:27,764
You have to starve to feed the country for
cities? Politburo's never agree

364
01:01:28,927 --> 01:01:39,316
-I know everyone's position
-But Lenin, Lenin always said that the party must debate

365
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:44,919
-Do not try to
bring him to Lenin in Lenin that Bukharin guy

366
01:01:56,207 --> 01:02:00,040
-I 'm going back to Moscow

367
01:02:27,807 --> 01:02:35,162
What happens to Nikolai?
-Joseph not to stand against anyone cushion

368
01:02:38,327 --> 01:02:45,921
-As you know Trosky sent into exile not forgive, not
Remember, Sena does not trust anyone, not even Sergei

369

Sergi, mine? The oldest
Friend, you imaginzi things

370
01:02:53,487 --> 01:03:00,115
He hates his own son: James, you humiliate, not

378
01:04:42,887 --> 01:04:45,878
-Bring a doctor, fetch a doctor and take
Vasily it on here

379
01:04:59,047 --> 01:05:03,435
-Stupid, not even to shoot
I able

380
01:05:38,607 --> 01:05:41,315
James survived, but
my mother's soul was hurt

381
01:06:24,327 --> 01:06:42,365
-Nadia? What is in

-We become stronger, hell
Our enemies can not accept something

599
01:54:00,367 --> 01:54:06,324
Enemy agents infiltrated everywhere, including on
high position, doing its best to destroy our economy

600
01:54:07,247 --> 01:54:12,239
And wanted to pursue it after

a rope, Bukharin trusts you

604
01:54:34,567 --> 01:54:40,919
A davada of your friendship by Stalin
State proves your loyalty

605
01:54:46,647 --> 01:54:55,080
-You want me to renounce the Bukharin, as you can judge him
and shoot him, why go through all this?

606
01:54:56,047 --> 01:55:02,322

Sergo brother confessed to you, you gave
order as Commissioner of heavy industry

613
01:55:43,567 --> 01:55:48,764
For acts of sabotage
and smuggling is a fact

614
01:55:49,927 --> 01:55:56,884
-My brother confessed?
-I have to admit, there have been too many accidents, too many

615
01:55:58,047 --> 01:56:06,799
You let my brother being beaten, tortured,
Bring him to Moscow, I want to see you both!

German crossed the border with Austria

We are united in a patriotic war against
an enemy that trying to make people

02:20:44,567 --> 02:20:49,559
To defeat, to despair

He heard of some people
And turned against me

820
02:38:35,527 --> 02:38:36,957
He became my enemy

821
02:38:41,327 --> 02:38:45,285
And then I betrayed Suicide

822

You asked ... why Beria expected to call one days until the doctor?

841
02:43:47,767 --> 02:43:50,123
-If m
I asked?

842
02:43:51,287 --> 02:43:57,117
-We try to take power

What crimes?
-Millions ...

847
02:44:27,007 --> 02:44:32,521
-Nikita, you're too sentimental, talking too much, who are we to
judge him by Stalin?

848
02:44:33,687 --> 02:44:37,361
-Without it we would have a Tier 2 country, now look
at us

849
02:44:37,527 --> 02:44:42,757
Controlled half of Europe, all
China, We have the atomic bomb

850
02:44:43,927 --> 02:44:48,919
Order will be honored without
Stalin We would have taken 20 years plus

Without Stalin, I could be a big country

854
02:45:06,047 --> 02:45:09,675
-How to History asked Stalin?

855
02:45:50,847 --> 02:45:55,236
-Dad? Dad?

856

-Stop

857
02:46:51,127 --> 02:46:54,165
Without you all the tar is lost

858
02:47:27,327 --> 02:47:33,515
At 3 months after the death of Stalin, Lavrenty
Beria was executed by his former associates

859
02:47:35,087 --> 02:47:40,036
3 years later, Nikita Khrushchev began the public
to reveal the nature and extent of Stalin's crimes

860
02:47:55,487 --> 02:48:01,843
Svetlana Alliluyeva is alive
and lives in England (1992)

861
02:48:38,007 --> 02:48:49,566
Iosiv Stalin's crimes have caused the deaths of tens of
