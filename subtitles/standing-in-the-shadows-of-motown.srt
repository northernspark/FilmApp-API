00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:16,605
Berry Gordy started Tamla Records- later
known as the Motown Record Corporation-

3
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:21,510
with an $800 loan from
a family co-operative in january 1959.

4
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:36,785
Berry Gordy relied on joe Hunter
to bring talent to Motown.

5
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:09,124
At the time of filming,
Joe was indeed still playing...

6
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:14,531
albeit in obscurity, in a Marriott
Hotel lobby in Troy, Michigan.

7
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:10,219
The music heard is The Funk Brothers'
stage theme song, "The Flick. "

8
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:15,283
They recorded several versions
in the fall of 1965.

9
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,184
The Hula Hoop was introduced
by Wham-O Manufacturing in 1958.

10
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:25,458
Rightfielder Al Kaline was the Detroit
Tigers premiere player in the '50s.

11
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,369
Singer Billie Holiday was known as "Lady
Day," a great favorite of Berry Gordy.

12
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:37,466
He would later produce a film on her
life starring Motown artist Diana Ross.

13
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:53,549
Before Motown, Berry Gordy was a
successful songwriter forjackie Wilson.

14
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,938
Gerald Levert performs
"Reach Out I'll Be There,"

15
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:44,507
originally a number one
hit for the Four Tops.

16
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:53,474
The Funk Brothers recorded the
original backing track on july 8, 1966.

17
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:05,621
An astounding track, "Reach Out"
illustrates james jamerson's...

18
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:10,692
fully developed 16th-note
syncopated bass style.

19
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:19,067
Jamerson took a standard, root-fifth,
cocktail approach to his bass part...

20
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:23,638
and ran it through
countless rhythmic variations.

21
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:31,420
Gerald Levert is the son of
Eddie Levert, lead singer of the O'jays.

22
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,757
He was born the year
"Reach Out" was a hit.

23
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,716
The song's percussion
hook was played by a Funk

24
00:06:42,717 --> 00:06:46,101
Brother thumping the head of
a "bell-less" tambourine...

25
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,943
while its memorable
piccolo part is re-created

26
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:51,507
on stage by its
originator, Dayna Hartwick.

27
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,564
This sequence was filmed at
the Encore record store on

28
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:16,624
the University of Michigan
campus in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

29
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:26,308
The people interviewed are
actual store customers, not actors.

30
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:35,396
Paul Riser was classically
trained. He is best known

31
00:08:35,397 --> 00:08:38,047
as an arranger of hits like
"My Girl," among others.

32
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:50,889
Grammy winner Stevejordan
worked with Bootsy Collins in the film.

33
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:58,127
<i>He got his break as the drummer
on Late Night with David Letterman.</i>

34
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,408
<i>Songwriter Edward Holland
began his career as</i>

35
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:07,507
a singer, best known for
his 1962 hit, "jamie. "

36
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:10,210
Detroit native Don Was
covered the Temptations' "Papa

37
00:09:10,211 --> 00:09:12,710
Was A Rollin' Stone" with
the group, Was (Not Was).

38
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:15,753
As a young musician, he gigged
with Funk Brother "Pistol" Allen.

39
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,641
<i>In 1962, Martha Reeves was
discovered at the 20 Grand</i>

40
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:41,273
nightclub by Motown's A&R
head, Mickey Stevenson.

41
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:47,413
She worked as his secretary
before signing as a singer.

42
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,787
Therefore, she was one of the few Motown
artists to interact with the musicians.

Joan Osborne sings
"(Love Is Like A) Heatwave... "

46
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,431
originally a number four hit for Martha

47
00:10:58,432 --> 00:11:01,519
& The Vandellas in the summer of 1963.

48
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:30,014
The Funk Brothers recorded its
original backing track with producers...

49
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:34,456
<i>Brian Holland and Lamont Dozier
on june 20, 1963.</i>

50
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,842
<i>Joan Osborne released
How Sweet It Is, an</i>

51
00:11:56,843 --> 00:11:59,642
entire album of R&B classics, in 2002.

52
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:14,865
Tom Scott plays here; Mike Terry, who blew
many such classic sax breaks for Motown...

53
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:18,733
played on the original recording.

54
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,864
By '63, Motown's chief
technician Mike McLean

55
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:31,939
had installed a handmade,
three-track tape deck.

56
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:37,309
Now, lead vocals were
overdubbed, and the Funks would

57
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:40,686
record not knowing for whom
their tracks were intended.

58
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:48,082
For "Heatwave," the Vandellas
recorded vocals on the

59
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,459
same day as the Funks, but
at a session later in the day.

60
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,801
In 1955, Black Detroiters
had the highest per

61
00:13:11,802 --> 00:13:14,823
capita income among African
Americans nationwide.

62
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,162
Yet at that time,
African Americans earned

63
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:22,392
about 33 cents to every
dollar earned by whites.

64
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,334
The Bel-Aire was
the most popular Chevy in the 1950s.

65
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:35,844
Joe Hunter worked a drill press
at Chevrolet outside Detroit...

66
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:40,749
after an Army stint with Earl Van
Dyke at the Lockburn base in Ohio.

67
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:05,276
Baker's, located at the intersection of
8 Mile Road and Livernois...

68
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:08,869
has been a Detroit jazz institution
for over 50 years.

69
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:34,338
Berry Gordy hung the sign
"Hitsville U.S.A." on his house...

70
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,900
<i>at 2648 West Grand Boulevard
before Motown had any hits.</i>

71
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:46,248
Motown used to store master tapes
in Smokey's basement...

72
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:50,812
until flooding forced Motown
to set up a tape library at Hitsville.

73
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:05,994
Jamerson was told to play the bass
because he had big hands.

74
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,838
<i>Jamerson got his first
and only upright bass</i>

75
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,624
for about $200 after
graduating from high school.

76
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:59,047
Jamerson switched to
electric Fender bass in 1961.

77
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,508
Jamerson jr. had a hit band
on his own, Chanson...

78
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:24,105
whose "Don't Hold Back"
was a Top 10 R&B smash in 1978.

79
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:40,592
Jamerson only changed his strings if
they broke. He used LaBella flat wounds-

80
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:46,001
a "dead" sound with a heavy bottom,
a challenge for Motown's engineers.

81
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:32,412
Jamerson's bass and all the
guitarists were plugged directly

82
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:35,476
into the mix board via the
gray box with meters on it.

83
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:39,489
It is located just to the lower left
of the control booth window.

84
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,768
Hitsville U.S.A. is now the
site of the Motown Historical

85
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:16,123
Museum, run by Ms. Esther
Edwards, Berry Gordy's sister.

86
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:26,627
Though thought of as a basement, Hitsville's
studio was actually a converted garage.

87
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:31,539
The actual underground basement
was home to the engineering staff.

88
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:44,273
The studio's nickname,
"Snakepit," derived from

89
00:18:44,274 --> 00:18:47,314
the microphone cables
suspended from the ceiling.

90
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:02,113
The control room, seen
behind the glass, had

91
00:19:02,114 --> 00:19:04,673
six monitors blasting
both day and night.

92
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:09,236
The cabinets were custom-built
by the Gordy family's construction crew.

93
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,361
Everyone pitched in at
Motown: In the early days,

94
00:19:25,362 --> 00:19:28,222
Smokey Robinson was responsible
for cleaning Studio A.

95
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,785
A key to the Motown Sound was nothing
ever moved, especially the drums.

96
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:54,848
The vibes arejack Ashford's original
Deegan Imperial Nocturne model.

97
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,761
The real piano, however,
is in Berry Gordy's house.

98
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,444
Meshell performs The Miracles'
"You've Really Got A Hold On Me. "

99
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:55,748
<i>The original track was cut October 16,
1962, and hit the Top 10 a few months later.</i>

100
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:24,472
None of the musicians used headphones
during their original sessions.

101
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,870
The guitarists crowded
around a monitor (seen behind

102
00:21:33,871 --> 00:21:37,218
Eddie Willis) and were
responsible for their own volume.

103
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:49,070
Smokey wrote
"You Really Got A Hold On Me"...

104
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:52,143
a homage to Sam Cooke's
"Bring It On Home To Me. "

105
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,383
The horns are playing live

106
00:22:07,384 --> 00:22:09,452
they're just off camera, in

107
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,019
Motown's original isolation booth.

108
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:03,403
Meshell was the first woman to be
honored as "Bassist of the Year," in 1994.

109
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,435
Jack Ashford stands 6'
5", but he still gets

110
00:23:12,436 --> 00:23:15,153
teased for having the
world's largest tambourine.

111
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,471
Marvin Gaye started singing with

112
00:23:29,472 --> 00:23:31,832
The Rainbows in Washington D.C. ...

113
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:37,904
and Harvey Fuqua's Moonglows in the "50s.
He first worked at Motown as a drummer.

114
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,696
Joe had been retired for
30 years but was convinced,

115
00:24:03,697 --> 00:24:06,433
for this film, to take
out his guitar again.

116
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:24,651
Riser is being modest here:
he was a terrific trombone player.

117
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,643
Quick look: a rare
shot of the Temptations'

118
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,675
David Ruffin without his
trademark black glasses.

119
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,358
Benny Benjamin and joe
Hunter were in their

120
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:25,946
mid-thirties when they
started the Motown band.

121
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:49,236
<i>The Funks recorded the session
Joe's referring to on june 3, 1962.</i>

122
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:54,307
Berry Gordy sang the demo
for The Contours.

123
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:37,523
<i>"Do You Love Me?"
originally hit number three in '62...</i>

124
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:42,589
<i>and returned to the charts when featured
in the hit film Dirty Dancing in 1988.</i>

125
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,998
Bootsy is an influential
and innovative bassist

126
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:50,805
who was heavily influenced
byjames jamerson.

127
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,051
Bootsy admits he could
never play likejamerson, so

128
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:18,233
he developed his own unique,
"liquid funk" style...

129
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:20,198
as heard on james Brown's "Sex Machine,"

130
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:22,432
several P-Funk classics
and with his own band.

131
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,041
Berry Gordy originally turned down The

132
00:27:58,042 --> 00:27:59,112
Contours. jackie Wilson

133
00:27:59,113 --> 00:28:00,368
spoke up on their behalf.

134
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:47,914
Wilson was shot by his girlfriend in front
of his NYC apartment February 15, 1961.

135
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,449
<i>Because of his injuries,
Wilson could only handle</i>

136
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,690
three shows a week. The
Funks made $25 per show.

137
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,723
However, their expenses were
$60 a week, leaving them with

138
00:28:55,724 --> 00:28:58,599
only $15 profit. They were
better off in the "Snakepit. "

139
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:36,908
On the road,james jamerson
spent the better part of his

140
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:39,966
time searching for soul food.
Hotel food made him grouchy.

141
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:05,495
Jamerson liked odd food concoctions
like raccoon and possum gumbo.

142
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:27,016
Pig's feet are considered a Chinese
delicacy and are eaten for good luck.

143
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:46,832
The music heard here is,
"The Way You Do The Things You Do. "

144
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,828
Smokey Robinson and
fellow Miracle Bobby Rogers

145
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:52,899
wrote it in a similar
station wagon while on tour.

146
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:40,183
Blues singerjoe Weaver
was Benny's first cousin.

147
00:32:40,184 --> 00:32:43,458
Pre-Motown, The Funk Brothers
often backed him live.

148
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:09,075
Corn liquor, aka "moonshine,"
is also called "panther's breath... "

149
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:14,454
"ruckus juice," "hillbilly pop"
and "white lightning. "

150
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:28,232
<i>The "Hitch Hike" session was on September
16, 1962. The producer was Mickey Stevenson.</i>

151
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:44,210
Uriel's nickname was "Possum. "

152
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,107
"Pistol" is sitting at
his original drum set,

153
00:34:20,108 --> 00:34:22,953
still in that exact spot
at the Motown Museum.

154
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:07,093
At that time, "Funk" is lowdown, nasty
- a word not used in everyday conversation.

155
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,869
When the band had
an album released in '64...

156
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:18,142
Berry Gordy changed the name of the group
to Earl Van Dyke & The Soul Brothers.

157
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:32,424
Jr. Walker & The All Stars' original
"Shotgun" was recorded December 15, 1964.

158
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:57,150
While the song stemmed from
Jr. 's regular club dates...

159
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:02,818
The Funk Brothers, not The All Stars,
recorded his Motown hit.

160
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:07,557
It reached number four
on the Pop charts.

161
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:37,951
Jr. Walker played a Selmer saxophone,
but retired the original in the '80s.

162
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:41,930
His style influenced dozens
of later players like Tom Scott.

163
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:05,069
The original version's
signature intro resulted

164
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:08,388
from Eddie Willis accidentally
kicking a reverb tank.

165
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,683
Johnny Griffith recorded for Motown's
short-lived Workshopjazz label.

166
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:44,744
<i>His album, "jazz," received a four-star
review from Downbeat in May 1963.</i>

167
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:07,138
Mickey Stevenson is
surrounded by Jamerson (left),

168
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:09,568
his wife and singer Kim
Weston and jack Ashford.

169
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:33,226
"Pride And joy" features some ofjoe
Hunter's best piano playing at Motown.

170
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:38,798
<i>The session they're discussing was
recorded midweek, September 12, 1962.</i>

171
00:39:56,927 --> 00:40:01,387
Joe had been gigging
with Hank Ballard & The Midnighters...

172
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:06,960
when he took a gamble to go with
Berry Gordy's new record venture in '58.

173
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:23,279
Joe describes himself as a "down-home
boogie woogie" piano player.

174
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,195
Ethel Waters first popularized "Stormy

175
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:35,530
Weather" in 1933, when
joe was a very young boy.

176
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:50,196
Lottie was originally a Lindy Hop dancer
in New York in the late "40s.

177
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:54,770
Soul singer Solomon Burke says she
was "the first naked woman I ever saw

178
00:41:54,771 --> 00:41:55,870
- with a snake. "

179
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,656
The two versions of
"I Heard It Through The

180
00:42:43,657 --> 00:42:46,688
Grapevine," inspired
by Lottie's rhythms...

181
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:52,099
were recorded four months apart
in 1967- Marvin Gaye's was cut first.

182
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:01,670
<i>They're standing on 12th
Street, where the '67</i>

183
00:43:01,671 --> 00:43:04,737
riots began. It's now known
as Rosa Parks Boulevard.

184
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:11,686
Martha jean "The Queen" Steinberg,
a blues Dj on Wj LB...

185
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:17,227
would routinely broadcast
The Funk Brothers' jam sessions...

186
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:21,788
at the Chit Chat during
the glory days of the 1960s.

187
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:47,933
Motown producerjohnny Bristol said
The Funk Brothers "breathed together. "

188
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:50,998
He once recalled a session
where one of the guys went

189
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:54,006
out to get a sandwich, came
back five minutes later...

190
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:59,249
and fell back into the groove
as if he'd never left.

191
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:44,259
<i>The Funk Brothers are
re-creating the original</i>

192
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:47,326
session recorded at Hitsville
on September 28, 1965.

193
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:50,361
Producer Norman Whitfield
had written it as "Please

194
00:46:50,362 --> 00:46:53,398
Don't Leave Me Girl" and
intended it for Marvin Gaye.

195
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:45,267
With new lyrics by Eddie
Holland, "Ain't Too Proud To

196
00:47:45,268 --> 00:47:48,220
Beg" by the Temptations
reached number four in 1966.

197
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:15,275
Kasuku Mafia, an original
member of the Motown

198
00:49:15,276 --> 00:49:18,377
horn section, re-creates
his solo from the record.

199
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:46,649
Ben Harper also covered Marvin Gaye's
only non-Motown hit, "Sexual Healing. "

200
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:22,290
Motown engineering graduated
to eight-track recording

201
00:50:22,291 --> 00:50:25,377
in january 1965, using
hand-built machines that opened...

202
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:28,504
the sonic spectrum and allowed room for

203
00:50:28,505 --> 00:50:31,519
the sophisticated arrangements cited.

204
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:50,235
Earl Van Dyke joined in '63 and evolved
into the bandleader a year later.

205
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:14,493
He was called not only "Big Funk,"
but "Ookie" and "Chunk of Funk. "

206
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:24,409
Earl's exceptional
jazz-soul organ chops...

207
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:27,648
<i>can be heard on saxophonist
Fred jackson's rare</i>

208
00:51:27,649 --> 00:51:30,475
Blue Note album from
1963, Hootin' 'N Tootin.

209
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:45,142
Berry Gordy instructed
The Funk Brothers to teach

210
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:47,895
young Stevie Wonder how
to play piano and drums.

211
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:50,732
The lessons would often
turn comical, leaving Stevie

212
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:53,306
locked in a closet after
a game of Hide-And-Seek.

213
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:07,449
<i>Earl died of prostate cancer
on September 19, 1992.</i>

214
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:22,888
Uriel, like Berry Gordy,
was a young boxer.

215
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:27,959
Elsewhere in the Snakepit, Robert White
was an expert martial artist.

216
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:11,368
PAC-3, United and Golden
World were all Detroit

217
00:54:11,369 --> 00:54:14,439
studios located within a
few minutes of Hitsville.

218
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:30,956
The "few bucks" Eddie mentions rose from
an initial $5 per track in late "59...

219
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:35,697
<i>to the union scale of $52.50
per three-hour session in 1964.</i>

220
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:53,979
<i>Johnny's extra $100 a week then translates
to more than $500 a week in 2002 dollars.</i>

221
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:08,348
Most of the Funks were
salaried employees earning a

222
00:55:08,349 --> 00:55:11,329
steady income they could
augment with outside gigs.

223
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:16,743
Jamerson eventually made close to
$100,000 a year in the late '60s.

224
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:48,357
Bootsy performs "Cooljerk,"
originally a hit for Detroit

225
00:56:48,358 --> 00:56:51,363
group The Capitols. It was a
Top 10 smash in spring 1966.

226
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,376
The original "Cooljerk" session
was one of the last cut at

227
00:57:13,377 --> 00:57:16,490
Golden World Studios, just before
its purchase by Berry Gordy.

228
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:21,127
Golden World was to
become Motown's "Studio B."

229
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,504
Johnny Griffith, Eddie
Willis and Bob Babbitt

230
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:49,159
re-create their original
parts from the record.

231
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:52,475
The original session also
included saxophonist Mike

232
00:57:52,476 --> 00:57:55,500
Terry and future Motown
guitarist Dennis Coffey.

233
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:04,239
<i>Between 1962 and 1975, 75 percent of
all Motown releases made the Pop charts.</i>

234
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:09,972
In December '68, Motown held
the top three spots for four weeks.

235
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:33,558
<i>The Tamla-Motown UK tour ran
from March 20 through April 12, 1965.</i>

236
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:36,905
The Funks not only
backed the stars, they

237
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:40,371
were billed as "The
Earl Van Dyke Sextet"...

238
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:45,971
and had two instrumental singles already in
the market: "All For You" and "Soul Stomp. "

239
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:06,958
The Beatles also paid Motown homage by
having Mary Wells open their '64 UK tour.

240
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:10,631
Motown's Brenda Holloway
opened dates on their '65 U.S. tour.

241
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:03,038
Earl Van Dyke remembers
Smokey pushing for more than 40

242
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:05,688
takes of"The Tears Of A Clown.
" Take nine became the hit.

243
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:26,405
The Funks created the hit track for

244
01:01:26,406 --> 01:01:29,273
"Standing In The Shadows
Of Love" in 14 takes.

245
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:34,516
<i>The vocal overdubs by the Four Tops,
however, required 52 takes.</i>

246
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:18,457
Jack Ashford played dozens of percussion
instruments. Some were his own invention...

247
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:24,302
like the "hotel sheet," which he used
on Marvin Gaye's "Got To Give It Up. "

248
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:59,031
Neither drummer, Pistol nor Uriel,
let on during filming that they were ill.

249
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:04,603
Uriel required quintuple bypass surgery
soon after production closed.

250
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:07,757
<i>Pistol was diagnosed
with terminal cancer and</i>

251
01:03:07,758 --> 01:03:10,675
died june 30, 2002,
before the film's release.

252
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:22,828
Pistol, with tongue-in-cheek,
describes a basic pop-rock beat.

253
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:36,699
Pistol Allen was the
master of the "Beale Street"

254
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:39,912
shuffle and the Motown
"four on the floor"' groove.

255
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:53,859
The "Beale Street" shuffle
originated in Memphis, Tennessee.

256
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:08,032
Pistol describes the session with producer
Norman Whitfield on February 3, 1967.

257
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:12,604
It was a track
intended for the Temptations.

258
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:25,789
Instead, Marvin Gaye overdubbed "I Heard
It Through The Grapevine" a few days later.

259
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:49,016
Ben Harper sings Marvin's version,
which at that time, sat in the can.

260
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:51,700
Gladys Knight & The
Pips' faster version was

261
01:04:51,701 --> 01:04:54,454
recorded, issued and
eventually hit number two.

262
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:13,088
Producer Whitfield fought with Berry

263
01:05:13,089 --> 01:05:16,611
Gordy for the release
of Marvin's version.

264
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:19,840
It was stuck on an album
more than a year later.

265
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:37,892
Radio found it and forced its release
as a single in November 1968...

266
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,632
when it became Motown's
most successful record to that point.

267
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:20,236
Marvin's "Grapevine" was number one
in the U.S. and the UK...

268
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:24,939
staying on top the U.S. R&B chart
for nearly two months.

269
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:06,511
Benny's substance abuse
led to chronic heart disease.

270
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:21,163
<i>Motown logs indicate
only two, brief sessions</i>

271
01:07:21,164 --> 01:07:23,202
for April 20, 1969, the day Benny died

272
01:07:23,203 --> 01:07:24,562
- and none the day after.

273
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:57,691
Joe Messina was considered the best
music reader of all The Funk Brothers.

274
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:06,806
He played
the complicated written parts.

275
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:23,114
Berry Gordy produced and released Marv
johnson's hit "Come To Me," in 1959...

276
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:27,685
the first record
on his independent Tamla label.

277
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:40,877
Joe was a staff guitarist at
WXYZ-TV. More than 10 years

278
01:09:40,878 --> 01:09:43,534
after he played for Soupy
Sales' nighttime TV band...

279
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:49,607
Soupy became a national comic sensation and
released a novelty album on Motown in 1969.

280
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,740
Eddie "Bongo" Brown started
his career as Marvin Gaye's valet.

281
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:34,989
Respect for Eddie's contributions
shows in the Motown recording set-up:

282
01:10:35,097 --> 01:10:37,608
unlike the three guitars,
which were combined on one

283
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:40,262
track, his congas were usually
given their own track...
