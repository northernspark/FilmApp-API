00:01:50,613 --> 00:01:52,387
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:54,635 --> 00:01:55,655
Oh, no, no.

5
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,918
I can't even remember
what got us started, babe.

6
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:02,603
You're too stubborn, Carter.

7
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,536
Sam, slow down,
watch where you're going.

8
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:20,128
You said you're gonna
clean up that field.

STANDOFF

10
00:03:03,873 --> 00:03:07,387
And so, we remember Crayton,
for what he had accomplished,

11
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:11,318
for his family,
a gift that we would treasure

12
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,721
You told Aunt Jane you quit.

13
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:19,370
Yeah, well. I gave up half of
my day to drive you up here.

14
00:03:19,395 --> 00:03:20,953
So, let's call it a truce and go wish

15
00:03:20,978 --> 00:03:23,732
you parents happy anniversary, okay, Bird.

16
00:03:23,757 --> 00:03:25,994
Don't call me that.

17
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:28,502
Okay, Isabelle.

18
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:32,290
Look, why don't we pay
our respects real quick?

19
00:03:33,596 --> 00:03:35,719
I don't want you to come.

20
00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:40,382
Fine, but leave the camera
here with me, okay?

21
00:03:42,253 --> 00:03:45,244
You know you can't hide
behind that thing forever.

22
00:03:46,798 --> 00:03:51,619
Okay, just don't take
any pictures of the service

23
00:03:51,644 --> 00:03:53,018
Okay.

24
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:57,303
Here you go.

25
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:01,358
I'll be right here.

26
00:04:03,749 --> 00:04:06,987
I'm serious about not
taking any pictures, Bird.

27
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:09,724
Isabelle.

28
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:32,968
Hi.

29
00:04:33,827 --> 00:04:37,097
I've been taking real
 good care of your camera.

30
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:42,509
I...

31
00:04:46,694 --> 00:04:50,223
And so, we remember Crayton,
for what he had accomplished,

32
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:16,623
May we leave here

33
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:21,852
with but one overarching
thought in out minds.

34
00:05:22,163 --> 00:05:25,245
That Crayton will always...

35
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:27,781
Father?

36
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,599
Please.
Please.

37
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:54,022
Ah!
Okay!

38
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,514
Okay.
Please.

39
00:05:56,539 --> 00:06:00,324
I understand it's...
it is over but...

40
00:06:00,824 --> 00:06:04,181
Please, I'm asking you...
We can talk about this.

41
00:06:04,206 --> 00:06:06,003
We can sit down.
We can make some kind of a deal.

42
00:06:06,028 --> 00:06:07,175
I... Just...
I'm begging you.

43
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,357
I'm begging you to
please just don't....

44
00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:11,245
Shhhh.

45
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,202
Take a good look.

46
00:06:20,675 --> 00:06:22,628
You only get one.

47
00:06:23,777 --> 00:06:26,588
- I don't know you.
- But, you know my employer.

48
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:29,433
You know you don't challenge
a man in his position.

49
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,599
Plea... Please.

50
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,726
I've shown you my face.

51
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,361
So, you're already dead.

52
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:36,093
Don't forget your book.

53
00:07:57,922 --> 00:07:59,702
Roger.

54
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:08,836
Isabelle!

55
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:11,557
Isabelle!

56
00:08:11,582 --> 00:08:12,697
Can I help you?

57
00:08:12,722 --> 00:08:15,977
Yeah, I'm looking for
a little girl in a red dress.

58
00:08:18,694 --> 00:08:21,791
Oh.
There's the little angel right now.

59
00:08:21,816 --> 00:08:24,895
Roger!
No!

60
00:08:27,136 --> 00:08:28,827
Roger!

61
00:10:08,871 --> 00:10:09,967
Help!

62
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:11,482
Help me!

63
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,084
HELP!

64
00:10:14,386 --> 00:10:16,723
Help me, please!

65
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:18,989
Help me!

66
00:10:19,963 --> 00:10:21,527
Help!

67
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:25,263
Help!

68
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:26,519
Hey.

69
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:28,115
Whoa, whoa whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.

70
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,994
It's okay. It's okay.
I can help you.

71
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:31,246
What happened?

72
00:10:31,271 --> 00:10:33,913
Tell me what happened?
Somebody hurt?

73
00:11:29,112 --> 00:11:31,414
Oh, fuck.

74
00:11:32,378 --> 00:11:33,738
Fuck.

75
00:11:33,763 --> 00:11:36,040
Hey, you took some potshot, did you?

76
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,762
Pssst!
Get back! Get back!

77
00:12:14,055 --> 00:12:15,818
Give it up, mister!

78
00:12:15,843 --> 00:12:17,909
You ain't getting through to me!

79
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:21,260
Just making sure you know your place.

80
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,961
MY PLACE?
Where is that, huh?

81
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:25,533
I'm sitting pretty on a high ground!

82
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:28,307
You waste your clip burying
bullets in the furniture.

83
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:31,228
That 45 ain't gonna cut a hole
through to me and you know it.

84
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:33,201
Not with that fucking
condom it's wearing.

85
00:12:33,226 --> 00:12:35,251
Well, well, well.

86
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:39,334
That man knows his guns.

87
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:47,903
So do I.

88
00:12:58,498 --> 00:13:00,208
Ohhh!

89
00:13:09,898 --> 00:13:14,382
Pitiful range you got with that candy ass
20 gauge you're riding up there.

90
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:17,268
You ain't nothing but
a quail hunter, boy.

91
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:20,394
And I damn sure ain't
no small game, you hear?

92
00:13:21,853 --> 00:13:26,318
You know, it's still enough to tear
you apart this close, asshole.

93
00:13:26,343 --> 00:13:27,955
Eh, you're right.

94
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:31,190
You know you're going to need
something damn sizable substantial

95
00:13:31,215 --> 00:13:32,513
if you really want to
rough up with me.

96
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:34,759
I've got plenty, buddy!

97
00:13:34,784 --> 00:13:38,357
You just try and come up 'em
fucking stairs again, okay!

98
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:41,264
I will blow your
fucking head clean off!

99
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:44,306
I'm getting the police
on the line, right now!

100
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,487
Phone's dead.

101
00:14:04,888 --> 00:14:07,985
Looks like I caught you
in a bad time.

102
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:15,170
I got a cell phone, asshole!

103
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:22,386
I know, dipshit.

104
00:14:24,444 --> 00:14:26,343
I'm looking at it.

105
00:14:27,861 --> 00:14:29,233
Shit!

106
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:32,870
You really ought to
keep this on you at all times.

107
00:14:32,895 --> 00:14:36,579
You know, for emergency and such.
I'm just saying.

108
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:38,347
Well, it don't matter anyway.

109
00:14:38,372 --> 00:14:40,335
The nearest cop is at least
a half an hour away from here

110
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,670
and I won't need but
a few minutes of your time.

111
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,165
You sound like
you're selling me sometin'.

112
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,617
Maybe I am,
maybe I ain't, friend.

113
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:52,676
Look.
Here's the situation.

114
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:56,206
That adorable little Muppet you got
up there, she's seen my face.

115
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:58,781
Hell, if she was a snake,
she would have bit me.

116
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,433
So, if I don't put a hole in
her head, and I mean like right quick,

117
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,917
somebody is going to do the same
thing to me and I can't allow that.

118
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:07,487
So, what I need you to do
is send her down,

119
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:10,321
So I can tidy things up a bit,
you understand?

120
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:12,608
Yeah.
You think she can identify you.

121
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:14,175
Ohhh.

122
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,349
Yes, I know she will,
as quick as a frog can lick flies.

123
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,896
But, you, on the other hand

124
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:20,823
you didn't see fuck all,
except the masked gunman.

125
00:15:20,848 --> 00:15:23,446
I can give less than
two shit about you.

126
00:15:23,471 --> 00:15:24,886
All I want is the girl.

127
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,644
So, why don't you
send her on down here,

128
00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:29,998
let me handle my business
and I'll be gone.

129
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:40,481
Look, son.

130
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:44,983
I understand the....
unfortunate and the...

131
00:15:45,008 --> 00:15:48,282
complex morale dilemma
that you're facing here.

132
00:15:48,307 --> 00:15:50,751
The wrap is real simple.

133
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:53,193
The little lady seen my face

134
00:15:53,564 --> 00:15:57,605
Now, she's got to pay the price,
like everybody else.

135
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,666
That's how it works.

136
00:16:02,123 --> 00:16:05,940
As far as you should be concerned,
she's already dead.

137
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:11,943
Now the sooner you allow me,
to prove that little point to you.

138
00:16:11,968 --> 00:16:14,555
The sooner you can
get back to your...

139
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,836
perfect little life here.

140
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,251
Now, I know you're bleeding up there.

141
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:25,118
And that does make time a factor,
so, here's what you're going to do.

142
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,821
You're going to send
the girl down to me.

143
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:30,876
Get yourself to a hospital,
get yourself fixed up.

144
00:16:30,901 --> 00:16:32,835
I'm going to take care of
my business and that will be that.

145
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,521
What do you say?

146
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:38,050
Believe me when I tell you, son.

147
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:40,255
You do not want to
fight me on this thing.

148
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,483
This will only devolve
into a battle of wills

149
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:47,176
and my will is strong than
anyone you have ever met.

150
00:16:51,196 --> 00:16:52,503
Yeah?

151
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:57,123
Well, you and me ain't never
been introduced, asshole.

152
00:16:57,148 --> 00:17:00,001
My name is Carter Greene.
This is my house!

153
00:17:00,026 --> 00:17:02,446
And so long as I'm still breathing,

154
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,914
you ain't gonna harm a hair
on this child's head.

155
00:17:06,965 --> 00:17:09,558
Listen, you just send the
little lady down here, right now.

156
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,962
This is not the time to play hero

157
00:17:12,004 --> 00:17:15,102
and I am the last individual
on god's green Earth

158
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:17,195
that you want to butt heads with.
You hear me?

159
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,206
Oh yeah, I heard you.

160
00:17:19,668 --> 00:17:22,681
I hear you and
you sound really scary.

161
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,532
Fuck you, farmer Jim!

162
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,069
You're alone out here on the frontier.

163
00:17:29,094 --> 00:17:33,557
No friends! No family! No cops!
No help at all!

164
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:35,887
This the wild west, son!

165
00:17:35,912 --> 00:17:38,341
The wild fucking west!

166
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:41,792
There ain't no guards coming
out here to save your ass!

167
00:17:41,817 --> 00:17:45,573
It's just you and me
and 'em murderer crows

168
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:48,716
waiting to pick over
our dead bones!

169
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:50,829
So, you take a breather.

170
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:54,027
You let that sink in.

171
00:17:54,713 --> 00:17:56,973
But, don't take too long, yeah?

172
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:01,611
Wouldn't want to get too much blood
all over your white trash finest.

173
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,506
I need your help.

174
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:12,266
I want you to go to the bathroom
and get the first aid kit.

175
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,131
It's under the sink, go.

176
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:29,251
Come to Papa.

177
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:32,855
Alright, set it down.
Open it up.

178
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,376
Come here.

179
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:38,193
You're going to help me, okay?

180
00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:44,961
Okay.

181
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,953
Now, get it real hot, okay?

182
00:18:55,115 --> 00:18:57,439
You just hold it on there.

183
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:04,424
Alright, let's put it down.

184
00:19:04,449 --> 00:19:06,007
Don't look.

185
00:19:17,464 --> 00:19:18,839
More.

186
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:22,669
Alright, more, more, more.
Come on.

187
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:23,785
Okay.

188
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,769
You're suppose to swallow them.

189
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:39,727
Not when it hurts
as bad as I do.

190
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,048
Go-Go in the other room.

191
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:46,038
In a box, there are
some light bulbs, okay?

192
00:19:46,063 --> 00:19:48,374
Bring me all of them.

193
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:52,451
And some... water.
Bring me some water.

194
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,235
I said all of them, go.

195
00:20:14,355 --> 00:20:16,380
Towels, bring me some towels.

196
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:18,850
The bathroom, go.
Go.

197
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:25,775
Please.

198
00:20:39,144 --> 00:20:40,412
Good.

199
00:21:12,598 --> 00:21:14,798
Ain't no farmer.

200
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:16,899
Now, even if we're not here,

201
00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:18,892
we'll hear him if he tries
to climb the upstairs.

202
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:21,977
Cool.
What's the water for?

203
00:21:22,854 --> 00:21:24,739
For drinking.

204
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,121
Oh.

205
00:21:29,903 --> 00:21:31,377
You want some?

206
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:51,503
So, what's your name?

207
00:21:51,528 --> 00:21:52,795
Isabelle.

208
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,732
But everyone calls me, Bird,
I don't like it though.

209
00:21:55,757 --> 00:21:57,177
Bird?

210
00:21:57,681 --> 00:22:00,304
How'd you get a
colorful name like that?

211
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:02,854
My dad gave it to me.

212
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:05,111
My mom said he started
calling me his little bird

213
00:22:05,136 --> 00:22:08,433
when I was real small because
I never wanted to eat.

214
00:22:09,182 --> 00:22:11,390
He died though.

215
00:22:12,346 --> 00:22:14,451
They both did.

216
00:22:14,842 --> 00:22:17,061
Car crash.

217
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,136
Car.

218
00:22:24,566 --> 00:22:26,449
I'm sorry.

219
00:22:29,301 --> 00:22:31,893
How did you get into
this mess anyway?

220
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:34,321
He shot Roger at the cemetery.

221
00:22:34,346 --> 00:22:35,451
Roger?

222
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,933
Aunt Jane's boyfriend.

223
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:42,607
Jesus.
I'm sorry.

224
00:22:44,018 --> 00:22:47,993
You apologize a lot for someone
who didn't do anything wrong.

225
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,397
Uh, no.
I just, you know.

226
00:22:51,422 --> 00:22:54,033
It's too bad your uncle's dead
and...

227
00:22:54,546 --> 00:22:56,727
Wasn't my uncle.

228
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,147
I should've been nicer to him.

229
00:23:44,602 --> 00:23:47,026
He's a monster.

230
00:23:48,913 --> 00:23:50,364
He's no monster.

231
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:54,343
Hey.
Don't give him the satisfaction.

232
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,333
He's no monster.

233
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,980
Yes, he is.

234
00:24:02,489 --> 00:24:04,381
You're all alone?

235
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:07,952
Those big companies moved in and...
this whole valley's a graveyard.

236
00:24:07,977 --> 00:24:12,107
Crops are alive.
Houses are dead.

237
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:16,815
There's nobody here
but scarecrows.

238
00:24:16,882 --> 00:24:18,786
And you.

239
00:24:19,822 --> 00:24:21,592
And me.

240
00:24:27,282 --> 00:24:29,530
How many bullets you have?

241
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:31,731
Just one.

242
00:24:32,998 --> 00:24:34,326
That's it?

243
00:24:34,351 --> 00:24:37,258
You don't have anymore
packed in a box or something.

244
00:24:37,283 --> 00:24:39,245
I'm afraid not.

245
00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:42,143
Last shell in the house.

246
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:44,856
Don't worry.

247
00:24:45,122 --> 00:24:46,949
He doesn't know that.

248
00:24:47,814 --> 00:24:50,117
Can we go out the window?

249
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:53,096
I may not ever make
it with this leg,

250
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:55,454
you can climb out on your own.

251
00:24:55,547 --> 00:25:00,109
But, I won't be there to protect you,
that's just what he wants.

252
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,139
Now, we're stuck here until help comes,

253
00:25:03,164 --> 00:25:04,944
he leaves.

254
00:25:07,248 --> 00:25:09,011
Thank you.

255
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,180
No, don't mention it, Isabelle.
Just...

256
00:25:12,205 --> 00:25:14,228
Just doing what's right.

257
00:25:15,563 --> 00:25:17,809
Call me Bird if you want.

258
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:20,947
I thought you didn't like that name.

259
00:25:22,592 --> 00:25:25,145
Depends on who's using it.

260
00:25:28,187 --> 00:25:30,502
Well, please to meet you, Bird.

261
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:33,481
I'm Carter, in case you missed it.

262
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:46,353
That's a nice camera you got there.

263
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,607
What're you... Taking pictures
of the cemetery or something?

264
00:25:51,123 --> 00:25:52,521
Him.

265
00:25:52,546 --> 00:25:54,954
I caught a picture of him
without his mask on.

266
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:56,470
Does he know that?

267
00:25:56,495 --> 00:25:57,588
I think so.

268
00:25:57,613 --> 00:26:00,104
Oh, that's great.
Give me the film.

269
00:26:06,238 --> 00:26:08,943
Harry, come down!

270
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,931
How's Bernard?

271
00:26:11,492 --> 00:26:13,138
Let me ask you.

272
00:26:16,382 --> 00:26:18,637
What's with all the boxes, huh?

273
00:26:23,074 --> 00:26:25,779
Fixing the jump ship?
Hm?

274
00:26:25,804 --> 00:26:30,329
I bet you wished you schedule
the big move a day earlier, huh?

275
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,436
So, hey, man.

276
00:26:35,492 --> 00:26:37,583
What happened to your family, huh?

277
00:26:37,608 --> 00:26:40,623
What? They up and
leave your sorry ass?

278
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,046
Is this a broken home
I'm sitting in?

279
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:49,436
Come on, bad ass, talk to me!
Don't be shy!

280
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,473
Shit, you can confide in me.

281
00:26:54,008 --> 00:26:57,286
Oh, whoa!
Look at here.

282
00:26:57,648 --> 00:26:59,640
Soldier boy.

283
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:01,486
You, a soldier boy.

284
00:27:01,511 --> 00:27:04,570
Damn good one, from the
looks of this photograph.

285
00:27:04,595 --> 00:27:06,364
Look at you,
all spit and polish

286
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,405
with your shiny medals
and your pretty ribbon.

287
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,411
Hey, where were you?

288
00:27:11,707 --> 00:27:13,987
Huh? Hey, look.
I'm ex-military too, man.

289
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:17,160
Black ops, you know, real jackal shit.
Where were you?

290
00:27:17,318 --> 00:27:20,082
Iraq?
No, no, no.

291
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:22,085
Afghanistan.

292
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,482
Hey, sergeant Greene.
Hey, sergeant Greene.

293
00:27:24,507 --> 00:27:27,967
As one ex-military man to another;

294
00:27:28,517 --> 00:27:32,753
I salute you and
thank you for your service.

295
00:27:35,126 --> 00:27:36,474
Damn.

296
00:27:37,178 --> 00:27:39,600
Nice looking woman
you had there, boy.

297
00:27:40,345 --> 00:27:42,288
Real nice looking.

298
00:27:42,313 --> 00:27:45,000
Hey, you don't mind if I get her
number when this is all over, do you?

299
00:27:45,025 --> 00:27:46,740
- Just shut up!
- Heyyy.

300
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,655
SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH!

301
00:27:50,177 --> 00:27:52,595
Oh, come on, sergeant Greene.

302
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,114
I'm just fucking with you
a little bit.

303
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,604
Ain't no need for you to get
all furiously articulate on me.

304
00:28:04,264 --> 00:28:05,967
Hey...

305
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:08,231
Just want to thank you.

306
00:28:08,802 --> 00:28:12,155
Took the liberty of...
dipping into you little reserve.

307
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:13,784
I've been feeling nice and warm,

308
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:16,357
I hope you got something up there
to keep you chill oloy too.

309
00:28:16,382 --> 00:28:18,456
Oh, and...

310
00:28:18,481 --> 00:28:22,516
All bullshit aside.
Just between you and me.

311
00:28:23,256 --> 00:28:25,315
I understand where you're
coming from with all this, man.

312
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,048
I understand,
I got a little girl myself.

313
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:28,253
She ain't but...

314
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:32,627
Well, she can't be no older than...
the lady up there and...

315
00:28:32,652 --> 00:28:34,854
She means the world to me.

316
00:28:35,284 --> 00:28:36,119
Uh.

317
00:28:36,144 --> 00:28:37,421
Nothing I wouldn't do
for that little girl.

318
00:28:37,446 --> 00:28:39,011
I mean, that's why
I'm in this line of work.

319
00:28:39,036 --> 00:28:40,921
You know, I got a family
that depends on me

320
00:28:40,946 --> 00:28:42,681
and I can't let one
little loose end

321
00:28:42,706 --> 00:28:45,384
with a pony tail take them
away from me, can I?

322
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:48,000
I mean, you can't let her
get in the way

323
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:51,037
of you taking care of your
responsibilities either.

324
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,822
Right?
I mean...

325
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:56,174
What's more important?
The life of a stranger or...

326
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:59,327
or the future of your family.
You feel me?

327
00:28:59,918 --> 00:29:01,543
- Take this.
- Man, am I right?

328
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,338
Put it at the back
of the toilet.

329
00:29:03,363 --> 00:29:04,581
In the toilet?

330
00:29:04,606 --> 00:29:06,673
- In the-In the tank.
- Oh.

331
00:29:06,698 --> 00:29:08,178
- Put it in the tank.
- Okay.

332
00:29:11,506 --> 00:29:13,568
Hey.
Let me ask you this.

333
00:29:13,593 --> 00:29:15,806
You want to see
your son again, right?

334
00:29:15,831 --> 00:29:17,569
I mean, am I right?

335
00:29:17,684 --> 00:29:20,008
Well, you ain't wrong wrong , mister.

336
00:29:20,848 --> 00:29:24,261
Whatcha think I got to lose, man,
I aint' lost?

337
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:28,311
The kid stays with me.
All right?

338
00:29:28,336 --> 00:29:31,321
Why don't you just go home
to your own daughter, huh?

339
00:29:31,596 --> 00:29:33,610
No can do, partner.

340
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,057
No can do.

341
00:29:38,482 --> 00:29:41,372
Once I sink my teeth into something
I don't pull them out,

342
00:29:41,397 --> 00:29:43,377
until the thing is dead.

343
00:29:43,487 --> 00:29:45,346
Yeah, you sure about that, pal?

344
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:47,548
Now, I wouldn't bet on you
lasting too long

345
00:29:47,573 --> 00:29:49,294
with that buckshot in your gut.

346
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:52,547
Oh, shit, man. By my standard,
this ain't nothing but a flash wound.

347
00:29:52,572 --> 00:29:55,850
Well, my's a flash wound
by anybody's standards, so...

348
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,832
We'll just see who drops first.

349
00:29:57,857 --> 00:29:59,948
Well, I got a feeling that
that's gonna be you

350
00:29:59,973 --> 00:30:02,745
once I burn this mother fucker
to the ground.

351
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,488
What you got to say to that?

352
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:06,828
I'm way ahead of you, asshole.

353
00:30:07,118 --> 00:30:09,807
Now, you know,
just as well as I do,

354
00:30:09,832 --> 00:30:11,970
the kid's got a picture of you
without your mask on.

355
00:30:11,995 --> 00:30:13,811
You see, I got you, man.

356
00:30:13,836 --> 00:30:15,501
Film's in a safe place.

357
00:30:15,526 --> 00:30:18,663
it's in a Ziploc bag
under the fucking water.

358
00:30:18,688 --> 00:30:21,435
You know damn well there's a
decent chance that film will survive

359
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,286
the fire for the cops to find.

360
00:30:23,311 --> 00:30:24,421
I got to think, man.

361
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:26,907
That's well past the
level of acceptable risk!

362
00:30:26,932 --> 00:30:29,736
For such a tiny professional as yourself!

363
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:33,479
You know your sneering condescending act
really sucks right about now, soldier boy.

364
00:30:33,504 --> 00:30:35,688
You should've stuck to
that pure hearted yoco bit.

365
00:30:35,713 --> 00:30:37,755
That shit was working for you.

366
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,896
Whatever you say, chief.

367
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:43,412
Oh, I want to break you into
a million pieces, mother fucker.

368
00:30:43,437 --> 00:30:46,127
A million tiny fucking pieces.

369
00:30:46,152 --> 00:30:49,423
You want to play with me?
Alright, then.

370
00:30:50,488 --> 00:30:53,042
It's feeling to get ugly
after this bitch.

371
00:30:56,748 --> 00:30:59,201
All quiet on the western front, kid?

372
00:30:59,226 --> 00:31:02,081
That's right.
Same as yesterday.

373
00:31:02,106 --> 00:31:04,984
Same as every yesterday.

374
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:08,285
I tell you. I don't know how this place keeps
self together between my rounds.

375
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:12,015
Baker, it's either gets and like it.
Just swallow and smile, kid.

376
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,890
Ed, I got a question for you.

377
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:16,577
When you old dogs're going
to stop calling me kid?

378
00:31:16,602 --> 00:31:18,485
Till you earn your wings.

379
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:22,115
Don't take offense.
That's just how it is around these parts.

380
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:25,158
And how do I earn my wings?

381
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:29,176
Well, you can start by getting
your ass over to Clem Sagers' place

382
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:31,982
Them teenagers been
messing around on his land.

383
00:31:32,007 --> 00:31:33,716
Again?

384
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:38,913
You see something, kid?

385
00:31:41,017 --> 00:31:44,199
It's probably nothing,
I'll-I'll get back to you.

386
00:32:40,414 --> 00:32:41,554
(Carter.)

387
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:44,757
(Where's Sam?
Where's Sam, Carter?)

388
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:57,213
Bird.

389
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,423
Bird, I need a drink.

390
00:33:03,226 --> 00:33:05,169
More water?

391
00:33:05,386 --> 00:33:06,693
No.

392
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:10,552
There's some other bottles
up in the attic.

393
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:15,515
Aunt Jane gets angry
when she drinks.

394
00:33:16,585 --> 00:33:19,421
Yeah. Well,
I get angry when I don't drink.

395
00:33:19,555 --> 00:33:21,961
Hey.
Listen.

396
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:24,096
Go get me a bottle.

397
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:13,915
Where did you get that?

398
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,150
I'm sorry, I'll put it back.

399
00:34:15,175 --> 00:34:16,943
Where did you get that?
Put it back.

400
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:19,954
Put it back now.

401
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:11,100
Mara.

402
00:35:13,004 --> 00:35:15,414
I could never say this,

403
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:18,162
to you face to face.

404
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,000
Even though you told me
over and over again that

405
00:35:22,025 --> 00:35:24,438
it wasn't my fault.

406
00:35:24,548 --> 00:35:26,847
Your eyes never hid the truth.

407
00:35:26,872 --> 00:35:29,059
I killed our son.

408
00:35:29,677 --> 00:35:31,772
I let him die.

409
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:50,842
I want you know that you did
the right thing leaving me.

410
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:53,686
You mother fucker.

411
00:35:57,841 --> 00:36:01,466
I hope one day you find it
in your heart to forgive me.

412
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:04,881
I'm so sorry I was so weak,

413
00:36:04,906 --> 00:36:06,620
Carter.

414
00:36:18,883 --> 00:36:21,358
God damn, sergeant Greene.

415
00:36:21,383 --> 00:36:23,501
That sure is a whole
lot of apologies.

416
00:36:23,526 --> 00:36:27,061
Exactly how many kids
did you get killed?

417
00:36:33,675 --> 00:36:35,706
Don't look at me.

418
00:36:36,505 --> 00:36:38,357
Don't look at me!

419
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:43,321
Well. Now I know why you
had that cannon so handy.

420
00:36:43,605 --> 00:36:45,772
You packed the place up,

421
00:36:46,857 --> 00:36:50,317
got drunk, then you stopped
and thought about it.

422
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:51,373
Decided that,

423
00:36:51,398 --> 00:36:53,876
life wasn't worth living anymore, was it?

424
00:36:53,901 --> 00:36:55,389
What the hell.

425
00:36:57,684 --> 00:37:01,482
Don't let this little fiasco with
the kid ruin you whole afternoon.

426
00:37:01,507 --> 00:37:02,950
By all means, go ahead,

427
00:37:02,975 --> 00:37:04,625
act like the two of us
ain't even here

428
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,474
and blow your god damn brains out!

429
00:37:12,403 --> 00:37:14,239
Woo hoo hoo.

430
00:37:14,928 --> 00:37:18,220
But, no, seriously, man.
I know where you're coming from though.

431
00:37:18,245 --> 00:37:19,692
I do.

432
00:37:21,164 --> 00:37:23,172
Shit, she ain't your kid.

433
00:37:24,634 --> 00:37:28,177
Can't turn back time.
Believe me, I've tried.

434
00:37:28,836 --> 00:37:31,439
But, you know I'm
going to win this thing.

435
00:37:31,867 --> 00:37:34,705
Even tombstone courage runs out.

436
00:37:35,996 --> 00:37:39,240
You need to go head on
and give in to the beast.

437
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:43,153
Send the little lady
down here to me.

438
00:37:47,647 --> 00:37:49,384
Come and get her.

439
00:38:04,262 --> 00:38:05,903
Hello!

440
00:38:16,872 --> 00:38:18,482
Hey!

441
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:21,376
You guys wanna order some pizza?

442
00:38:27,337 --> 00:38:29,422
I'm sorry.

443
00:38:30,898 --> 00:38:33,301
No, don't be sorry.
I...

444
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:36,055
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

445
00:38:46,101 --> 00:38:48,537
What was your son's name?

446
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,820
Sam.

447
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,600
You missed him?

448
00:38:58,097 --> 00:38:59,593
Everyday.

449
00:38:59,618 --> 00:39:02,223
I missed my parents too.

450
00:39:05,615 --> 00:39:08,221
There ain't no quitting me.

451
00:39:08,397 --> 00:39:09,784
What?

452
00:39:10,784 --> 00:39:14,966
"There ain't no quitting me."
Just something my dad used to say.

453
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:20,209
It always made me feel safe.

454
00:39:24,002 --> 00:39:26,469
You think I'll see him
when I die?

455
00:39:27,146 --> 00:39:29,739
Hey, don't talk like that, okay?

456
00:39:30,053 --> 00:39:32,182
Help will be here soon.

457
00:39:32,207 --> 00:39:35,362
Don't say that, Carter,
I'm not stupid.

458
00:39:37,973 --> 00:39:39,386
Alright.

459
00:39:40,406 --> 00:39:42,360
Maybe help ain't coming.

460
00:39:45,567 --> 00:39:47,993
But, I can promise you this.

461
00:39:50,377 --> 00:39:52,693
I won't let him get you.

462
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,200
You hear me?

463
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:59,200
I won't let him get you.

464
00:40:02,177 --> 00:40:04,036
You believe me?

465
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,274
Why did your wife leave?

466
00:40:13,347 --> 00:40:14,812
Me.

467
00:40:15,694 --> 00:40:17,369
This place.

468
00:40:19,768 --> 00:40:24,043
Reminded...
her of him.

469
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,754
I just wish...

470
00:40:32,241 --> 00:40:33,817
just...

471
00:40:35,576 --> 00:40:36,933
wish...

472
00:40:43,282 --> 00:40:45,374
I believe you.

473
00:40:53,398 --> 00:40:56,184
Just keeping you on your toes, buddy.

474
00:40:56,827 --> 00:40:58,596
Here, have another one.

475
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:14,071
How you all doing up there?

476
00:41:14,143 --> 00:41:17,560
I could ask you the same question,
you little sack of shit.

477
00:41:17,585 --> 00:41:20,524
You know you sound
like a sick animal.

478
00:41:20,549 --> 00:41:23,782
Just hunting around
for a corner to die in.

479
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:27,419
You feeling kind of cold?
Kind of weak?

480
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:31,731
Yeah.
You're going into shock, pal.

481
00:41:32,078 --> 00:41:34,631
You're gonna die,
soon.

482
00:41:34,656 --> 00:41:37,119
Unless you get to a hospital.

483
00:41:37,757 --> 00:41:40,303
Fuck you, I'm fine!

484
00:41:40,525 --> 00:41:44,645
I ain't going no where till that little
bitch's pushing up daisies, period!

485
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:47,874
That suits me just fine, mister.

486
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,422
Nothing bleeds forever.

487
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,732
Another few hours,

488
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:56,807
you be lying face down in
a puddle of your own fluids.

489
00:41:56,832 --> 00:41:58,797
Hey, you don't worry though!

490
00:41:58,822 --> 00:42:03,448
I'll let your daughter know you died
defending the future of your family.

491
00:42:03,551 --> 00:42:07,479
Oh, outstanding, sergeant Greene,
out-fucking-standing!

492
00:42:07,504 --> 00:42:09,437
You beat me at my own game!

493
00:42:09,462 --> 00:42:13,151
You're master of psychological warfare!

494
00:42:13,182 --> 00:42:15,900
Next thing you know, you'll
have me tidying up the place

495
00:42:15,925 --> 00:42:18,896
and giving you a blow job
on the way out!

496
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:20,579
Brilliant!

497
00:42:22,425 --> 00:42:24,388
- Sorry.
- What're you doing?

498
00:42:24,413 --> 00:42:26,723
No film in that camera.

499
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:32,690
Yeah, it just makes me feel safe.
Stupid, I know.

500
00:42:34,441 --> 00:42:37,140
We all got our ways
in dealing with stuff.

501
00:42:47,254 --> 00:42:49,501
What?
What is it?

502
00:42:49,731 --> 00:42:51,307
Shit.

503
00:42:51,948 --> 00:42:53,926
Just reminds me.

504
00:42:53,951 --> 00:42:55,775
We got a problem.

505
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:58,063
How big?

506
00:42:58,198 --> 00:42:59,905
It's big.

507
00:43:00,782 --> 00:43:03,653
There's a generator in the basement
that runs the whole power, you see.

508
00:43:03,686 --> 00:43:05,911
I haven't filled it up in days.

509
00:43:07,259 --> 00:43:09,433
It's running on the fumes.

510
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:11,478
I don't understand?

511
00:43:11,503 --> 00:43:13,113
It would be night soon, Bird.

512
00:43:13,138 --> 00:43:16,256
Without any power, the whole house
would be pitch black.

513
00:43:16,281 --> 00:43:19,276
There's no way I can keep him
from trying something in the dark.

514
00:43:19,301 --> 00:43:21,204
Not with one shot.

515
00:43:21,546 --> 00:43:23,793
What does that mean?

516
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,908
It means I got to
get you out of here.

517
00:43:27,933 --> 00:43:30,122
While it's still light up.

518
00:43:31,048 --> 00:43:33,096
But your leg.

519
00:43:33,969 --> 00:43:35,759
I'm not going with you.

520
00:43:35,784 --> 00:43:38,274
I'm gonna help you climb out
a window so you can run for help.

521
00:43:38,299 --> 00:43:39,945
But you said that's what he wants.

522
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:42,141
I know what I said, Bird,
but things are different now, okay?

523
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:44,424
You got to trust me on this.

524
00:43:44,586 --> 00:43:46,817
This is your best chance.

525
00:43:47,753 --> 00:43:49,277
Okay.

526
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:00,490
Oh, fuck.

527
00:44:08,002 --> 00:44:12,320
Hey. Is the... shooting range in
Red Pepper open for the fall yet?

528
00:44:13,498 --> 00:44:14,831
What's that, kid?

529
00:44:14,856 --> 00:44:18,742
The shooting range on Red Pepper,
is it open now?

530
00:44:18,767 --> 00:44:20,797
No.
Why?

531
00:44:21,249 --> 00:44:23,041
I'm not sure.
I'm...

532
00:44:23,066 --> 00:44:25,799
I'm at the cemetery and
I heard...

533
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:30,378
What's that?
What did you hear, kid?

534
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,328
Kid?

535
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:35,873
Nothing.

536
00:44:36,536 --> 00:44:38,880
I'm looking into something,
I'll get back to you.

537
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,111
And stop calling me kid.

538
00:44:59,028 --> 00:45:00,725
Alright, let's go.

539
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:03,121
What if he realizes you aren't
guarding the stairs anymore.

540
00:45:03,145 --> 00:45:05,479
He hit the broken glass,
we'll hear him, come on.

541
00:45:05,504 --> 00:45:07,565
Now, I want you to climb down
on this roof, right?

542
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:10,611
There's a crate, jump down
on it and run like hell.

543
00:45:10,636 --> 00:45:12,749
Alright?
Hey, hey.

544
00:45:12,774 --> 00:45:15,352
Even if he hears you, you'll be
a little speck on the horizon

545
00:45:15,377 --> 00:45:16,627
by the time he gets outside.

546
00:45:16,652 --> 00:45:18,024
I don't want to do this.

547
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,250
Neither do I, Bird,
but we have to.

548
00:45:20,275 --> 00:45:22,148
We don't have a choice.

549
00:45:44,384 --> 00:45:46,601
- Come on, give me the camera.
- No.

550
00:45:46,822 --> 00:45:48,368
Come on.
I'll take good care of it.

551
00:45:48,393 --> 00:45:49,853
Don't you trust me?

552
00:45:49,878 --> 00:45:51,213
Come on.

553
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,657
Bird.
I...

554
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,974
Okay, keep the camera.
Come on, go.

555
00:45:59,496 --> 00:46:00,776
That's it.

556
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:02,974
Stay low.

557
00:46:05,306 --> 00:46:07,793
Okay, go.
Go on.

558
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:11,784
That's it.
You got it.

559
00:46:56,187 --> 00:46:58,187
Afternoon, officer.

560
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:02,969
What the fuck?

561
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:05,930
Shit.

562
00:47:16,944 --> 00:47:18,402
Shit!

563
00:47:58,965 --> 00:48:00,534
Carter.

564
00:48:01,048 --> 00:48:02,393
What?

565
00:48:02,418 --> 00:48:05,393
He hid the police car in the hanger.

566
00:48:11,006 --> 00:48:13,143
What?
Where is he now?

567
00:48:15,474 --> 00:48:19,178
He's far. He's walking
back around the front.

568
00:48:26,714 --> 00:48:27,945
Freeze!

569
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,208
Put your fucking
hands up in the air.

570
00:48:30,233 --> 00:48:31,483
Hands up.

571
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:34,865
That's right.
It's over.

572
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:36,963
It's time for you to leave.

573
00:48:36,988 --> 00:48:39,317
I ain't got my glasses on
but that looks that same

574
00:48:39,342 --> 00:48:42,550
candy ass 20 gauge you been
counting on this whole time.

575
00:48:42,575 --> 00:48:45,482
Heavy on power.
Shit for range.

576
00:48:45,998 --> 00:48:48,241
That's all you got, ain't it?

577
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:52,073
You got, until the count of five,

578
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:55,690
to turn around and get
the FUCK off my property!

579
00:48:55,715 --> 00:48:56,920
You got to be kidding me.

580
00:48:56,945 --> 00:49:00,060
You probably couldn't even nick me
with that potty trainer from up there.

581
00:49:00,085 --> 00:49:02,592
Let alone make a kill shot, hell.

582
00:49:02,617 --> 00:49:04,896
How many bullets you got left, Jethro?

583
00:49:04,921 --> 00:49:07,753
I got plenty!
Alright!

584
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:11,391
Don't you worry about it. I got
six reloads waiting on your ass!

585
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:15,090
Good. God damn!
Six reloads!

586
00:49:15,115 --> 00:49:17,488
You practically swimming
in ammunitions up there.

587
00:49:17,513 --> 00:49:19,594
Well, why no go ahead
and try you luck.

588
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:22,010
You might sink a pellet in
my eye, take me down.

589
00:49:22,035 --> 00:49:24,863
Come on, what's you waiting on?
Fire away!

590
00:49:24,901 --> 00:49:27,192
I'm not going to kill you
if I don't have to.

591
00:49:27,217 --> 00:49:28,565
When I first go to this dump

592
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,784
you spit fire at me
just to say howdy-do.

593
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:34,264
Now you want to play trigger shy,
I don't buy that for a minute.

594
00:49:34,289 --> 00:49:38,812
Are you riding on just
one shell up there, partner?

595
00:49:38,952 --> 00:49:40,799
You are, aren't you?

596
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:44,543
And if you take a shot
at this range and MISS,

597
00:49:44,568 --> 00:49:45,608
it's over.

598
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:48,204
I don't think you could
afford to take that risk.

599
00:49:48,229 --> 00:49:50,324
Let's ask the little lady.

600
00:49:52,435 --> 00:49:53,718
5.

601
00:49:53,743 --> 00:49:54,957
I ain't going no where.

602
00:49:54,982 --> 00:49:57,169
You might as well save
your breath go on and shoot.

603
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:58,104
4.

604
00:49:58,135 --> 00:50:00,595
Look, I'm betting if I pull my pistol out
I can shoot you there.

605
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:01,580
3!

606
00:50:01,605 --> 00:50:04,305
I suggest you ought to shoot me
or get your ass back inside.

607
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:05,479
2!

608
00:50:05,504 --> 00:50:06,377
One!

609
00:50:06,402 --> 00:50:07,540
Shit!

610
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:12,129
I ain't calling you a liar, sergeant Greene.

611
00:50:12,154 --> 00:50:14,742
But you got to the most
merciful man I've ever met.

612
00:50:14,767 --> 00:50:16,384
Hey, little lady.

613
00:50:18,233 --> 00:50:20,371
I just want to shoot you.

614
00:50:20,396 --> 00:50:23,003
Yeah, you made the right call, soldier boy.

615
00:50:23,028 --> 00:50:24,335
Yes, indeed.

616
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,652
Who are you to gamble
with that little girl's life.

617
00:50:28,172 --> 00:50:31,231
Let's see if you'll gamble
with somebody else's.

618
00:50:35,901 --> 00:50:37,940
Roll call!

619
00:50:37,971 --> 00:50:39,472
As you is.

620
00:50:39,497 --> 00:50:41,317
Come on.

621
00:50:41,342 --> 00:50:42,817
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

622
00:50:42,842 --> 00:50:44,654
You sick son of a bitch.

623
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:47,730
Don't you disappoint me, hillbilly.

624
00:50:47,755 --> 00:50:49,834
I said, speak up!

625
00:50:50,055 --> 00:50:52,415
So the man upstairs can hear you.

626
00:50:54,103 --> 00:50:56,147
My name is officer Jerry Baker.

627
00:50:56,172 --> 00:51:00,092
Jerry Baker!
Ha ha ha ha...

628
00:51:00,124 --> 00:51:01,597
Come on,
tell us about the...

629
00:51:01,635 --> 00:51:04,144
about the wife, kids
two car garage.

630
00:51:04,169 --> 00:51:06,254
I have-have a wife
and a son.

631
00:51:06,284 --> 00:51:09,202
Names, damn it!
Give the man names!

632
00:51:09,265 --> 00:51:11,887
My wife's name is Linda.
My son's name...

633
00:51:11,912 --> 00:51:13,640
Alright!
Cut it out!

634
00:51:13,665 --> 00:51:15,658
It ain't going to work.

635
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:17,877
Just save yourself the effort!

636
00:51:17,902 --> 00:51:19,864
You need to think about it,
sergeant Greene.

637
00:51:19,889 --> 00:51:21,688
You need to think about it real hard.

638
00:51:21,713 --> 00:51:24,303
Get your mind right, you see.

639
00:51:24,328 --> 00:51:28,002
Jerry here, ain't seen my face
just like you, which means...

640
00:51:28,027 --> 00:51:30,081
Technically, he's off the hook.

641
00:51:30,106 --> 00:51:32,215
Also, he's not hurt too bad.

642
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,815
Which means you can probably
get him to the hospital.

643
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,554
But, you're going to have to do it
right quick, I mean like, pronto.

644
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:40,574
You don't have the leverage
that you think you do, asshole.

645
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:43,357
Fuck leverage!
Do the math, dipshit!

646
00:51:43,382 --> 00:51:45,468
You send the little lady
down to me right now,

647
00:51:45,493 --> 00:51:48,604
You're saving 2 lives
in exchange for 1.

648
00:51:48,642 --> 00:51:51,483
Not to toot my own horn, but,
that's a hell of a bargain.

649
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:53,457
Fuck you!

650
00:51:53,482 --> 00:51:54,398
Okay!

651
00:51:54,423 --> 00:51:57,172
You heard him, Jerry.
Have it your way.

652
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,824
Oh, quit your whining.

653
00:52:02,901 --> 00:52:05,492
Hold on. Hold on.
I got something here for you.

654
00:52:05,517 --> 00:52:06,707
Here we go.

655
00:52:06,732 --> 00:52:08,340
- No, no, no.
- Alright.

656
00:52:08,365 --> 00:52:09,513
No.

657
00:52:09,538 --> 00:52:11,790
That's it.
Oh, yeah. That's it.

658
00:52:11,815 --> 00:52:13,964
- Alright?
- What're you doing?

659
00:52:13,989 --> 00:52:15,884
Stand back now.

660
00:52:27,325 --> 00:52:28,855
Oh, god!

661
00:52:32,912 --> 00:52:35,202
What's he doing?

662
00:52:35,605 --> 00:52:38,228
Get out of here.
Go, go upstairs.

663
00:52:38,253 --> 00:52:40,944
Get upstairs, now!
Go.

664
00:52:41,682 --> 00:52:43,171
Don't listen.

665
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:48,162
Four down,
four to go!

666
00:52:48,187 --> 00:52:50,541
- Your thumbs getting past.
- Oh, you shit fuck.

667
00:52:50,566 --> 00:52:53,476
Listen up, soldier boy!
What's it gonna be?

668
00:52:53,501 --> 00:52:56,397
Me and Jerry Baker waiting
for you to send her ass down.

669
00:52:56,422 --> 00:52:58,176
You piece of shit.

670
00:52:58,201 --> 00:53:00,981
You're a piece of fucking shit,
you know that?

671
00:53:01,006 --> 00:53:03,094
Sticks and stones, my friend.

672
00:53:04,188 --> 00:53:07,067
Alright, have it your way.

673
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:09,913
- Please.
- Stay with me now.

674
00:53:09,938 --> 00:53:11,202
Just you and me.

675
00:53:11,227 --> 00:53:13,090
Please, stop.

676
00:53:35,915 --> 00:53:39,106
I was going to start
with the toes, but...

677
00:53:39,131 --> 00:53:42,024
I guess I lost the stomach
for the hard stuff.

678
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:47,282
Hey!
Listen, partner.

679
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,373
It's decision time.

680
00:53:49,624 --> 00:53:51,503
Please, don't.

681
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:55,243
Please.

682
00:53:55,847 --> 00:53:57,654
Listen, man!

683
00:53:57,792 --> 00:54:00,967
If you don't send that
little girl down here,

684
00:54:00,992 --> 00:54:04,555
with that film,
and I mean right now!

685
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:08,086
I'm fixing the Jackson Pollock,
Jerry Baker's brains

686
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:11,643
all over the mother fucking floor.

687
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:15,383
Man. You kill that guy
is because you want to!

688
00:54:15,408 --> 00:54:17,371
You're just looking for an excuse!

689
00:54:17,396 --> 00:54:20,782
You want to kill somebody!
You go ahead!

690
00:54:20,807 --> 00:54:22,833
You got fucking brain damage!

691
00:54:22,858 --> 00:54:25,781
You're a sick fuck!
And you want to!

692
00:54:25,806 --> 00:54:27,542
Not because...

693
00:54:49,191 --> 00:54:52,230
A simple yes or no
would have worked.

694
00:54:53,814 --> 00:54:55,403
But, you know.

695
00:54:55,522 --> 00:54:57,526
You really piss me off, Jethro.

696
00:54:57,551 --> 00:55:01,366
A matter of fact, you've lost
all your conversation privileges.

697
00:55:01,391 --> 00:55:05,230
Yeah!
Radio silence, starts right now!

698
00:55:05,255 --> 00:55:09,088
And it ends, when you're ready
to send that little girl down!

699
00:55:09,113 --> 00:55:11,604
Now, that suits me just fine, asshole.

700
00:55:11,629 --> 00:55:14,666
I'm sick of hearing your
god damn voice anyway.

701
00:55:17,306 --> 00:55:18,987
Just do me a favour
when you dropped dead

702
00:55:19,012 --> 00:55:20,474
just do it real loud, okay?

703
00:55:20,499 --> 00:55:22,918
So, I can hear it from up here.

704
00:55:58,793 --> 00:56:01,754
I don't hear him walking around anymore.

705
00:56:04,973 --> 00:56:06,940
What's he doing?

706
00:56:17,066 --> 00:56:18,949
Let's find out.

707
00:56:20,591 --> 00:56:22,787
Alright, cock sucker.

708
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:27,623
Alright, you win.
I got to...

709
00:56:28,435 --> 00:56:31,188
I got to get to a hospital, man.

710
00:56:31,213 --> 00:56:32,791
You-You can have her.

711
00:56:32,816 --> 00:56:35,116
You can have the girl, okay?

712
00:56:38,402 --> 00:56:41,274
You hear me?
You win.

713
00:56:41,745 --> 00:56:44,791
I'm sending her down, alright?
Just...

714
00:56:44,978 --> 00:56:48,405
Just get the fuck out of here
when I do, okay?

715
00:56:57,411 --> 00:56:59,386
He ain't down there.

716
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,389
He must have gone outside again.

717
00:57:03,414 --> 00:57:05,536
I'm gonna sneak down there
want for him to come back in

718
00:57:05,561 --> 00:57:07,000
and blow him in half.

719
00:57:07,025 --> 00:57:08,755
- It's a trick.
- No, no.

720
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,134
I just offered you up
like he won

721
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:12,818
so that he drops anything
else he got cooking.

722
00:57:12,843 --> 00:57:15,897
He ain't talking back because
he ain't down there.

723
00:57:15,922 --> 00:57:18,471
No, he's waiting for you.

724
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:21,622
Get in the bathroom,
lock the door.

725
00:57:22,034 --> 00:57:23,538
Carter, don't go.

726
00:57:23,563 --> 00:57:26,812
No time to argue. You get in there.
Go, now!

727
00:57:26,837 --> 00:57:28,516
Don't come out.

728
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,477
Bird.

729
00:59:45,301 --> 00:59:47,286
Carter, are you back?

730
00:59:47,311 --> 00:59:49,735
Hey, now, little lady,
come on out.

731
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,120
Shit!

732
00:59:51,145 --> 00:59:52,151
Whoa!

733
00:59:59,154 --> 01:00:00,187
FUCK!

734
01:00:00,212 --> 01:00:01,608
Fuck.

735
01:00:03,312 --> 01:00:06,501
Damn, that kind of hurt!

736
01:00:06,526 --> 01:00:07,926
Ahh!

737
01:00:07,951 --> 01:00:10,326
This really ain't your day, pal.

738
01:00:10,351 --> 01:00:11,797
Hey, you want to think about

739
01:00:11,822 --> 01:00:14,378
packing it in,
heading to the hospital, huh?

740
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:16,622
Or somebody gets hurt.

741
01:00:16,897 --> 01:00:18,312
Man.

742
01:00:22,253 --> 01:00:24,872
Think it ain't looking
too good for you, buddy!

743
01:00:24,897 --> 01:00:27,367
This is a lousy place
for the end of the road.

744
01:00:27,392 --> 01:00:29,402
You think this shit is funny, huh?

745
01:00:30,581 --> 01:00:32,452
Okay, hillbilly.

746
01:00:33,562 --> 01:00:35,013
Alright.

747
01:00:40,646 --> 01:00:43,273
I'll show you how funny
this shit is.

748
01:00:48,669 --> 01:00:50,185
That ain't nothing.

749
01:01:05,847 --> 01:01:07,369
Fuck the film.

750
01:01:07,394 --> 01:01:09,540
I'll take my chances.

751
01:01:23,378 --> 01:01:25,152
What're you doing?

752
01:01:30,151 --> 01:01:32,581
Wouldn't you like to know?

753
01:02:25,267 --> 01:02:27,178
Yeah, that's good, man.

754
01:02:28,219 --> 01:02:31,303
Keep moving around,
keep that blood pumping.

755
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:35,202
Wouldn't want  you to lay down,

756
01:02:36,741 --> 01:02:39,844
close your eyes and
never open them again.

757
01:02:40,689 --> 01:02:42,906
Go fuck yourself.

758
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:45,206
What?

759
01:02:45,448 --> 01:02:47,366
Trying to help you.

760
01:02:48,308 --> 01:02:51,056
Believe me. That's not
such a bad way to go.

761
01:02:51,081 --> 01:02:54,345
You just kind of...
drift off.

762
01:02:55,084 --> 01:02:58,048
Yeah? What dead mother fucker
did you hear that from?

763
01:03:01,488 --> 01:03:04,830
You know. I'm surprise
you haven't called for backup.

764
01:03:04,855 --> 01:03:06,401
Backup?

765
01:03:08,529 --> 01:03:10,884
That little girl IDs me.

766
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:14,413
It's my ass, not my employers.

767
01:03:15,414 --> 01:03:18,589
My witness.
My problem.

768
01:03:19,678 --> 01:03:23,488
I'm a contractor, mister.
A professional.

769
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:27,986
I don't lose.
I don't ask for help.

770
01:03:28,011 --> 01:03:30,398
That's what keeps me employed.

771
01:03:30,423 --> 01:03:32,177
Yeah, well.

772
01:03:32,202 --> 01:03:34,460
It just gonna puts you
in the ground too

773
01:03:34,487 --> 01:03:37,495
you know,
throw in the towel soon, buddy.

774
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,170
I mean, what the fuck
are we doing, man?

775
01:03:40,195 --> 01:03:43,229
This is like a pissing contest for you?

776
01:03:43,254 --> 01:03:47,992
Life ain't nothing but one big
fucking pissing contest, soldier boy

777
01:03:48,017 --> 01:03:50,444
Ain't you been paying attention?

778
01:03:50,469 --> 01:03:51,876
Shit.

779
01:03:51,901 --> 01:03:56,481
I don't die unless the mother fucker
trying to kill me, earns it.

780
01:03:56,506 --> 01:03:58,417
You ain't earned it.

781
01:03:58,442 --> 01:04:03,141
Be damn if I let some chicken shit
like you take me out.

782
01:04:04,339 --> 01:04:06,665
You saying about me.

783
01:04:07,993 --> 01:04:10,937
I'm not the guy
you're fighting, am I?

784
01:04:11,955 --> 01:04:13,517
Yeah.

785
01:04:13,622 --> 01:04:16,340
I'm starting to understand.

786
01:04:17,724 --> 01:04:20,746
You'll never understand
a man like me, chump.

787
01:04:22,144 --> 01:04:25,699
Are you really the monster
you want me to think you are?

788
01:04:27,158 --> 01:04:29,219
You don't have a daughter, do you?

789
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:31,172
Yeah, I got a daughter.

790
01:04:31,197 --> 01:04:33,537
What.
You think monsters don't breed?

791
01:04:33,562 --> 01:04:36,789
But, how did you get to be
what you are?

792
01:04:38,072 --> 01:04:40,764
Oh, what the fuck is it with you?

793
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:44,661
You want to be my friend?
You want to be my shrink? Huh?

794
01:04:44,686 --> 01:04:49,066
Or you did just fall in love with
the velvet baritone of my voice.

795
01:04:49,091 --> 01:04:50,674
Come on, man.

796
01:04:51,993 --> 01:04:53,821
You want to know?

797
01:04:54,572 --> 01:04:56,452
Tough guy, huh?

798
01:04:57,681 --> 01:05:00,366
How you get to be like me?

799
01:05:07,171 --> 01:05:08,642
Jesus.

800
01:05:09,315 --> 01:05:10,928
Let's see.

801
01:05:11,215 --> 01:05:13,067
Oh, yeah.

802
01:05:14,003 --> 01:05:16,355
First guy I killed,

803
01:05:17,102 --> 01:05:19,184
brought me up, a bit.

804
01:05:19,596 --> 01:05:21,495
No, a lot.

805
01:05:22,033 --> 01:05:26,065
I couldn't eat,
couldn't sleep.

806
01:05:26,949 --> 01:05:29,641
Can't even look myself in the mirror.

807
01:05:30,121 --> 01:05:32,494
Then something strange happened.

808
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:35,690
Killed another fellow,
I felt a little better.

809
01:05:35,935 --> 01:05:38,881
Killed another fellow,
I felt a little better.

810
01:05:39,287 --> 01:05:41,723
The fellow after that, better.

811
01:05:41,828 --> 01:05:44,878
Pretty soon, the more jobs
I got under my belt.

812
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,893
The easier I slept at night.

813
01:05:49,335 --> 01:05:51,900
How many people would that take?

814
01:05:51,925 --> 01:05:55,446
I don't know, I don't count.
Let's just say.

815
01:05:55,905 --> 01:05:59,519
These days I sleep like a baby.

816
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:01,081
I don't know.

817
01:06:01,106 --> 01:06:03,607
I don't know how you could
live with something like that.

818
01:06:04,063 --> 01:06:06,644
There's something I read once...

819
01:06:07,118 --> 01:06:09,117
stuck with me.

820
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:13,136
He who makes a beast of himself

821
01:06:14,983 --> 01:06:18,098
loses the pain of being a man.

822
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:19,689
Wow.

823
01:06:21,378 --> 01:06:24,339
We all got our ways
in dealing with stuff.

824
01:06:26,176 --> 01:06:28,150
Guess for you, it's killing people.

825
01:06:28,175 --> 01:06:32,128
I kill 'cos it's my job,
I take orders.

826
01:06:33,078 --> 01:06:34,890
You were a soldier,
you know what that's like.

827
01:06:34,915 --> 01:06:38,080
Don't pull that card, pal.
We don't kill kids.

828
01:06:38,105 --> 01:06:41,288
I kill for 2 reasons.
Money and necessity.

829
01:06:41,592 --> 01:06:45,773
I don't kill for pleasure.
I never have, I never will.

830
01:06:45,798 --> 01:06:47,396
Well, why don't we
roll out Jerry Baker

831
01:06:47,421 --> 01:06:49,736
and ask him how
he feels about that, huh?

832
01:06:49,761 --> 01:06:53,728
I was... an intimidation tactic,
pure and simple.

833
01:06:55,404 --> 01:06:59,681
And I'm going to do whatever is necessary
to get a hold of that girl, you know that.

834
01:07:00,506 --> 01:07:02,545
She's got to go.

835
01:07:05,298 --> 01:07:09,366
You don't look the devil in the face
without taking the ride to the bottom floor

836
01:07:10,303 --> 01:07:12,090
The devil.

837
01:07:12,935 --> 01:07:15,779
You really are fucked in the head,
you know that?

838
01:07:15,878 --> 01:07:18,613
Ha.
So, now, I'm crazy, huh?

839
01:07:21,315 --> 01:07:23,594
Well, one of us must be.

840
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,769
Carter.

841
01:07:53,725 --> 01:07:56,372
What?
You okay?

842
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,639
What's the matter?

843
01:08:11,567 --> 01:08:14,901
I'm sorry I got you into this.

844
01:08:16,981 --> 01:08:19,506
Got me into this.

845
01:08:21,286 --> 01:08:22,994
Bird.

846
01:08:23,992 --> 01:08:25,344
Hey.

847
01:08:25,428 --> 01:08:26,857
Hey.

848
01:08:28,425 --> 01:08:31,490
We're put together for a reason.

849
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:41,279
Lucky.

850
01:09:51,305 --> 01:09:53,424
What took you so long?

851
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:05,784
Hey, partner!

852
01:10:06,021 --> 01:10:08,102
Got somebody down here
who wants to talk to you.

853
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:10,163
Go on, speak up, darling.

854
01:10:13,241 --> 01:10:14,547
Carter.

855
01:10:14,584 --> 01:10:16,171
Mara?

856
01:10:16,576 --> 01:10:19,994
Bingo!
Found her number in your phone.

857
01:10:20,078 --> 01:10:21,798
Gave her a call.

858
01:10:22,039 --> 01:10:25,072
I told her I was a friend of yours.

859
01:10:25,097 --> 01:10:28,529
And I was really worry about you.

860
01:10:31,558 --> 01:10:33,199
That you needed to
see her bad but

861
01:10:33,224 --> 01:10:35,979
you couldn't bring yourself
to make the call.

862
01:10:36,153 --> 01:10:37,711
That's where I come in.

863
01:10:37,736 --> 01:10:40,808
Being the close
loyal friend that I am.

864
01:10:40,833 --> 01:10:42,794
This poor woman drove
half the night to get here,

865
01:10:42,819 --> 01:10:44,395
ain't that right, ma'am?

866
01:10:45,978 --> 01:10:48,029
Carter, I'm sorry.

867
01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:51,381
He told me you were drinking,
I was worried about you.

868
01:10:51,406 --> 01:10:53,053
- You hush now, you hear?
- I'm sorry.

869
01:10:53,131 --> 01:10:54,658
So, what's it gonna be, sergeant Greene?

870
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:56,501
Looks like we got
our tie breaker, huh?

871
01:10:56,526 --> 01:10:58,521
If you fucking hurt her, man!

872
01:10:58,552 --> 01:11:00,724
I swear to fucking Christ,

873
01:11:00,749 --> 01:11:04,440
you'll never get this kid.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

874
01:11:04,766 --> 01:11:07,398
Somehow, I doubt that, soldier boy.

875
01:11:07,423 --> 01:11:10,808
Well, besides,
she ain't seen my face yet.

876
01:11:11,128 --> 01:11:12,654
Have you, darling?

877
01:11:12,748 --> 01:11:14,060
No.

878
01:11:14,085 --> 01:11:16,818
Just like our old friend, Jerry Baker.
You remember him?

879
01:11:16,843 --> 01:11:18,609
That's right. If you don't send
the kid down here,

880
01:11:18,634 --> 01:11:20,225
she's going to get the same thing.

881
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:22,697
This time, I'm not
going to be soft about it.

882
01:11:22,722 --> 01:11:24,373
You understand?

883
01:11:24,398 --> 01:11:27,537
I'm gonna do some real exploring.

884
01:11:28,094 --> 01:11:31,020
Really open her up,
see what she can do.

885
01:11:31,711 --> 01:11:33,083
So, you get your mind right,

886
01:11:33,115 --> 01:11:35,927
you send the girl
down here with that film,

887
01:11:35,952 --> 01:11:37,282
and you can have your wife back,

888
01:11:37,307 --> 01:11:39,579
and you all can get on back
to your happily ever after.

889
01:11:39,604 --> 01:11:41,676
How do I know I can trust you?

890
01:11:41,701 --> 01:11:43,418
You can't.

891
01:11:43,734 --> 01:11:47,469
But, if she was my wife,
I'll take the chance just the same.

892
01:11:47,494 --> 01:11:49,767
And seeing this how
we're here on your property,

893
01:11:49,792 --> 01:11:51,226
I'm gonna be real courteous and

894
01:11:51,251 --> 01:11:53,308
I'm gonna give you
to the count of five.

895
01:11:53,962 --> 01:11:55,675
Carter.

896
01:11:56,018 --> 01:11:57,590
Here we go.

897
01:11:59,003 --> 01:12:01,257
Carter, you promised.

898
01:12:01,282 --> 01:12:02,680
Five!

899
01:12:06,523 --> 01:12:08,435
Clock's ticking.

900
01:12:12,857 --> 01:12:14,794
Carter, please.

901
01:12:14,819 --> 01:12:17,063
Carter, please.
You promised.

902
01:12:17,088 --> 01:12:18,915
- Four!
- You promised.

903
01:12:19,253 --> 01:12:20,423
- Shhh.
- Please.

904
01:12:20,448 --> 01:12:21,633
Shut up!

905
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:26,549
Here, you take this.

906
01:12:26,574 --> 01:12:27,870
Don't take too long.

907
01:12:27,895 --> 01:12:31,349
If he tries to come up 'em stairs,
you shoot him.

908
01:12:31,374 --> 01:12:33,198
It will knock you on your ass,
but, you'll hit him

909
01:12:33,223 --> 01:12:35,729
if you just aim downstairs, okay?

910
01:12:35,754 --> 01:12:37,181
It aims real wide.

911
01:12:37,206 --> 01:12:38,165
Three!

912
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:40,443
What? No.
What are you doing?

913
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:44,914
I'm going to go see my son.

914
01:12:46,973 --> 01:12:48,635
Carter.

915
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:49,683
Shhh.

916
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:51,011
Two!

917
01:12:53,351 --> 01:12:56,396
Come on, sergeant Greene,
don't be stupid.

918
01:12:58,696 --> 01:12:59,998
Alright, that's it.
One.

919
01:13:00,023 --> 01:13:02,081
- Carter.
- Alright!

920
01:13:02,106 --> 01:13:03,374
Okay.

921
01:13:03,399 --> 01:13:05,696
You make the right choice.

922
01:13:06,376 --> 01:13:07,638
I'm proud of you.

923
01:13:07,663 --> 01:13:09,908
Alright, you come on.
You send her down.

924
01:13:10,363 --> 01:13:12,501
You can have your wife.

925
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:19,643
Carter.

926
01:13:20,257 --> 01:13:21,981
Are you okay?

927
01:13:22,006 --> 01:13:23,565
- Are you okay...
- Shhh!

928
01:13:26,111 --> 01:13:29,536
Well, not that it ain't
nice to see your ugly mug.

929
01:13:29,561 --> 01:13:33,068
But, what the fuck are you doing?

930
01:13:33,093 --> 01:13:34,315
I couldn't do it, man.

931
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:36,103
I can't send that little girl down here.

932
01:13:36,128 --> 01:13:38,617
I can see that!
Where's the 20 gauge?

933
01:13:38,642 --> 01:13:40,303
She's got it.

934
01:13:40,488 --> 01:13:42,054
You want her?

935
01:13:43,097 --> 01:13:44,895
Go get her.

936
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,517
Are you fucking kidding me?

937
01:13:46,542 --> 01:13:50,122
All she's got to do,
is aim down that stairwell

938
01:13:50,147 --> 01:13:51,569
and pull the fucking trigger, man.

939
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:53,553
You're drunk, 
you're slow.

940
01:13:53,578 --> 01:13:55,663
It'll be like shooting 
a fish in a barrel.

941
01:13:55,688 --> 01:13:57,387
That's brilliant.

942
01:13:57,649 --> 01:14:00,207
That's fucking brilliant, soldier boy.

943
01:14:00,418 --> 01:14:03,201
Just go home. 
Go home to your daughter.

944
01:14:03,226 --> 01:14:06,444
I don't have a fucking daughter!
I fucking hate kids!

945
01:14:06,469 --> 01:14:09,262
What the fuck does it matter, man? 
You win.

946
01:14:09,287 --> 01:14:10,696
You fucking coward!

947
01:14:10,721 --> 01:14:13,307
You didn't have the balls 
to make the call, did you?

948
01:14:13,331 --> 01:14:14,172
No!

949
01:14:14,197 --> 01:14:16,304
You give up your responsibility
to the little girl.

950
01:14:16,329 --> 01:14:20,576
And you came crawling down here
with your dick in your fucking hand

951
01:14:20,601 --> 01:14:23,064
to grovel like a dog for mercy!

952
01:14:23,089 --> 01:14:25,090
Fuck you. 
I don't do mercy!

953
01:14:25,115 --> 01:14:27,145
I'm gonna do you
both a favor and

954
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:30,620
end your miserable 
fucking lives right now!

955
01:14:30,645 --> 01:14:32,298
Hold on!

956
01:14:32,323 --> 01:14:35,477
Oh, come on, man. 
What the hell is that gonna solve, huh?

957
01:14:35,502 --> 01:14:37,226
I thought you didn't
kill for pleasure.

958
01:14:37,251 --> 01:14:40,065
Ain't you been listening?
Huh?

959
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:43,745
Have I been talking on my ass 
all mother fucking day

960
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:48,250
I'd have told you I have prostate cancer,
if I thought it would help.

961
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:50,419
- We haven't seen your face,
- Oh, no?

962
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:52,248
Well, here!
Now, you have.

963
01:14:52,273 --> 01:14:54,578
Nice to fucking meet you.

964
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:56,327
Carter!

965
01:14:56,964 --> 01:14:58,670
Time's up, girl.

966
01:14:58,695 --> 01:15:01,698
You need to bring your ass down here, 
before I killed your brand new daddy.

967
01:15:01,723 --> 01:15:03,322
No, Bird, no.

968
01:15:03,347 --> 01:15:05,907
You stay!
You, stay!

969
01:15:05,932 --> 01:15:08,389
Your choice, Princess.

970
01:15:08,611 --> 01:15:11,134
How many people got
to die because of you?

971
01:15:11,159 --> 01:15:15,128
She's just a kid for Christ sake.
There's no way.

972
01:15:19,068 --> 01:15:21,028
Atta girl, come to papa.

973
01:15:21,053 --> 01:15:24,917
Bird, no! You stay up there.
Go back!

974
01:15:24,942 --> 01:15:26,538
Oh, my god.

975
01:15:33,298 --> 01:15:34,360
Damn, girl.

976
01:15:34,385 --> 01:15:36,675
You know, you're about 
the toughest mark I ever had!

977
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,563
- Whoa.
- Bird, don't!

978
01:15:38,588 --> 01:15:39,870
What the?

979
01:15:53,373 --> 01:15:54,774
Come on, honey.

980
01:16:04,375 --> 01:16:07,200
Honey, get back here.
Where're you going?

981
01:16:18,617 --> 01:16:21,385
We need help, right away.
Please come, right away.

982
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:30,202
He's been shot.

983
01:16:31,107 --> 01:16:33,377
We need an ambulance, right away.

984
01:16:34,269 --> 01:16:36,157
Hi, pumpkin.

985
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:40,977
Scary, huh?

986
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:45,413
No.

987
01:16:51,394 --> 01:16:52,750
Do it.

988
01:16:55,916 --> 01:16:57,316
Do it.

989
01:17:07,524 --> 01:17:09,667
A fucking dud?

990
01:17:14,422 --> 01:17:19,739
All this god damn time.
A fucking dud.

991
01:17:30,301 --> 01:17:32,271
Just do it.

992
01:17:36,997 --> 01:17:39,553
What do you think I am?

993
01:17:41,705 --> 01:17:45,495
Some kind of monster?

994
01:18:21,186 --> 01:18:22,702
Carter?

995
01:18:34,773 --> 01:18:36,973
Carter, please.

996
01:18:47,002 --> 01:18:48,623
Please.

997
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:54,750
Please, what?

998
01:19:07,745 --> 01:19:09,632
Where's your camera?

999
01:19:11,787 --> 01:19:14,187
I guess I took it off.

1000
01:19:17,415 --> 01:19:19,387
I guess you did.

1001
01:19:22,592 --> 01:19:24,784
You saved me.

1002
01:19:30,501 --> 01:19:33,093
I just returned a favor.

1003
01:19:37,683 --> 01:19:40,083
You're going to be okay, right?

1004
01:19:41,397 --> 01:19:43,522
Don't you worry.

1005
01:19:44,141 --> 01:19:46,627
There ain't no quitting me.
