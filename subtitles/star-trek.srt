00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,800
- USS Kelvin, go for Starfleet base.
- Starfleet Base.

3
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,700
We sent you a transmission.
Did you receive it?

4
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,300
Kelvin, can you double-check those readings?

5
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,000
Our gravitational sensors are going crazy
here. You should see this.

6
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,500
It looks like a lightning storm.

7
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,200
What you've sent us doesn't seem possible.

8
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,400
Yes mam, I understand.
That's why we sent it.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,500
- Report.
- Still out of visual range. 20 seconds.

10
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,900
Alert captain Robau that Starfleet 
advised to proceed with caution ...

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,400
Polarize the view screen.

12
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,000
- Whatever this is... Klingon origin?
- Captain, we have visual.

13
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,200
- Repeat. Could this be Klingon?
- Negative, lieutenant.

14
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,200
You're 75 000 kilometers
from the Klingon border.

15
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,500
Captain, are you seeing this?

16
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,500
My God.

17
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,000
I have a reading.
They've locked weapons on us!

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,100
Red alert!

19
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,800
Torpedo locked on us at 320°- 2!
Arm weapons!

20
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,200
Evasive pattern delta 5!

21
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,700
We're being cut like grass.

22
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,400
Fire all phasers!
Damage report.

23
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,200
Warp drive's been knocked out.
Never seen anything like this.

24
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,700
Weapons offline.
Main power at 38%.

25
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,000
- They're firing another!
- All power to forward shields!

26
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,700
Help me ...

27
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,900
... maneuver has been lost.

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Are shields even on?

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
... decks 17 and 13, we have
confirmed casualties.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,600
11% and dropping. 10%.
Shields at 9%.

31
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,700
All remaining power to forward shields.

32
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,600
Prepare shuttles for evacuation.

33
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,300
Hello.

34
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,900
My commander requests the presence of
your captain

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,500
in order to negotiate a ceasefire.

36
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:30,100
You will come aboard our ship via shuttlecraft.
Your refusal would be unwise.

37
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,500
Walk with me.

38
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,700
If I don't report in 15 minutes
evacuate the crew.

39
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,600
- Sir, we could ...
- There is no outpost out here.

40
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,400
Use autopilot and get off this ship.

41
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,900
Aye captain.

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,300
You're captain now, Mr. Kirk.

43
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,100
His heart rate is elevated.

44
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,700
Look at the ship.

45
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,800
- Are you familiar with this craft?
- Who is your commander?

46
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,900
- Is that him?
- I will speak for captain Nero.

47
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,800
Then ask captain Nero:
What gives him the right to attack a Federation vessel.

48
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,100
Do you know the location of
ambassador Spock?

49
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,300
I'm unfamiliar with
ambassador Spock.

50
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,900
- What is the current star date?
- Star date?

51
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,300
2233.04.

52
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,000
Where are you from?

53
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,600
Terminated.

54
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,500
- Sir, they have a lock on our signal.
- They're launching again.

55
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,200
Bravo 6 maneuver fire, full spread!

56
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,400
I'm initiating general order 13, 
we're evacuating!

57
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,300
Sir.

58
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,200
All decks, this is the captain speaking,
evacuate the ship immediately.

59
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,500
Get your ... to the shuttlecraft.
Begin evacuating ...

60
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,100
- That's George's voice. What's happening?
- We'll deliver it in the shuttle. Go!

61
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,600
- George.
- You're OK, thank God.

62
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,900
I have medical shuttle 37 standing by.
Get to it now. Can you do that?

63
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,500
- Yes.
- Everything's gonna be OK.

64
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,500
- Do exactly as I say, shuttle 37.
- George, it's coming.

65
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,700
- Our baby. It's coming now.
- I'm on my way.

66
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,800
Autopilot function has been destroyed.
Manual operation only.

67
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,700
Clear those decks now! Get to the shuttles!
Move! Move! Move!

68
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,900
- That was a big one!
- Just keep breathing. You'll be fine.

69
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
- And the baby too, right?
- And the baby too.

70
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,500
Right here.

71
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,300
Captain to shuttle 37.
Is my wife on board?

72
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,900
- Yes sir, she is.
- I need you to go now. Do you hear me?

73
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,800
- We're waiting on you sir.
- No, just go, take off immediately.

74
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,000
- That's an order.
- Yes sir.

75
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,100
Wait. We're not going yet.

76
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,100
Please stop.

77
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,000
George, the shuttle's leaving. 
Where are you?

78
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,900
Sweetheart, listen to me.
I'm not gonna be there.

79
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
- No.
- This is the only way you'll survive.

80
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,500
Please don't stay on the ship. 
Come to me here.

81
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,800
The shuttles will never make it 
if I don't fight them off.

82
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,700
George, I can't do this without you.

83
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,200
OK, I need you to push now!

84
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,700
SYSTEMS FAILING

85
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,400
COLLISION COURSE
ENGAGED

86
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,900
- What is it?
- It's a boy.

87
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,800
A boy?

88
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,000
- Tell me about him.
- He's beautiful.

89
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,200
George, you should be here.

90
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,100
Impact alert.

91
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,100
- What are we gonna call him?
- We can name him after your father.

92
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,500
Tiberius, you kiddin' me?
No, that's the worst.

93
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,200
Let's name him after your dad.
Let's call him Jim.

94
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,000
Jim. OK. Jim it is.

95
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,800
- Sweetheart can you hear me?
- I can hear...

96
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,500
I love you so much.

97
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,200
I love you!

98
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:53,200
STAR TREK

99
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,900
Hey, are you out of your mind?
That car is an antique.

100
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,200
You think you can get away with this
just because your mother's off planet.

101
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:29,500
You get your ass back home now! You live in my
house buddy. You live in my house and that's my car.

102
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,000
You get one scratch on that car
and I'm gonna whip your ass ...

103
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,200
Hey Johnny!

104
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,800
Citizen, pull over.

105
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,700
Noooo...!

106
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,500
Is there a problem officer?

107
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,500
Citizen, what is your name?

108
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,900
My name is James Tiberius Kirk.

109
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,500
- What is the formula for the volume of a sphere?
- 4/3 PI times the radius cubed ...

110
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,900
1.26 ...

111
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
- What is the dimensionality ...
- Dimensionality equals the logarithm of n divided by ...

112
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,100
... non-excludability and non-rivalry ...

113
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,100
... 4/3 PI times the radius ...

114
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,000
... is morally praiseworthy
but not morally obligatory.

115
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,200
Spock.

116
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,100
I presume you've prepared new insults for today?

117
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,500
Affirmative.

118
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,600
This is your 35th attempt to illicit 
an emotional response from me.

119
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,400
You're neither Human nor Vulcan and
therefore have no place in this universe.

120
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,600
Look, his Human eyes.
They look sad. Don't they.

121
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,900
Perhaps an emotional response
requires physical stimulae.

122
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,000
He's a traitor you know? Your father.

123
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,800
For marrying her. That Human whore.

124
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,200
They called you a traitor.

125
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,300
Emotions run deep within our race.

126
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,900
In many ways more deeply than in humans.

127
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,700
Logic offers a serenity humans
seldom experience.

128
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,300
The control of feelings ...
so that they do not control you.

129
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,900
You suggest that I should 
be completely Vulcan?

130
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,200
And yet you married a Human.

131
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,400
As ambassador to Earth it is my duty to
observe

132
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,300
and understand Human behavior.

133
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,200
Marrying your mother was ... logical.

134
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,300
Spock.

135
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,200
You are fully capable of deciding
your own destiny.

136
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:12,700
The question you face is:
Which path will you choose?

137
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,300
This is something only you can decide.

138
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,600
Spock. Come here, let me see you.

139
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,100
- No.
- Spock.

140
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,100
There's no need to be anxious.
You'll do fine.

141
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,400
I am hardly anxious, mother.

142
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,800
And fine has variable definitions,
fine is unacceptable.
- OK.

143
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,600
- May I ask a personal query?
- Anything.

144
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,200
Should I choose to complete the Vulcan
discipline of Kolinahr.

145
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,000
and purge all emotion?

146
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,000
I trust you will not feel it reflects
judgment upon you.

147
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,000
Oh Spock.

148
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,800
As always, whatever you choose to be,
you will have a proud mother.

149
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,200
You have surpassed the expectations of
your instructors.

150
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,700
Your final record is flawless.
With one exception.

151
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,100
I see that you have applied to
Starfleet as well.

152
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,400
It was logical to cultivate more options.

153
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,100
Logical, but unnecessary. You are hereby
accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy.

154
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,700
It is truly remarkable Spock that you have
achieved so much

155
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,000
despite your disadvantage.

156
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,700
All rise.

157
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:08,300
If you would clarify, minister? To what
disadvantage are you referring?

158
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,000
Your Human mother.

159
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,200
Council, ministers, I must decline.

160
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,900
No Vulcan has ever declined
admission to this Academy.

161
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,800
But as I am half-human, your
record remains untarnished.

162
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,500
Spock, you have made a commitment
to honor the Vulcan way.

163
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,700
Why did you come before this
council today?

164
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,600
Was it to satisfy your emotional need
to rebel?

165
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,400
The only emotion I wish to convey
is gratitude.

166
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,800
Thank you, ministers,
for your consideration.

167
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,500
Live long and prosper.

168
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,600
- Hi.
- Hey there.

169
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,800
Hi. I'd like a Clabmin fire tea ...
3 Budweiser Classics,

170
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,200
2 Cardassian sunrises and ...

171
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,800
- Try the Slusho, it's good.
- A Slusho mix, thank you.

172
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,700
That's a lot of drinks for a woman.

173
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,000
- And a shot of Jack, straight up.
- Make that two. Her shot's on me.

174
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,500
Her shot's on her.
Thanks, but no thanks.

175
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,700
Don't you at least wanna know my name
before you completely reject me?

176
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,100
I'm fine without it.

177
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,500
You are fine without it. It's Jim, Jim Kirk.

178
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
If you don't tell me your name,
I'm gonna have to make one up.

179
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,200
- It's Uhura.
- Uhura? No way.

180
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,500
That's the name I was gonna make
up for you.

181
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,200
- Uhura what?
- Just Uhura.

182
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,300
- They don't have last names in your world?
- Uhura is my last name.

183
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,200
Well then you have ... your first name's Human?

184
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,500
- Excuse me buddy. - So, you're a cadet,
your studying. What's your focus?

185
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,100
Xenolinguistics.
You have no idea what that means.

186
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,600
The study of alien languages.
Morphology, phonology, syntax.

187
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
Means you've got a talented tongue.

188
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,400
I'm impressed.

189
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
For a moment there, I thought you were just
a dumb-hair colonial

190
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,500
who has sex with farm animals.

191
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,400
Well, not only.

192
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,500
This townie isn't bothering you, right?

193
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,500
Oh, beyond belief.
But it's nothing I can't handle.

194
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,600
You could've handled me.
That's an invitation.

195
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,100
- Hey. You better mind your manners.
- Oh relax cupcake, it was a joke.

196
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,900
Hey farm boy, maybe you can't count.

197
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,900
There are 4 of us and 1 of you.

198
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,200
So get some more guys and then it'll
be an even fight.

199
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,600
Guys. Stop it.

200
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,400
Stop it!

201
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,000
Enough!

202
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,300
Guys, he's had enough.

203
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,600
Outside. All of you.

204
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,000
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

205
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,200
- What ...
- I just bought a drink.

206
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,100
- You all right, son?
- You can whistle really loud, you know that?

207
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,100
You know I couldn't believe it when the
bartender told me who you are.

208
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,100
- Who the hell am I, captain Pike?
- Your father's son.

209
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,300
Can I get another one?

210
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,900
For my dissertation I was assigned USS Kelvin.

211
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,600
Something I admired about your dad, he didn't
believe in no-win scenarios.

212
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,600
- Sure learned his lesson.
- Well that depends on how you define winning.

213
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,400
You're here, aren't you?
- Thanks.

214
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You know that instinct to leap without looking,
that was his nature too

215
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,300
and in my opinion something Starfleet's lost.

216
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,300
Why are you talking to me man?

217
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,300
Because I looked up your file while
you were drooling on the floor.

218
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,000
Your aptitude tests are off the charts, so
what is it?

219
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,000
You like being the only genius level
repeat-offender in the mid-west?

220
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,500
Maybe I love it.

221
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,700
So your dad dies, you can saddle for
less than an ordinary life.

222
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,200
Or do you feel that you were meant for
something better? Something special?

223
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,400
- Enlist in Starfleet.
- Enlist?

224
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,600
You guys must be way down on your
recruiting quarter for the month.

225
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,500
If you're half the man your father was
Jim,

226
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,500
Starfleet could use you.

227
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,400
You can be an officer in 4 years,
you can have your own ship in 8.

228
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,600
You understand what the Federation is,
don't you? It's important,

229
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,500
It's a peacekeeping and humanitarian
armada.

230
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,700
We done?

231
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,000
I'm done.

232
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,300
Riverside shipyard. Shuttle for new
recruits leaves tomorrow - 08:00.

233
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,800
Your father was captain of a starship
for 12 minutes.

234
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:30,600
He saved 800 lives, including your
mother's and yours.

235
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,400
I dare you to do better.

236
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,500
Nice ride man.

237
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,800
It's yours.

238
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,200
4 years? I'll do it in 3.

239
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,100
At ease gentlemen.

240
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,200
Never did get that first name.

241
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,000
- You need a doctor.
- I told you people,

242
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I don't need a doctor,
damn it. I am a doctor.

243
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,600
- You need to get back to your seat.
- I had one, in the bathroom with no windows.

244
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,900
I suffer from aviofobia. That means fear
of dying in something that flies.

245
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,800
Sir, for your own safety, sit down or
else I'll make you sit down!

246
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,700
- Fine.
- Thank you.

247
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
This is captain Pike, we've been cleared
for takeoff.

248
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,600
I may throw up on you.

249
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,000
- I think these things are pretty safe.
- Don't pander with me kid.

250
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,500
One tiny crack in the hull and our blood
boils in 13 seconds.

251
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,100
A solar flare might crop up,
cook us in our seats.

252
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,400
And while you’re sitting pretty with a case
of Andorian shingles,

253
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,500
see if you're still so relaxed when your
eyeballs are bleeding.

254
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,700
Space is disease and danger, wrapped
in darkness and silence.

255
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,200
Well I hate to break this to you, but
Starfleet operates in space.

256
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:40,400
Yeah, well... I've got nowhere else to go, the ex
wife took the whole damn planet in the divorce.

257
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,400
All I've got left is my bones.

258
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,900
- Jim Kirk.
- McCoy. Leonard McCoy.

259
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,800
Three years later.

260
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,200
Captain Nero. You've been
requested on the bridge, sir.

261
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,800
Ayel says it's time.

262
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,600
Sir, we've arrived at the
coordinates we calculated.

263
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,100
There's nothing here. What
are your orders?

264
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,800
We wait.

265
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,000
We wait for the one who allowed
our home to be destroyed.

266
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,300
As we've been doing for 25 years.

267
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,000
- And once we've killed him?
- Kill him?

268
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,200
I'm not gonna kill him.
I gonna make him watch.

269
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,200
Capture that ship.

270
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,600
Welcome back, Spock.

271
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,800
- Why are you so happy?
- I do not know what you're talking about.

272
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,200
- No, I don't suppose you do.
- Hello ladies.

273
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,900
- I'm taking the test again.
- You've got to be kidding.

274
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,800
Yeah, tomorrow morning.
And I want you there.

275
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,100
You know I've got better things to do than
watch you embarrass yourself for the 3rd time.

276
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,600
I am a doctor, Jim. I'm busy.

277
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,900
Bones, it doesn't bother you that no one’s
ever passed the test.

278
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,900
Jim, it's Kobayashi Maru.
Nobody passes the test.

279
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,300
And no one goes back for seconds,
let alone thirds.

280
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,700
I've gotta study.

281
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,000
Study, my ass.

282
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,600
Jim, I think I love you.

283
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,000
- That is so weird.
- Lights.

284
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,100
- Did you just say that is so weird.
- Yeah, I did, but I ...

285
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,900
You don't love me too?

286
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,300
- Oh, no, my roommate.
- I thought you said she was gone for the night.

287
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,200
Obviously she's not. Quick, you've got ...
just get under the bed.

288
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,700
- Under ... ? - Look, just get under
the bed. She can't see you.

289
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,600
- Why not? - Because I promised her
I'd stop bringing guys back to the dorm.

290
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,700
- Well how... How many guys have you ...?
- Just d... just down.

291
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,200
- Hey.
- Hey. How are you?

292
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,600
- Good. - Strangest thing...

293
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,400
I was in the long range sensor lab.

294
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,200
Yeah, I thought all night...

295
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,800
I was tracking solar systems and I picked
up an emergency transmission.

296
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,700
- Really?
- Yeah.

297
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,700
From a Klingon prison planet.

298
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,000
- No.
- Yeah.

299
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,700
A Klingon armada was destroyed,
47 ships.

300
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,500
So, you're not going back to the
lab tonight?

301
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,400
- Gaila, who is he?
- Who's who?

302
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,500
The mouth-breather hiding under
your bed.

303
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,100
- You could hear me breathing?
- You.

304
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,300
- Big day tomorrow.
- You're gonna fail.

305
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,000
- Gail, see you around.
- Get out.

306
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,400
- If I pass will you tell me your first name?
- No. Good night.

307
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,300
I think the fact that you picked up
a transmission is very impress...

308
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,000
We're receiving a distress signal from
the USS Kobayashi Maru.

309
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,300
The ship has lost power and is
stranded.

310
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,300
Starfleet command has ordered
us to rescue them.

311
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Starfleet command has ordered
us to rescue them ... captain.

312
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,800
Two Klingon vessels have entered the neutral
zone and are locking weapons on us.

313
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,800
- That's OK.
- That's OK?

314
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,600
Yeah, don't worry about it.

315
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,900
- Did he say don't worry about it?
- Is he not taking the simulation seriously?

316
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,800
Three more Klingon war birds decloaking
and targeting our ship.

317
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,700
- I don't suppose this is a problem either?
- They're firing, captain.

318
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,800
Alert medical bay to prepare to receive

319
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,700
all crew members from the damaged ship

320
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,600
And how do you expect us to rescue them
when we're surrounded by Klingons, captain?

321
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,000
Alert medical.

322
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,000
- Our ship is being hit. Shields at 60%.
- I understand.

323
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,600
Should we, I don't know, fight back?

324
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,400
- No.
- Of course not.

325
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,200
What is this? What's going on?

326
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,400
Hm. Arm photons. Prepare to fire
on the Klingon war birds.

327
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,700
- Yes, sir.
- Jim, their shields are still up.

328
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,000
Are they?

329
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,600
- No, they're not.
- Fire on all enemy ships.

330
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,200
One photon each should do
let's not waste ammunition.

331
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,400
Target locked an acquired on all war birds.

332
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,100
Firing.

333
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,700
All ships destroyed, captain.

334
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,000
Begin rescue of the stranded crew.

335
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,200
So, we've managed to eliminate all
enemy ships,

336
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,200
no one on board was injured,

337
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:00,800
and the successful rescue of the
Kobayashi Maru crew is under way.

338
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,800
How the hell did that kid beat your test?

339
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,000
I do not know.

340
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,300
This session has been called to resolve a
troubling matter.

341
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,000
James T. Kirk, step forward.

342
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,600
Cadet Kirk, evidence has been submitted
to this council,

343
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,600
suggesting that you violated the
ethical code of conduct

344
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,000
pursuing to regulation 17.43
of the Starfleet code.

345
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,400
Is there anything you care to say
before we begin, sir?

346
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,000
Yes. I believe I have the right
to face my accuser directly?

347
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,500
Step forward please.

348
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,300
This is commander Spock. He is one
of our most distinguished graduates.

349
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,200
He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru
exam for the last 4 years.

350
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,500
Commander.

351
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,100
Cadet Kirk, you somehow managed to install
and activate a subroutine

352
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,000
in the programming code, thereby changing the
conditions of the test.

353
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,700
- Your point being?
- In academic vernacular - you cheated.

354
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,600
Let me ask you something I think we all
know the answer to.

355
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,400
The test itself is a cheat, isn't it?
You programmed it to be unwinnable.

356
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,400
Your argument precludes the ability
of a no-win scenario?

357
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,700
I don't believe in no-win scenarios.

358
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,200
Then not only did you violate the rules, you
also failed to understand the principle lesson.

359
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,700
Please, enlighten me.

360
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,100
You of all people should know, cadet
Kirk, a captain cannot cheat death.

361
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,800
- I of all people?
- Your father,

362
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,700
lt. George Kirk assumed command of his vessel
before being killed in action, did he not?

363
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,100
- I don't think you like the fact that I beat your test.
- Further more you have failed to define the purpose of the test

364
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,100
- Enlighten me again.
- The purpose to experience fear.

365
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,800
Fear in the face of certain death.
To accept that fear

366
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,400
and maintain control of oneself
and one's crew.

367
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,800
This is a quality expected in
every Starfleet captain.

368
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,300
Excuse me, sir.

369
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,100
We've received a distress
call from Vulcan.

370
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,400
With our primary fleet engaged
in the Laurentian system,

371
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,000
I hereby order all cadets to report
to hangar 1 immediately.

372
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,100
Dismissed.

373
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,300
- Who was that pointy-eared bastard?
- I do not know.

374
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,300
But I like him.

375
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,200
Bracer, USS Farragut.

376
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,600
McCoy, USS Enterprise.
McGrath, USS Walcott.

377
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,100
Spader, USS Hood.

378
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,900
Welcome to Starfleet.
Godspeed.

379
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
He didn't call my name.

380
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:56,600
Commander, sir, you didn't call
my name, Kirk, James T.

381
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,800
Kirk, you're on academic suspension,
that means you're grounded

382
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,000
until the academy board rules.

383
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,600
Jim, the board will rule in your favor.

384
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,600
Most likely.

385
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,600
Look Jim, I've gotta go.

386
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,700
Yeah. Yeah, go. Be safe.

387
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,700
- Excuse me.
- Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.

388
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,900
Damn it.

389
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,900
Come with me.

390
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,400
Uhura, USS Farragut.
Petrovsky, USS Antares.

391
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500
Go to your stations and good luck.

392
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,200
- Bones, where are we going?
- You'll see.

393
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,600
- Commander, a word?
- Yes, lieutenant?

394
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,900
- Was I not one of your top students?
- Indeed you were.

395
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,100
And did I not on multiple occasions
demonstrate an exceptional oral sensitivity

396
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,800
and I quote "an unparalleled ability
to identify sonic anomalies

397
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,700
in subspace transmission tests"?

398
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,200
Consistently, yes.

399
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,700
And while you were well aware that I'm qualified
and desire to serve on the USS Enterprise,

400
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,700
I'm assigned to the Farragut?

401
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,900
It was an attempt to avoid
the appearance of favoritism.

402
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,100
No. I'm assigned to the Enterprise.

403
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,300
- Yes, I believe you are.
- Thank you.

404
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,800
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing you a favor.

405
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,800
I couldn’t just leave you there
looking all pathetic. Take a seat.

406
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,700
Let me give you a vaccine
against viral infection

407
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,400
from the Ovaran mud flies.

408
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,000
- What for?
- To give you the symptoms.

409
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,200
- What are you talking about? - You're
gonna start to lose vision in your left eye.

410
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,700
Yeah, I already have.

411
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,300
Oh, and you're gonna get a really bad
headache and flop sweat.

412
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,300
- You call this a favor?
- Yeah, you owe me one.

413
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,700
Kirk, James T. He is not cleared
for duty aboard the Enterprise.

414
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,700
Medical code states the treatment and
transport of a patient is to be determined

415
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,600
at the discretion of his attending physician.

416
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,500
Which is me. S I'm taking Mr. Kirk aboard.

417
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,000
Or you would you like to explain to
captain Pike

418
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:09,200
why Enterprise warped into a crisis
without one of its senior medical officers?

419
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,700
- As you were.
- As you were. Come on.

420
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,500
I might throw up on you.

421
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,300
Jim, you've gotta look at this.

422
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,900
- Jim, look.
- What?

423
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,800
We need to get you changed.

424
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,000
I don't feel right. I feel like I'm leaking.

425
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,100
Damn, it's that pointy-eared bastard.

426
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,200
- Mr. Spock.
- Captain.

427
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,600
- Engineering reports ready for launch.
- Thank you.

428
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,200
Ladies and gentlemen, the maiden
voyage of our newest flagship

429
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,900
deserves more pompon circumstance
that we can afford today.

430
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,300
The christening will just have to
be our reward for a safe return.

431
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,100
Carry on.

432
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,800
All decks, this is Captain Pike.
Prepare for immediate departure.

433
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,200
Helm, thrusters.

434
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,600
??? retracted, captain, dock
control reports ready.

435
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,300
Thrusters fired.
Separating from space dock.

436
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,600
The fleet's cleared space dock, captain.
All ships ready for warp.

437
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,200
- Set course for Vulcan.
- Aye-aye, captain.

438
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,800
Course laid in.

439
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,700
Maximum warp. Punch it.

440
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,900
- Lieutenant, where's helmsmen McKenna?
- He has lung worms sir.

441
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,800
He couldn't report to his post.

442
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,000
- I'm Hikaru Sulu.
- And you are a pilot, right?

443
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:15,000
Very much so, sir. I'm ...
I'm not sure what's wrong here.

444
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,900
Is the parking brake on?

445
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,500
No.

446
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,500
I figured it out, I'm just...

447
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,700
Have you disengaged the external
inertial dampener?

448
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,100
- Ready for warp, sir.
- Let's punch it.

449
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,100
- Where are we?
- Medical bay.

450
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
- This isn't worth it.
- A little suffering's good for the soul.

451
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,200
Hi, how are you?

452
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,500
- My mouth is itchy. Is that normal?
- Well, those symptoms won't last long.

453
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,700
- I'm going to give you a mild sedative.
- Oh, I wish I didn't know you.

454
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,600
Don't be such an infant.

455
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,600
How long is it supposed to...

456
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,700
Unbelievable.

457
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,200
Engines at maximum warp captain.

458
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,500
Russian whiz kid, what's your name?
Cheikov? Chirpov?

459
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,800
- Ensign Chekov, Pavel Andrejevic, sir.
- Fine.

460
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,600
Chekov, Pavel Andrejevic,
begin ship wide mission broadcast.

461
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,600
Yes, sir. Happy to.

462
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,100
Ensign authorization code
95 Wictor Wictor 2.

463
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,300
Authorization not recognized.

464
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:21,700
Ensign authorization code
95 Victor Victor 2.

465
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,300
Access granted.

466
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,800
May I have your attention please.

467
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,800
At 22:00, telemetry detected an anomaly
in the neutral zone.

468
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,500
What appeared to be a lightning
storm in space.

469
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:41,400
Soon after, Starfleet received a distress
signal from the Vulcan high command

470
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:45,300
that their planet was experiencing
seismic activity.

471
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,200
Our mission is to assess the
condition of Vulcan

472
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,800
and assist in evacuations
if necessary.

473
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:58,000
We should be arriving at Vulcan within
3 minutes. Thank you for your time.

474
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,500
Lightning storm.

475
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,200
Aah Jim, you're awake. How do you feel?

476
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,800
- Good God, man!
- What? Aah!

477
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
- What the hell's this?
- A reaction to the vaccine. Damn it.

478
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,800
Nurse Chapel, I need 50cc
of cortisone.

479
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,900
Yes, sir.

480
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,700
May I ... Appeared to be
a lightning storm in space.

481
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,300
We've gotta stop the ship.

482
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,800
Jim. I'm not kidding. You need
to keep your heart rate down.

483
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,800
Computer, locate crew member Uhura.

484
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,100
I haven't seen a reaction this
severe since medical school.

485
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,000
- We're flying into a trap!
- Damn it, Jim! Stand still.

486
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,200
Stop it!

487
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,100
- Uhura.
- Kirk. What are you doing here?

488
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,200
Transmission from the Klingon prison
planet, what exactly did it say?

489
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:56,400
- Oh my God, what's wrong with your hands?
- Who is responsible for the Klingon attack?

490
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,400
- Was the ship Romu...?
- Was the ship what?

491
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,000
- What's happening to my mouth?
- You got numb tongue?

492
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,200
- Numb tongue?!
- I can fix that.

493
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,800
- Was the ship what?
- Romulan.

494
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,200
- What?
- Romulan.

495
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,300
- Romulan? - Yeah.
- Yes. - Yeah!

496
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,900
Prod Nero seven Federation
ships are on their way.

497
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,200
- Jim!
- What's going on?

498
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,000
- Jim, come back.
- Captain!

499
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,000
Captain Pike, sir, we have to stop the ship.

500
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,400
Kirk, how the hell did you get
on board the Enterprise?

501
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,800
- Captain, this man is under the influence of a
severe reaction to a vaccine. - Bones, plea...

502
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,000
... He's completely delusional ...

503
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,500
Vulcan is not a experiencing a natural disaster,
it's being attacked by Romulans.

504
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,900
Romulans? Cadet Kirk, I think you've
had enough attention for one day

505
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,500
McCoy, take him back to medical.
We'll have words later.

506
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,300
- Aye captain.
- Sir, that same anomaly ...

507
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,400
Mr. Kirk is not cleared to be
aboard this vessel, captain...

508
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,800
Look, I get it, you're a great ...

509
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,400
I'd love to do it again with you soon ...

510
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,000
- I can remove the cadet ...
- Try it!

511
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,600
This cadet is trying to save the bridge!

512
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,600
By recommending a full stop mid-warp
doing a rescue mission?

513
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,400
It's not a rescue mission.
Listen to me. It's an attack.

514
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,600
Based on what facts?

515
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:33,100
That same anomaly,
a lightning storm in space

516
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,100
that we saw today, also occurred
on the day of my birth.

517
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,100
Before a Romulan ship attacked
the USS Kelvin.

518
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,300
You know that, sir.
I've read your dissertation.

519
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,800
That ship, which had formidable and
advanced weaponry

520
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,700
was never seen or heard from again.

521
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,800
The Kelvin attacked a place on
the edge of Klingon space.

522
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,400
And at 23:00 last night
there was an attack.

523
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,300
47 Klingon war birds destroyed
by Romulans, sir.

524
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,500
And it was reported that the Romulans
were in one ship, one massive ship.

525
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,000
And you know of this Klingon attack how?

526
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,700
Sir, I intercepted and translated
the message myself.

527
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,100
- Kirk's report is accurate.
- We're warping into a trap, sir.

528
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,600
The Romulans are waiting for us.
I promise you that.

529
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,900
The cadet's logic is sound.

530
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:18,400
And lt. Uhura's is unmatched in xenolinguistics.
We would be wise to accept her conclusion.

531
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,500
Scan Vulcan space. Check for
any transmissions in Romulan.

532
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,700
Sir, I'm not sure I can distinguish the
Romulan language from Vulcan.

533
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,100
What about you?
Do you speak Romulan, cadet?

534
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,800
Uhura. All 3 dialects, sir.

535
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,900
- Uhura, relieve the lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

536
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,500
Hannity, hail the USS Truman.

537
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,200
All the other ships are out of warp
sir and have arrived at Vulcan,

538
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,400
but we seem to have lost all contact.

539
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:43,000
Sir, I pick up no Romulan transmission
or transmission of any kind in the area.

540
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,500
It's because they're being attacked.

541
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,400
Shields up. Red alert.

542
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,100
Arrival at Vulcan
in 5 seconds.

543
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,500
4 ... 3 .... 2 ...

544
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,100
- Emergency evasives.
- Running, sir.

545
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,700
- Damage report.
- Deflector shields are holding.

546
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,900
All stations.
Engineering, Olson, report.

547
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,600
Full reverse. Come about starboard, 90°.

548
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,300
Drop us down underneath them, Sulu.

549
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,700
- Sir, there's another Federation ship.
- Destroy it too.

550
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,800
Fire torpedoes.

551
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,000
Captain, they're locking torpedoes.

552
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,700
Divert auxiliary power from port
nossel to forward shields.

553
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,900
- Sulu, status report.
- Shields at 32%.

554
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,200
Their weapons are powerful, sir.
We can't take another hit like that.

555
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,000
- Get me Starfleet command.
- Captain.

556
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,800
The Romulan ship has lowered some
kind of high energy pulse device

557
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,100
into the Vulcan atmosphere.

558
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,900
It's signal appears to be blocking our
communications and transporter abilities.

559
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,200
All power to forward shields.
Prepare to fire all weapons.

560
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,100
Weapons ready.

561
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,500
Wait!

562
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,900
- Gohol, magnify!
- Yes, sir.

563
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,300
Captain, we're being hailed.

564
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,900
Hello.

565
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,000
I am the captain Christopher Pike.
To whom am I speaking?

566
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,300
Hi Christopher. I am Nero.

567
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,500
You've declared war against the Federation.
Withdraw

568
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,800
and I'll agree to arrange a conference with
Romulan leadership at a neutral location.

569
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:56,000
I do not speak for the Empire.
We stand apart.

570
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:01,000
As does your Vulcan crew member.
Isn't that right, Spock?

571
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,600
Pardon me, I do not believe that
you and I are acquainted.

572
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,200
No, we're not.

573
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,900
Not yet.

574
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,400
Spock, there's something I
would like you to see.

575
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,000
Captain Pike, your transporter
has been disabled.

576
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,900
As you can see, by the rest of
the armada, you have no choice.

577
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,700
You will man a shuttle. Come aboard
the Narada for negotiations.

578
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,300
That is all.

579
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,000
- They’ll kill you, you know that.
- Your survival is unlikely.

580
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,700
Captain, we gain nothing
by diplomacy.

581
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,000
Going over to that ship is a mistake.

582
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,100
- I too agree. You should rethink your strategy.
- I understand that.

583
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,200
I need officers who've been trained in
advanced hand to hand combat.

584
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,600
I have training, sir.

585
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,000
Come with me.

586
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,100
Kirk, you too. You're not supposed
to be here anyway.

587
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,000
- Chekov, you have the con.
- Aye, Captain.

588
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,800
Prepare the red matter.

589
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,800
Yes, sir.

590
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,500
Without transporters we can't beam off the ship.

591
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,500
We can't assist Vulcan.
We can't do our job.

592
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,500
Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu and engineer Olson
will space-jump from the shuttle.

593
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,700
You will land on that machine
they've lowered into the atmosphere

594
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,900
that's scrambling our gear. You'll get
inside, you'll disable it

595
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,600
then you'll beam back to the ship.

596
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,500
Mr. Spock, I'm leaving you in
command of the Enterprise.

597
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,700
Once we have transport capability
and communication back up

598
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,300
you'll contact Starfleet and report
what the hell's going on here.

599
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,700
And if all else fails, fall back

600
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,800
and rendezvous with the fleet
in the Laurentian system.

601
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,300
Kirk, I'm promoting you to first officer.

602
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,600
- What?
- Captain?

603
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,800
Please, I apologize. The complexities
of Human pranks escape me.

604
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,000
It's not a prank, Spock.

605
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,700
And I am not the captain, you are.

606
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,100
Let's go.

607
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,300
Sir, after we knock out that drill,
what happens to you?

608
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,700
I guess you have to come and get me.

609
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,200
Careful with the ship, Spock.
She's brand new.

610
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,900
- Dr. Puri, report.
- It's McCoy.

611
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,600
Doctor Puri was on deck 6.
He's dead.

612
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,700
Then you have just inherited his
responsibility as chief medical officer.

613
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,000
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

614
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,600
Shuttle 89, USS Enterprise, you are clear ...

615
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,600
- You've got the charges, right?
- Oh yeah.

616
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,400
Can't wait to kick some Romulan ass.

617
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,200
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah.

618
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,300
So what kind of combat training do you have?

619
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,500
Fencing.

620
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,400
Pre-jump.

621
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,000
Shuttle commander, you are clear
from USS Enterprise ...

622
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,600
Gentlemen, we're approaching the drop zone.

623
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,600
You have one shot
to land on that platform.

624
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,600
They may have defenses, so pull your chute
as late as possible.

625
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,400
3 ... 2 ... 1.

626
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,600
Remember, the Enterprise won't be able to
beam you back until you've turned off that drill.

627
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,100
Good luck.

628
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,900
Away team is entering the atmosphere, sir.

629
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,900
20 000 m.

630
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,700
Approaching the platform
at 5 800 m.

631
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:37,400
Kirk to Enterprise.
Distance to target 5 000 m.

632
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,300
4 600 m from the platform.

633
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,600
4 100 m to target.

634
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,100
4 000 m.

635
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,700
3 000 m.

636
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,100
2 000 m.
Pull the chute.

637
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:01,000
- 2 000 m.
- Pull your chute, Olson.

638
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,000
No, not yet. Not yet.

639
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,800
- 1 500 m.
- Open the chute!

640
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,000
- Olson, pull your chute!
- 1 000 m.

641
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,600
Olson!

642
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,900
Olson is gone, sir.

643
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,300
Kirk has landed, sir.

644
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,800
Gimme your hand.

645
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,100
Olson had the charges.

646
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,900
I know.

647
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,900
- What do we do?
- This.

648
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:24,500
The jamming signal's gone. Transport
abilities are reestablished.

649
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,700
Transporter control is reengaged sir.

650
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,800
Check all gravitational sensors. I wanna
know what they were doing to the planet.

651
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,300
Aye, Commander. Captain. Sorry, captain.

652
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,300
The drill's been sabotaged sir but
we have reached the planet's core.

653
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,700
Launch red matter.

654
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:01,500
Kirk to Enterprise. They just launched something
at the planet through the hole they just drilled.

655
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,200
- Do you copy Enterprise?
- Yes, sir.

656
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,500
Captain, gravitational sensors
are off the scale.

657
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:12,500
If my calculations are correct,
they're creating a singularity

658
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,400
... that will consume the planet.

659
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:21,500
They're creating a black hole
at the center of Vulcan?

660
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,300
Yes.

661
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,000
How long does the planet have?

662
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,600
Minutes, sir. Minutes.

663
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,300
Alert Vulcan command center to
signal a planet wide evacuation

664
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,600
all channels, all frequencies.
-Wait. - Maintain standard orbit.

665
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,500
Yes, sir.

666
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,500
Where are you going?

667
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:39,700
To evacuate the Vulcan High Council.
Their task is to protect our cultural history,

668
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,900
- My parents will be among them.
- Can't you beam them out?

669
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,900
That is impossible. They will
be in the Katric ark.

670
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,100
I must get them myself.

671
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,900
- Chekov, you have the con.
- Aye.

672
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,600
Kirk to Enterprise.
Beam us out of here.

673
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,100
Stand by, locking on your signal.

674
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,200
- Retract the drill. Let's move out
- Yes, sir.

675
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,800
Fold up.

676
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,100
I can't lock on to them. Don't move.
Don't move!

677
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,400
Sulu.

678
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,400
Sulu.

679
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,800
Hold on.

680
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,800
I've gotcha.
Now pull my chute.

681
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,400
Kirk to Enterprise!
We're falling without a chute!

682
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:39,700
- Beam us up!
- I'm sorry I can't lock on to your signal.

683
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,100
- Beam us up!
- You're moving too fast.

684
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,900
I can do that. I can do that!

685
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,400
- Take the con.
- Aye, sir.

686
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,100
The black hole's expanding. We won't reach
minimum safe distance if we don't leave immediately.

687
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,400
Move. Move... I can do that.
I can do that. Move. Move...

688
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,800
Give me manual control, I can lock on.
Beam us up!

689
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,000
- Enterprise, where are you?
- Hold on. Hold on! Hold on!

690
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:09,400
Now! Now! Now! Do it now!
Now! Now! Now!

691
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:14,900
Hold on. Hold on. Compensating
gravitational pull. Aaand...

692
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,800
Gotcha.

693
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,900
- Thanks.
- No problem.

694
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,700
Clear the pad. I'm beaming to
the surface.

695
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,800
The surface of what?

696
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,100
What, you're going down there?
Are you nuts?

697
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,700
- Spock, you can't do that.
- Energize.

698
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,100
- Spock? - The planet has only
seconds left. We must evacuate.

699
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,100
Mother, now.

700
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:54,370
Spock to Enterprise.
Get us out now.

701
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:57,070
Locking on to you. Don't move.
Stay right where you are.

702
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:08,170
Transport in 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ...

703
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:13,970
- Mother!
- I'm losing her! I'm losing her! ...

704
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:16,970
I've lost her! I've lost her.

705
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:17,270
Acting captain's log, star date 2258.42.

706
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:21,470
We have had no word from captain Pike.

707
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:26,570
I have therefore classified him a hostage
of the war criminal known as Nero

708
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:32,270
Nero, who has destroyed my home planet
and most of its 6 billion inhabitants.

709
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:38,370
While the essence of our culture has been saved
in the elders who now reside upon this ship ...

710
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:44,070
I estimate no more than
10 000 have survived.

711
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:50,870
I am now a member of
an endangered species.

712
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:20,470
I'm sorry.

713
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:26,470
I'm so sorry.

714
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:44,570
What do you need.
Tell me. Tell me.

715
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:55,270
I need everyone ...

716
01:05:56,370 --> 01:06:11,270
- ... to continue performing admirably.
- OK.

717
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:28,370
You must have a lot of questions for me.

718
01:06:29,370 --> 01:06:31,470
I only have one for you.

719
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:37,070
I need the subspace frequencies of
Starfleet's border protection grids.

720
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:40,270
Specifically those surrounding Earth.

721
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:45,170
Christopher, answer my question.

722
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:48,470
No, you answer for the genocide you just
committed against a peaceful planet.

723
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:51,170
No, I prevented genocide.

724
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:58,370
In my time, where I come from,
this is a simple mining vessel.

725
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:02,370
I chose a life of honest labor.

726
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:05,770
to provide for myself and the wife
who was expecting my child.

727
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:08,770
I was off planet doing my job

728
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:10,870
while your Federation did nothing.

729
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:14,270
And allowed my people to burn
while their planet broke in half.

730
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:17,970
And Spock, he didn't help us.
He betrayed us.

731
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:21,670
No, no... you're confused. You're misinformed.
Romulus hasn't been destroyed.

732
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:25,270
It's out there right now. You're blaming the
Federation for something that hasn't happened...

733
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:28,570
It has happened! I watched it happen!
I saw it happen!

734
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:30,270
Don't tell me it didn't happen!

735
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:39,170
And when I lost her.
I promised myself retribution.

736
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:43,570
And for 25 years I planned my
revenge against the Federation.

737
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:47,570
And forgot what it was like to
live a normal life.

738
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:49,670
I did not forget the pain.

739
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:54,970
It's a pain that every surviving
Vulcan now shares.

740
01:07:56,670 --> 01:07:58,670
My purpose, Christopher,

741
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:02,570
is to not simply avoid the destruction
of the home that I love

742
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:09,070
but to create a Romulus that
exists free of the Federation.

743
01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:15,170
You see only then will she be truly saved.

744
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:20,070
That is why I will destroy all the
remaining Federation planets.

745
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:22,370
Starting with yours.

746
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:25,770
Then we have nothing left to discuss.

747
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:32,870
You will give me the frequencies to
disable Earth's defenses.

748
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:40,370
Centaurian slugs. They latch
on to your brain stem...

749
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:44,670
and release a toxin that will
force you to answer.

750
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:48,270
Frequencies please, sir.

751
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:51,270
Christopher Pike, captain of
the USS Enterprise ...

752
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:52,170
As you wish.

753
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:02,070
Have you confirmed that Nero
is heading for Earth?

754
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:04,770
Their trajectory suggests no
other destination, captain.

755
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:06,570
Thank you, lt.

756
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:09,170
Earth may be his next stop, but
we have to assume 

757
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,170
every Federation planet's a target

758
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:12,670
Out of the chair.

759
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:16,870
Well, if the Federation is the target,
why didn't they destroy us?

760
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:19,870
Why would they? Why waste a weapon?
We obviously weren't a threat.

761
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:24,570
That is not it. He said he wanted me to see
something. The destruction of my home planet.

762
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:26,570
How the hell did they do that, by the way?

763
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:28,770
And where did the Romulans get
that kind of weaponry?

764
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:32,470
The engineering comprehension necessary
to artificially create a black hole

765
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:34,170
may suggest an answer.

766
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,570
Such technology could theoretically
be manipulated

767
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:38,470
to create a tunnel through space-time.

768
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:40,670
Damn it man, I am a doctor, not physicist.

769
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:42,970
Are you actually suggesting
they're from the future?

770
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:45,970
If you eliminate the impossible, what ever
remains, however improbable

771
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:47,270
must be the truth.

772
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:48,370
How poetic.

773
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:51,970
Then what would an angry future
Romulan want with captain Pike?

774
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:54,570
As captain he does know details
of Starfleet's defenses.

775
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:56,270
What we need to do is catch
up to that ship,

776
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:58,470
disable it, take it over and get Pike back.

777
01:09:58,470 --> 01:10:02,870
We are technologically outmatched in every
way. A rescue attempt would be illogical.

778
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:05,770
Nero's ship would have to drop
out of warp for us to overtake it.

779
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:09,070
Then what about assigning engineering
crews to try and boost our warp yield?

780
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:11,370
Remaining power and crew are being
used to repair radiation leaks

781
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:13,170
on the lower decks. The damage ...

782
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:15,570
- OK. All right. All right. - ...communications.
Without it... - There's got to be some way.

783
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:20,170
- ...we cannot contact Starfleet. We
must gather with the rest of Starfleet.

784
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:21,870
To balance the terms of the next engagement,
- There won't be a next engagement.

785
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:24,670
By the time we gather it'll be too late.

786
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:27,470
Look, you say he's from the future and
knows what's gonna happen

787
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:29,870
then the logical thing is to be unpredictable.

788
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:32,770
You're assuming that Nero knows
how event's are predicted to unfold.

789
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:35,970
The contrary. Nero's very presence
has altered the flow of history

790
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:38,970
beginning with the attack on the USS Kelvin,
culminating with the events of today,

791
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:44,170
thereby creating an entire new chain of incidents
that cannot be anticipated by either party.

792
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:45,670
An alternate reality.

793
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:48,570
Precisely.

794
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:50,270
Whatever our lives might have been

795
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:52,070
if the time continuum was disrupted

796
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:55,370
our destinies have changed.

797
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:57,970
Mr. Sulu, plot a course for the
Laurentian system. Warp factor 3.

798
01:10:58,070 --> 01:10:59,370
Spock, don't do that.

799
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:03,870
Running back to the rest of the fleet for
a con fab is a massive waste of time...

800
01:11:03,970 --> 01:11:05,670
These orders were issued by
captain Pike when he left.

801
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:07,370
He also ordered us to go back and get him.

802
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:10,770
- Spock, you are captain now. You have...
- I am aware of my responsibilities ...

803
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:13,170
Every second we waste Nero's
getting closer to his next target.

804
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:16,270
That is correct and why I'm instructing
you to accept the fact that I'm...

805
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:20,270
I will not allow us to go backwards...
... instead of hunting Nero down.

806
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:22,670
Security, escort him out.

807
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:33,170
- No.
- Jim!

808
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:40,370
Get him off this ship.

809
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:01,770
Computer, where am I?

810
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:05,170
Location: Delta Vega.
Class M planet. Unsafe.

811
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:09,070
There is a Starfleet outpost 14km
to the northwest.

812
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:12,570
- Remain in your pod ...
- Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

813
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:58,770
Star date 2258.42.

814
01:12:59,570 --> 01:13:02,970
... for ... for ... Whatever.

815
01:13:03,370 --> 01:13:06,870
Acting captain Spock has
marooned me on Delta Vega.

816
01:13:07,070 --> 01:13:11,670
What I believe to be a violation
of security protocol 49.09

817
01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:14,270
governing the treatment of prisoners
aboard a starship.

818
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,370
James T. Kirk.

819
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:30,870
- Excuse me?
- How did you find me?

820
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:35,270
How do you know my name?

821
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:40,270
I have been and always shall be your friend.

822
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:46,470
Look, I don't know you.

823
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:49,170
I am Spock.

824
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:54,770
Bullshit.

825
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:57,370
It is remarkably pleasing to see
you again old friend.

826
01:15:58,170 --> 01:16:00,670
Especially after the events today.

827
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:04,770
Sir, I appreciate what you did for me today

828
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:08,470
but if you were Spock, you'd know
we're not friends at all.

829
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:10,970
You hate me. You marooned
me here for mutiny.

830
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:13,070
- Mutiny?
- Yes.

831
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:15,070
You are not the captain?

832
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:22,070
No, no... You're the captain.

833
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:24,670
Pike was taken hostage.

834
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:27,070
By Nero?

835
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:34,570
What do you know about him?

836
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:37,870
He is a particularly troubled Romulan.

837
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:41,170
Please. Allow me.

838
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:43,270
It will be easier.

839
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:47,170
- Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
- Our minds, one and together.

840
01:16:49,670 --> 01:16:55,570
129 years from now, a star will explode
and threaten to destroy the galaxy.

841
01:16:57,270 --> 01:17:00,070
That is where I'm from Jim.

842
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:01,570
The future.

843
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:07,970
A star went supernova.

844
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:12,170
Consuming everything in its path.

845
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:15,570
I promised the Romulans that I
will save their planet.

846
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:23,370
We outfitted our fastest ship.

847
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:27,070
Using red matter I would create a black hole

848
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:29,870
which would absorb the exploding star.

849
01:17:31,170 --> 01:17:34,170
I was on root when the unthinkable happened.

850
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:39,170
The supernova destroyed Romulus.

851
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:46,370
I had little time.

852
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:52,570
I had to extract the red matter
and shoot it into the supernova.

853
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:11,870
As I began my return trip I was intercepted.

854
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:16,070
- He called himself Nero,
- ... collapse of Romulan Empire.

855
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:19,970
In my attempt to escape, both of
us were pulled into the black hole.

856
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:32,170
Nero went through first.
He was the first to arrive.

857
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:42,670
Nero spent the next 25 years
awaiting my arrival.

858
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:44,870
But what was years for Nero

859
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:48,570
was only seconds for me.

860
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:51,770
I went through the black hole.

861
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:56,870
Nero was waiting for me.

862
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:05,070
He held me responsible for the
loss of his world.

863
01:19:06,970 --> 01:19:09,570
He captured my vessel and spared my life.

864
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:15,670
For one reason. So that
I would know his pain.

865
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:21,770
He beamed me here so that
I can observe his vengeance.

866
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:26,670
As he was helpless to save his planet

867
01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:30,470
I would be helpless to save mine.

868
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:37,070
Billions of lives lost because of me, Jim.

869
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:40,070
Because I failed.

870
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:46,470
Forgive me. Emotional transference
is an effect of the mind meld.

871
01:19:53,670 --> 01:19:56,770
- So you do feel.
- Yes.

872
01:19:56,870 --> 01:19:59,670
Going back in time you changed all our lives.

873
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:03,570
Jim! We must go.

874
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:06,370
There is a Starfleet outpost not far from here.

875
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:09,570
Wait.

876
01:20:10,270 --> 01:20:12,470
Where you came from ...

877
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:16,470
... did I know my father?

878
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:18,970
Yes.

879
01:20:19,370 --> 01:20:22,670
You often spoke of him as being
your inspiration for joining Starfleet.

880
01:20:23,770 --> 01:20:27,170
He proudly lived to see you become
captain of the Enterprise.

881
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:29,070
Captain?

882
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:31,970
A ship we must return you to
as soon as possible.

883
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:43,170
- Warp 3, sir.
- Course 151-3.

884
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:45,470
- Laurentian system, sir.
- Thank you gentlemen.

885
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:49,470
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes. Doctor.

886
01:20:50,770 --> 01:20:52,970
I am aware that James Kirk is a friend of yours.

887
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:55,970
I recognize that supporting me
as you did must have been difficult.

888
01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:57,570
Is that thank you?

889
01:20:57,970 --> 01:21:02,470
- I am simply acknowledging your difficulties.
- Permission to speak freely, sir.

890
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:05,670
- I welcome it.
- Do you?

891
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:09,470
Ok then. Are you out of your Vulcan mind?

892
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:14,370
Are you making a logical choice sending
Kirk away? Probably. But the right one? 

893
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:17,570
Back home we've got a saying. If you're
gonna ride in the Kentucky derby

894
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:19,870
you don't leave your prize stallion in the stable

895
01:21:19,870 --> 01:21:23,570
A curious metaphor, Doctor,
as a stallion must first be broken

896
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:25,470
before it can reach its potential.

897
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:28,370
My God man. You could at least
act like it was a hard decision.

898
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:31,870
I intend to insist in the effort to reestablish
communication with Starfleet.

899
01:21:32,270 --> 01:21:36,070
However, if crew moral is better served
by my roaming the halls weeping

900
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:39,270
I would gladly defer to your medical expertise.

901
01:21:40,670 --> 01:21:42,170
Excuse me.

902
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:48,370
Green blooded little goblin.

903
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:10,570
What?

904
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:16,370
You realize how unacceptable this is?

905
01:23:16,470 --> 01:23:17,770
- Fascinating.
- What?

906
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:20,970
I am sure you're just doing your job, but
could you not come a wee bit sooner?

907
01:23:20,970 --> 01:23:25,670
Six months I've been here. Living off Starfleet
botty nips and a promise of a good meal.

908
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:28,370
And I know exactly what's going on here.

909
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:32,470
Ok? Punishment, isn't it? Ongoing. For
something that was clearly an accident.

910
01:23:32,570 --> 01:23:35,470
- You are Montgomery Scott.
- You know him?

911
01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:37,270
Yeah, it's me. You're in the right place.

912
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:40,570
Unless there’s another hard working
equally starved Starfleet officer around.

913
01:23:40,670 --> 01:23:42,870
- Me.
- Getup, shut up.

914
01:23:43,670 --> 01:23:46,770
You aren't doing anything. You can
eat, like, a bean and you're done.

915
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:49,270
I'm talking about food, real food.

916
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:51,970
But you're here now. So, thank you.
Where is it?

917
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:56,070
You are in fact a Mr. Scott who postulated
the theory of transwarp beaming?

918
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:59,270
That's what I'm talking about.
How'd ya think I wound up here?

919
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:01,370
I had a little debate with my instructor

920
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:05,070
on the issue of relativistic physics and
how it pertains to subspace travel.

921
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:09,170
He seemed to think that the range of
transporting something like a grapefruit

922
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:11,170
was limited to about a 100 miles.

923
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:14,870
I told him that I could not only beam a
grapefruit from one planet to the adjacent planet

924
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:17,570
in the same system, which is easy by the way

925
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:19,470
I could do it with a life form.

926
01:24:20,170 --> 01:24:22,570
So, I tested it on admiral Archer's prize beagle.

927
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:24,170
I know that dog. What happened to it?

928
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:27,970
I'll tell you when it reappears. I don't
know. I do feel guilty about that.

929
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:30,970
What if I told you that your transwarp theory was correct?

930
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:34,270
That it is indeed possible to beam onto
a ship that is travelling at warp speed?

931
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:36,870
I think that if that equation had been
discovered I'd have heard about it.

932
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:38,970
The reason you haven't
heard of it, Mr. Scott,

933
01:24:38,970 --> 01:24:41,270
is because you haven't discovered it yet.

934
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:50,570
- Are you from the future?
- He is. I'm not.

935
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:53,370
Well that's brilliant. Do they still
have sandwiches there?

936
01:24:54,370 --> 01:24:56,470
Well, she's a wee bit dodgy.

937
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:59,270
Shield emitters are totally bum jacked
as well as a few other things.

938
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:00,770
In you go.

939
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:03,770
So, the Enterprise has had it's
maiden voyage, has it?

940
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:05,470
She is one well endowed lady.

941
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:09,570
I'd like to get my hands on her ample nossels,
if you'd pardon the engineering parlance.

942
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:15,770
Except, the thing is, even if I believed you.
Where you're from, what I've done...

943
01:25:15,870 --> 01:25:20,170
Which I don't, by the way. We're still
talking about beaming aboard the Enterprise

944
01:25:20,270 --> 01:25:23,070
while she's travelling faster than light
without a proper receiving pad.

945
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:25,670
Get off there. It's not a climbing frame.

946
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:27,570
The notion of transwarp beaming

947
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:30,870
is like trying to hit a bullet with a smaller bullet

948
01:25:30,970 --> 01:25:33,870
whilst wearing a blindfold, riding a horse.

949
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:34,970
What's that?

950
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:38,170
Your equation for achieving transwarp beaming.

951
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:42,370
You're out of it...

952
01:25:45,770 --> 01:25:49,670
Imagine that. It never occurred to me to
think of space as the thing that was moving

953
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:52,370
You're coming with us, right?

954
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:56,470
No, Jim. That is not my destiny.

955
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:58,870
Your destiny ...

956
01:25:59,570 --> 01:26:02,070
He. The other Spock is not gonna believe me.
Only you can explain what the hell has happened.

957
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:06,170
Under no circumstances can he be made aware
of my existence. You must promise me that.

958
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:10,570
So you're telling me I can't tell you that I'm following
you're own orders. Why not? What happens?

959
01:26:10,770 --> 01:26:13,070
Jim, this is one rule you cannot break.

960
01:26:13,170 --> 01:26:16,770
To stop Nero, you alone must
take command of your ship.

961
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:18,670
How? Over your dead body?

962
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:19,770
Preferably, not.

963
01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:22,670
However, there is Starfleet regulation 619.

964
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:28,770
619 states that any command officer who is 
emotionally compromised by the mission at hand

965
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:31,570
must resign command.

966
01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:37,670
So, you're saying that I have to
emotionally compromise you... guys?

967
01:26:37,770 --> 01:26:40,970
Jim, I just lost my planet.

968
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:45,670
I can tell you, I am emotionally compromised.

969
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:48,770
What you must do is get me to show it.

970
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,570
Aye then lady. Live or die.
Let's get this over with.

971
01:26:58,370 --> 01:27:00,470
You cannot come with me. Go on.

972
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:06,070
Coming back in time, changing history,
that's cheating.

973
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:11,270
A trick I learned from an old friend.

974
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:23,170
Live long and prosper.

975
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:44,570
Mr. Scott?

976
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:51,170
Mr. Scott, can you hear me?

977
01:27:58,870 --> 01:28:01,670
Hold on a second.

978
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:20,070
No. No!

979
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:31,970
RELEASE VALVE.

980
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:42,070
Purifier release valve activated.

981
01:28:48,570 --> 01:28:51,170
You all right? You all right?

982
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:55,770
My head's buzzing and I'm soaked,
but otherwise I'm fine.

983
01:28:55,870 --> 01:29:01,170
Captain Spock, detecting unauthorized
access to water turbine control board

984
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:03,370
Bring up the video.

985
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:10,670
Security, seal the engineering deck.
We have intruders in turbine section 3.

986
01:29:11,870 --> 01:29:13,370
Set phasers to stun.

987
01:29:25,070 --> 01:29:26,570
Halt!

988
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:31,570
Come with me

989
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:34,070
cupcake!

990
01:29:41,470 --> 01:29:42,370
Who are you?

991
01:29:42,570 --> 01:29:43,470
- I am with him.
- He's with me.

992
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:46,670
We are travelling at warp speed. How
did you manage to beam aboard this ship?

993
01:29:46,770 --> 01:29:48,070
You're the genius, you figure it out.

994
01:29:48,070 --> 01:29:51,170
As acting captain of this vessel
I order you to answer the question.

995
01:29:51,170 --> 01:29:53,470
Well I'm not telling, acting captain.

996
01:29:56,370 --> 01:30:00,570
What now? That doesn't frustrate you, does it? My
lack of cooperation, that doesn't make you angry?

997
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:04,070
- Are you a member of Starfleet?
- Yes. Can I get a towel?

998
01:30:04,170 --> 01:30:06,570
Under penalty of court martial I order
you to explain to me how you were able

999
01:30:06,670 --> 01:30:08,870
to beam aboard the ship while moving at warp

1000
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:10,370
- Well.
- Don't answer him.

1001
01:30:10,370 --> 01:30:12,570
You will answer me.

1002
01:30:13,870 --> 01:30:16,670
- I'd rather not take sides.
- What is it with you, Spock?

1003
01:30:19,170 --> 01:30:24,170
Your planet was just destroyed, your
mother murdered, and you're not even upset.

1004
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:26,670
If you are presuming that these
experiences in any way impede 

1005
01:30:26,770 --> 01:30:28,870
my ability to command this ship
you are mistaking.

1006
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:32,470
And yet you were the one who said
fear was necessary for command.

1007
01:30:32,570 --> 01:30:35,770
I mean, did you his ship?
Did you see what he did?

1008
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:38,770
- Yes, of course I did.
- So are you afraid or aren't you?

1009
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:41,370
I will not allow you to lecture me
about the merits of emotion.

1010
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:43,170
- Then why don't you stop me?
- Step away from me Mr. Kirk.

1011
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:47,170
What is it like not to feel anger?
Or heartbreak?

1012
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:50,570
Or the need to stop at nothing to avenge the
death of the woman who gave birth to you.

1013
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:52,570
- Back away from me.
- You feel nothing!

1014
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:55,070
It must not even compute for you.

1015
01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:57,470
You never loved her!

1016
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:23,370
Spock.

1017
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:03,170
Doctor, I am no longer fit for duty.

1018
01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:07,970
I relinquish my command based on the fact
that I have been emotionally compromised.

1019
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:11,270
Please note the time and
date in the ship's log.

1020
01:32:38,370 --> 01:32:40,370
I like this ship.

1021
01:32:40,570 --> 01:32:42,170
You know it's exciting.

1022
01:32:44,670 --> 01:32:48,370
Well congratulations, Jim. Now we've got
no captain and no God damn first officer

1023
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:49,870
to replace him.

1024
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:53,070
Yeah we do.

1025
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:55,470
- What?
- Pike made him first officer.

1026
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:58,670
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Thanks for the support.

1027
01:33:01,870 --> 01:33:05,670
I sure hope you know what you're
doing, captain.

1028
01:33:07,070 --> 01:33:08,970
So do I.

1029
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:15,870
Attention, crew of the Enterprise,
this is James Kirk.

1030
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:20,870
Mr. Spock has resigned commission
and advanced me to acting captain.

1031
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:24,770
I know you're all expecting a regroup with the fleet,

1032
01:33:25,470 --> 01:33:27,670
but I'm ordering a pursuit course
of the enemy ship to Earth.

1033
01:33:27,670 --> 01:33:30,370
I want all departments at battle
stations and ready in 10 minutes.

1034
01:33:31,470 --> 01:33:35,670
Either we're going down or they are.

1035
01:33:36,470 --> 01:33:37,770
Kirk out.

1036
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:47,770
Speak your mind Spock.

1037
01:33:50,370 --> 01:33:52,370
That would be unwise.

1038
01:33:52,370 --> 01:33:56,170
What is necessary is never unwise.

1039
01:33:57,670 --> 01:34:00,770
I am as conflicted as I once was as a child.

1040
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:05,270
You will always be a child of two worlds.

1041
01:34:07,170 --> 01:34:09,870
I am grateful for this.

1042
01:34:10,970 --> 01:34:12,970
And for you.

1043
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:17,670
I feel anger for the one who took mother's life.

1044
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:21,870
An anger I cannot control.

1045
01:34:25,470 --> 01:34:30,770
I believe, as she would say ...

1046
01:34:31,770 --> 01:34:34,570
... do not try to.

1047
01:34:34,970 --> 01:34:39,470
You asked me once why I married your mother.

1048
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:46,570
I married her because I loved her.

1049
01:34:54,370 --> 01:34:56,770
Whatever the case we need to
get aboard Nero's ship undetected.

1050
01:34:56,770 --> 01:34:59,270
Just can't just go in there guns blazing, Jim.

1051
01:34:59,370 --> 01:35:01,170
I'm telling you to ...

1052
01:35:01,170 --> 01:35:03,970
- Captain Kirk. Captain Kirk.
- Yes, Chekov. What is it?

1053
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:05,870
Based on the Nerada’s course
from Vulcan

1054
01:35:05,970 --> 01:35:09,270
I have projected that Nero will
travel pass Saturn.

1055
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:12,770
Like you said we need to stay
invisible to Nero or he'll destroy us.

1056
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:15,370
If Mr. Scott can get us to warp factor 4

1057
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:19,770
and if we drop out of warp behind one
of Saturn's moons, say Titan.

1058
01:35:19,870 --> 01:35:22,470
The magnetic distortion from
the planet's rings

1059
01:35:22,570 --> 01:35:24,970
will make us invisible to Nero's sensors.

1060
01:35:24,970 --> 01:35:27,370
From there, as long as the drill
is not activated

1061
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:29,070
we can beam aboard the enemy ship.

1062
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:30,870
Aye, that might work.

1063
01:35:31,470 --> 01:35:33,870
- Wait a minute kid, how old are you?
- 17, sir.

1064
01:35:34,570 --> 01:35:35,870
Oh good, he's 17.

1065
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:37,570
Doctor.

1066
01:35:37,570 --> 01:35:41,070
Mr. Chekov is correct. I can
confirm his telemetry.

1067
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:43,570
If Mr. Sulu is able to maneuver us into position

1068
01:35:43,570 --> 01:35:46,270
I can beam aboard Nero's ship,
steal back the black hole device 

1069
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:48,770
and if possible bring back captain Pike.

1070
01:35:49,170 --> 01:35:51,070
I won't allow you to do that Mr. Spock.

1071
01:35:51,870 --> 01:35:54,570
Romulans and Vulcans
share a common ancestry.

1072
01:35:55,070 --> 01:35:58,670
Our cultural similarities will make it easier
for me to access the ship's computer

1073
01:35:58,770 --> 01:36:00,070
and locate the device.

1074
01:36:01,670 --> 01:36:05,670
Also my mother was human. Which
makes Earth the only home I have left.

1075
01:36:13,070 --> 01:36:14,970
I'm coming with you.

1076
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:18,470
I would cite regulation, but
I know you will simply ignore it.

1077
01:36:21,170 --> 01:36:24,270
See? We are getting to know each other.

1078
01:36:39,570 --> 01:36:41,670
Prepare the drill.

1079
01:36:57,170 --> 01:37:02,970
All stop in 3 ... 2 ... 1.

1080
01:37:08,070 --> 01:37:10,970
Gimme 1/4 impulse burst for 5 seconds.

1081
01:37:11,070 --> 01:37:12,970
I'll do the rest with thrusters.
On my mark.

1082
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:13,970
Aye.

1083
01:37:14,670 --> 01:37:15,670
Fire.

1084
01:37:42,470 --> 01:37:44,970
Transporter room. We are in
position above Titan.

1085
01:37:45,370 --> 01:37:48,070
Really? Fine job Mr. Sulu, well done.

1086
01:37:48,670 --> 01:37:51,870
- How are we Scotty?
- Unbelievably sir. The ship is in position.

1087
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:59,770
Whatever happens Mr. Sulu, if you
think you have the tactical advantage 

1088
01:37:59,870 --> 01:38:02,970
you fire on that ship even if we're still
on board. That's an order.

1089
01:38:05,470 --> 01:38:06,470
Yes, sir.

1090
01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:09,270
Otherwise we'll contact the Enterprise
when we're ready to be beamed back.

1091
01:38:10,370 --> 01:38:12,470
Good luck.

1092
01:38:24,570 --> 01:38:27,470
- I will be back.
- You better be.

1093
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:32,770
- I'll be monitoring your frequency.
- Thank you, Nyota.

1094
01:38:49,170 --> 01:38:51,870
- So her first name's Nyota?
- I have no comment on the matter.

1095
01:38:51,970 --> 01:38:55,270
Oky doky then. If there’s any common
sense in the design of the enemy's ship 

1096
01:38:55,270 --> 01:38:58,270
I should be putting you somewhere in the
cargo bay, shouldn't be a soul in site.

1097
01:38:58,670 --> 01:38:59,770
Energize.

1098
01:39:43,170 --> 01:39:45,770
Captain, we have Starfleet officers
aboard the ship.

1099
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:48,470
- One of them is Vulcan.
- No.

1100
01:39:52,970 --> 01:39:54,770
Ayel!

1101
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:11,070
- I'll cover ya.
- Are you certain?

1102
01:40:11,070 --> 01:40:12,570
Yeah, I've gotcha.

1103
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:35,670
Do you know where it is?
The black hole device?

1104
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:39,570
And captain Pike.

1105
01:41:01,670 --> 01:41:02,770
Move.

1106
01:41:03,670 --> 01:41:05,670
They have activated the drill.

1107
01:41:06,670 --> 01:41:08,270
Communication and transportation are inoperative.

1108
01:41:08,370 --> 01:41:09,870
Sulu, please tell me you have them.

1109
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:11,570
Otherwise we won't be
able to beam them back.

1110
01:41:11,570 --> 01:41:13,470
Kirk and Spock are on their own now.

1111
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:36,270
I foresee a complication. The design of this ship
is far more advanced than I have anticipated.

1112
01:41:36,670 --> 01:41:39,470
Voice print and face recognition
analysis enabled.

1113
01:41:39,770 --> 01:41:41,870
Welcome back ambassador Spock.

1114
01:41:41,970 --> 01:41:43,370
That's weird.

1115
01:41:44,770 --> 01:41:47,570
Computer, what is your manufacturing origin?

1116
01:41:47,770 --> 01:41:52,270
Star date 2387. Commissioned by the
Vulcan Science Academy.

1117
01:41:55,270 --> 01:41:57,470
It appears that you have been keeping
important information from me.

1118
01:41:57,570 --> 01:41:59,670
You'll be able to fly this thing, right?

1119
01:41:59,670 --> 01:42:01,470
Something tells me I already have.

1120
01:42:02,770 --> 01:42:04,570
- Good luck.
- Jim.

1121
01:42:05,670 --> 01:42:09,170
The statistical likelihood that our
plan will succeed is less than 4,3%.

1122
01:42:09,270 --> 01:42:09,870
I will work.

1123
01:42:09,870 --> 01:42:12,070
In the event that I don't return
please tell lt. Uhura ...

1124
01:42:12,170 --> 01:42:14,070
Spock, it'll work.

1125
01:42:24,770 --> 01:42:26,170
Fascinating.

1126
01:42:34,670 --> 01:42:37,370
Startup sequence initiated.

1127
01:43:21,170 --> 01:43:23,770
Nero, order your men to disable
the drill or I will ...

1128
01:43:33,870 --> 01:43:36,870
I know your face from Earth's history.

1129
01:44:21,970 --> 01:44:24,470
James T. Kirk was considered
to be a great man.

1130
01:44:25,370 --> 01:44:29,270
He went on to captain the USS
Enterprise. But that was another life.

1131
01:44:30,170 --> 01:44:32,870
A life I will deprive you of just like
I did your father.

1132
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:09,670
Captain Nero. The Vulcan ship's been
taken. The drill has been destroyed.

1133
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:14,770
Spock! Spock!

1134
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:34,370
- Open a channel.
- Yes, sir.

1135
01:45:35,670 --> 01:45:38,870
Spock, I knew I should have
killed you when I had the chance.

1136
01:45:38,970 --> 01:45:41,170
I hereby confiscate this illegally
obtained ship

1137
01:45:41,170 --> 01:45:42,970
and order you to surrender your
vessel. No terms.

1138
01:45:43,070 --> 01:45:44,570
That ship ... take it out.

1139
01:45:44,570 --> 01:45:47,670
- Sir, if you ignite the red matter..
- I want the Spock dead now!

1140
01:46:03,370 --> 01:46:05,170
- He went to warp.
- Go after him.

1141
01:46:05,170 --> 01:46:06,170
Yes, sir.

1142
01:46:36,570 --> 01:46:39,070
Your species is even weaker
than I expected.

1143
01:46:43,070 --> 01:46:44,970
You can't even speak.

1144
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:48,370
What?

1145
01:46:48,870 --> 01:46:51,170
I got your gun.

1146
01:47:17,170 --> 01:47:18,470
What's he doing?

1147
01:47:18,570 --> 01:47:21,570
Ambassador Spock, you are
on a collision course.

1148
01:47:21,970 --> 01:47:23,670
Fire everything.

1149
01:47:30,370 --> 01:47:34,470
Incoming missiles. If the ship is hit,
the red matter will be ignited.

1150
01:47:34,670 --> 01:47:36,470
Understood.

1151
01:47:42,470 --> 01:47:43,970
Captain, I've picked up another ship.

1152
01:48:05,570 --> 01:48:08,070
- What are you doing here?
- Following orders.

1153
01:48:28,770 --> 01:48:30,670
Enterprise now!

1154
01:48:53,270 --> 01:48:54,970
Nice timing Scotty.

1155
01:48:55,870 --> 01:48:58,070
I've never beamed three people
from two targets

1156
01:48:58,170 --> 01:48:59,670
onto one pad before.

1157
01:48:59,970 --> 01:49:02,470
- Jim. - Bones.
-I've got him.

1158
01:49:05,670 --> 01:49:07,570
That was pretty good.

1159
01:49:08,170 --> 01:49:11,270
Captain, the enemy ship is loosing
power. They're shields are down.

1160
01:49:11,470 --> 01:49:13,370
- Hail them now.
- Aye.

1161
01:49:48,770 --> 01:49:51,470
This is captain James T. Kirk
of the USS Enterprise.

1162
01:49:52,070 --> 01:49:54,670
Your ship is compromised. You're
too close to the singularity

1163
01:49:54,770 --> 01:49:57,770
to survive without assistance
which we are willing to provide.

1164
01:50:00,970 --> 01:50:02,770
Captain, what are you doing?

1165
01:50:02,870 --> 01:50:05,370
Showing them compassion may be the only way
to make peace with Romulus, Spock.

1166
01:50:05,370 --> 01:50:08,370
It's logical, Spock.
Thought you'd like that.

1167
01:50:08,870 --> 01:50:11,470
No, not really. Not this time.

1168
01:50:11,570 --> 01:50:15,770
I would rather suffer the end of
Romulus a thousand times,

1169
01:50:15,870 --> 01:50:20,270
I would rather die in agony than
accept assistance from you.

1170
01:50:20,370 --> 01:50:21,570
You've got it.

1171
01:50:22,270 --> 01:50:24,570
Arm phasers. Fire everything we've got.

1172
01:50:24,570 --> 01:50:25,570
Yes, sir.

1173
01:51:10,470 --> 01:51:12,570
- Sulu, let's go home.
- Yes, sir.

1174
01:51:23,770 --> 01:51:26,070
- Why aren't we at warp?
- We are, sir.

1175
01:51:26,270 --> 01:51:28,470
Kirk to engineering.
Get us out of here, Scotty.

1176
01:51:28,470 --> 01:51:30,470
You bet your ass captain.

1177
01:51:33,570 --> 01:51:35,670
Captain, we're caught in
the gravity well. It's got us.

1178
01:51:35,670 --> 01:51:37,270
Go to maximum warp. Push it!

1179
01:51:37,270 --> 01:51:39,270
I'm giving it all she's got captain.

1180
01:51:48,570 --> 01:51:51,070
All she's got isn't good enough.
What else you got?

1181
01:51:51,070 --> 01:51:53,370
Ok, if we eject the core and detonate

1182
01:51:53,470 --> 01:51:56,270
the blast could be enough to push us away.
I can't promise anything though.

1183
01:51:59,570 --> 01:52:01,470
Do it! Do it! Do it!

1184
01:52:02,170 --> 01:52:03,970
- Clear the area. Go!
- Yes, sir.

1185
01:53:31,570 --> 01:53:32,970
Father?

1186
01:53:41,570 --> 01:53:44,170
I am not our father.

1187
01:53:51,070 --> 01:53:55,670
There are so few Vulcans left we
cannot afford to ignore each other.

1188
01:53:58,770 --> 01:54:01,670
Then why did you send Kirk aboard when
you alone could have explained the truth?

1189
01:54:01,770 --> 01:54:03,770
Because you needed each other.

1190
01:54:03,770 --> 01:54:08,070
I could not deprive you of the revelation
of all that you can accomplish together.

1191
01:54:08,170 --> 01:54:11,370
Of a friendship that will define you both.

1192
01:54:11,570 --> 01:54:13,770
In ways you cannot yet realize.

1193
01:54:15,170 --> 01:54:17,670
How'd you persuade him to
keep your secret?

1194
01:54:17,770 --> 01:54:20,970
He inferred that universe
ending paradoxes would ensue

1195
01:54:21,070 --> 01:54:22,670
should he break his promise.

1196
01:54:22,670 --> 01:54:24,370
You lied?

1197
01:54:25,370 --> 01:54:28,470
- Oh. I implied.
- A gamble?

1198
01:54:28,570 --> 01:54:30,370
An act of faith.

1199
01:54:30,370 --> 01:54:33,870
One I hope you will repeat in
the future in Starfleet.

1200
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:37,370
In the face of extinction it is only
logical I resign my Starfleet commission

1201
01:54:37,470 --> 01:54:38,570
and help rebuild our race.

1202
01:54:38,570 --> 01:54:41,170
And yet you can be in two places at once.

1203
01:54:42,170 --> 01:54:44,370
I urge you to remain in Starfleet.

1204
01:54:45,270 --> 01:54:48,970
I've already located a suitable planet
on which to establish a Vulcan colony.

1205
01:54:49,570 --> 01:54:53,470
Spock, in this case do yourself a favor

1206
01:54:54,870 --> 01:54:58,270
put aside logic, do what feels right.

1207
01:55:04,370 --> 01:55:07,570
Since my customary farewell
would appear awfully self serving

1208
01:55:07,870 --> 01:55:10,870
I shall simply say good luck.

1209
01:55:22,570 --> 01:55:25,970
This assembly calls captain
James Tiberius Kirk.

1210
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:30,070
Your inspirational valor and supreme
dedication to your comrades

1211
01:55:30,170 --> 01:55:32,470
is in keeping with the highest
traditions of service.

1212
01:55:33,270 --> 01:55:37,770
And reflect at most credit to yourself,
your crew and the Federation.

1213
01:55:38,970 --> 01:55:42,070
It is my honor to award you
with this commendation.

1214
01:55:46,370 --> 01:55:51,070
By Starfleet order 28455, you are 
hereby directed to report to admiral Pike

1215
01:55:51,370 --> 01:55:54,970
USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief.

1216
01:56:03,270 --> 01:56:04,770
I relieve you, sir.

1217
01:56:05,570 --> 01:56:07,570
I am relieved.
