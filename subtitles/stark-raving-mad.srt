00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:34,544
When you get that break,
you take it, right?

3
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,755
Right.

4
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:41,588
But when you get that break
and you reach the top...

5
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,594
savor it.

6
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,324
Take it all in
and let them suck your dick...

7
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:50,892
while you tell them how wrong they were
for not believing you in the first place.

8
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,097
Then get out.

9
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,401
Quit. Exit.

10
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,035
- And make sure to leave them wondering.

11
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,949
I was watching the Learning Channel
the other day.

12
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,245
There was a special on Buffalo Bill.

13
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,547
You know, the great
Wild West showman?

14
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,522
For years, this guy was the shit.

15
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:15,424
I mean, he helped tame the Wild West,
and he made a lot of money doing it.

16
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,190
But he didn't get out
in time, you know?

17
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,699
He tried to hold on.
You just can't do that.

18
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,998
You see, at the age of 70,
Bill was still doing Wild West shows...

19
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,004
but for other guys' circuses...

20
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,006
'cause he was dead broke.

21
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:31,008
Big mistake.

22
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,079
They used to have to prop
the old bastard on his horse...

23
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,705
he'd do a lap
around the center ring...

24
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:40,616
then they'd help him off his horse
and put him to bed for the night.

25
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,349
Real fucking impressive, Bill.

26
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,226
Well, not me. This is it.

27
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,763
After tonight I'm done.

28
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:55,300
No one's propping me
on a pony when I'm 70.

29
00:03:55,401 --> 00:04:00,134
Keep the boom-boom jungle music down
to a reasonable level, all right?

30
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,401
<i>Define "reasonable level."</i>
<i>It's a fucking night club.</i>

31
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:05,773
I don't have to define it.
I'm gonna be here to enforce it.

32
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,780
You're gonna be here? L-- I thought
you were taking off for the night.

33
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,782
I changed my mind, okay?

34
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:15,081
I'm regretting letting you guys
talk me into this after-hours crap.

35
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,453
This is my club,
so I'm gonna be here, all right?

36
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,186
-<i>Sure. Whatever.</i>
- Yeah, that's cool.

37
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,092
Good.

38
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:27,633
<i>Get a fuckin' thesaurus if you</i>
<i>need it better explained to you.</i>

39
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,996
- This ain't cool, man.

40
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,041
We can't have him here. He's gonna
wreck the whole fuckin' plan, Ben.

41
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:39,043
<i>We rented this space...</i>

42
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:43,172
that shitty... ass neck.

43
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,913
- Don't worry about it, Rikki.
- We're in way over our heads.
You know that, Ben?

44
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:52,185
This is too big. It's too complicated.
It's not gonna end good.

45
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,988
I said don't worry, okay?

46
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:58,359
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you. You trust me, right?

47
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,862
We're fucked. All right?

48
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,065
<i>This is the most nuts thing</i>
<i>you ever thought of. It's too risky.</i>

49
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,642
I don't care
what Gregory wants, okay?

50
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:14,304
Now-Now we can't play the music loud?
Let's go back to grifting.

51
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:19,010
Rikki, how do you think Gregory
would react if we told him...

52
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,849
"You know what? We're not
gonna steal the statue for you." Huh?

53
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:27,722
We'd end up like Cheng One-Eye,
that's all. I'll take care of Partridge.

54
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,935
Hey, Partridge.
I need a big black marker. You got one?

55
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,477
I saw the way you and that
little shit looked at each other
when I said I was gonna be here.

56
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,069
You two are planning on breaking
all sorts of laws tonight, aren't you?

57
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,275
I see anything that could
get me shut down--

58
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,443
<i>underage drinking,</i>
<i>noise, drugs--</i>

59
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,078
- I am pulling the plug on your asses!
- Good.

60
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,680
Black marker. May I?

61
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:03,626
When I say, "Turn the music down,"
you say, "How much, Mr. Partridge?"

62
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,789
- <i>You got it?</i>
- Relax. Okay?

63
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:09,163
- Good God. The DJ we hired is really mellow.

64
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:13,398
- A real peace-love kind of...
- Are you done fucking with me?

65
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,906
Guy.

66
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:19,535
You motherfucker!
Fuck off!

67
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,113
I'll be right back.

68
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,809
- Why did you shove him?
- I didn't.

69
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,715
- <i>I was just asking him</i>
<i>not to touch my records.</i>
- I was trying to help him--

70
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,380
Yeah, and that involved
touching them, didn't it?

71
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:36,253
All right. Now that we're even,
who the hell are you?

72
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:39,331
Is that like some kind
of trick question?

73
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,992
- Where's DJ Max?
- He couldn't make it.

74
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:46,731
People are coming to hear DJ Max.
His name's all over the flyers.

75
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,000
All right.
What's your name?

76
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:53,568
- Steve Moulding.
- No, I mean your DJ name.

77
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:58,343
Oh. Oh, my DJ name.
That would be Steven Moulding.

78
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,851
Look, asshole...

79
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:04,912
you need a DJ name
like... DJ Max has.

80
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:08,687
Who the fuck wants to hear Steven Moulding?
I don't. Do you, Rikki?

81
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,593
Mm-mmm.

82
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,756
Fuck you.

83
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:19,131
All right.
DJ Fuck You it is. Rikki?

84
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:26,936
- Bye-bye, Rikki.
- Bye-bye, DJ Fuck You.

85
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,843
I want you to play the red record
at 1:45 a.m. Tonight.

86
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:41,222
Then play the blue one at 1:55.

87
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:47,827
Fuck it up,
and I'll shoot your family.

88
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,300
Have a good set.

89
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:59,308
- Did you just grab his balls, Ben?
- Why? Are you jealous?

90
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,380
Yes.

91
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:18,226
"X" marks the spot.

92
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,698
Okay. One more review,
then it's show time.

93
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,701
- Betty.
- Okay.

94
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,431
The bank alarm system
is divided into three parts.

95
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,837
Two of them I can override
in my sleep.

96
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:32,035
Only the third one concerns us.
It's a sonic detector.

97
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:35,204
Once 6.0 is reached
on this vibration actuator...

98
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,613
the vibrations cause that
third alarm to shut itself down.

99
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,551
For every precaution, there's
an equal and opposite weakness.

100
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,626
Case in point:
There's a bank behind this wall.

101
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,957
Three separate levels of alarms.

102
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,860
Unbreachable, right? Wrong.

103
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:56,230
Betty used to work for a software company
designing security systems...

104
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,395
for some asshole who couldn't
keep his hands off of her software.

105
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,405
She got her revenge, though.

106
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:04,476
She discovered a bug in this
particular bank's security system...

107
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,239
and tonight she's exploiting it
to make us all rich.

108
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,246
She may not be a seasoned crook...

109
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:12,806
but where she lacks experience,
she makes up for in heart and moxie.

110
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,786
That counts for a lot in my book.

111
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,221
As long as we keep that party upstairs
loud as hell, we're fine.

112
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:23,989
Keep the music and the crowd hoppin',
and the alarm is totally neutralized.

113
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:28,760
At 11:00, once the vibrations from
the club neutralize that third alarm...

114
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,769
I start drilling into the alarm nest
in the circuit panel...

115
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:35,967
so that Betty can reach the first two
alarm systems and take them off-line.

116
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:41,173
Jake Nealson was big on
the metal scene in the late '80s.

117
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,748
Pyro guy.
Worked in all the huge tours.

118
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,977
Then grunge came along,
and Jake found himself tending bar.

119
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,954
But tonight, Jake makes
his glorious return to pyrotechnics.

120
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,355
He's gonna put a new door
in the wall, and, uh...

121
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,984
hopefully not kill us all
in the process.

122
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,893
Okay, so maybe he's not
a real demolitions man...

123
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:03,162
but he doesn't owe allegiance
to Mr. Gregory like every other
real bomb guy on this coast.

124
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,228
And I gotta tell you, underneath
that crunchy chocolate shell...

125
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,275
Jake's a big, warm nougat of a guy.

126
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,339
Then once Betty's got those two down...

127
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,816
I blow the wall to the bank,
and in goes Jeffrey.

128
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,648
2:00 a.m., after Jake opens
a new door in the wall...

129
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,723
I hang a clothesline,
go in over the sensors.

130
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,958
Jeffrey's our box man.

131
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,518
His family's owned the Pinkerton
Safe Company for four generations.

132
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,759
Jeffrey grew up assuming he was
next in line to take over the business...

133
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,836
but his father felt that Jeffrey
was a superstitious little fuckup...

134
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,838
so the old man left the company
to Jeffrey's younger sister.

135
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,067
Jeffrey swore he'd get his revenge...

136
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:46,076
by breaking in to every safe
his family ever designed...

137
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:49,636
more or less proving his father right,
come to think of it.

138
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,843
Anyway, he's gonna get
a little closer to his goal tonight.

139
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,852
I hope.

140
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:58,549
At 3:50 a.m., I'm on my way out of
the vault with the goods in my bag.

141
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:03,595
4:30 a.m., I get the bag to Gregory,
and we are rich.

142
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,494
By the time the rave ends
in the morning and alarms go off...

143
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,499
we'll be long gone.

144
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,395
- <i>Here.</i>
- Okay, Rikki.

145
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,473
Like we talked about.

146
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:17,906
You get the rave loud, man.
We keep it loud.

147
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,672
This has got to read above 6.0.

148
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,544
If it drops below that,
the alarm reactivates, goes off...

149
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,549
and we're fucked.

150
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,619
Six-oh, man.

151
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:32,186
You can do this tonight.
I know you can.

152
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,260
And this is it.
We retire.

153
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,063
Hey, Dirk.

154
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,107
Hey. Hey, girls.

155
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,700
So I guess I'll see you guys--
Oh, thank you.

156
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,303
Nice pants, asshole.

157
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:58,941
- He thought you were serious!

158
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,691
Hey, Ben?
Who's Cheng One-Eye?

159
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,218
One of Gregory's guys
a few years ago.

160
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,389
Know how he got that name?

161
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,399
He lost an eye?

162
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,469
Come on, man.
What the fuck!

163
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,438
You don't get the name Cheng One-Eye
'cause he lost a fucking ear. Right?

164
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,907
- Right.
- I'm sayin', do you know
how he lost that eye?

165
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,208
- No.
- He tried to double-cross
Gregory, that's how.

166
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,442
Remember Tommy Fingernails?

167
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,450
Yeah, sure.

168
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,452
Same thing.

169
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:39,012
Cheng used to have both eyes,
Tommy used to have fingernails.

170
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,094
You fuck with Gregory,
you get a nickname.

171
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,253
I don't want a nickname, Rikki.

172
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,263
Do you want a nickname?

173
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,663
- I don't want a nickname, either.
- All right. Good.

174
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,999
When we get in there, don't say shit
unless he talks to you, okay?

175
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,072
Okay.

176
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,342
- You ready for this?
- I'm ready.

177
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,920
- Mr. Gregory.
- <i>Hello, Benjamin.</i>

178
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:19,691
<i>I see you brought a friend.</i>
<i>That's nice.</i>

179
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,926
<i>Please, sit.</i>

180
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,080
So...

181
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,540
this is Rikki?

182
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,516
<i>Nice pants.</i>

183
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:53,889
Ever had
your fortune told, Rikki?

184
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,560
Uh... no.

185
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,570
Not-- Not really.

186
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,208
Give me your hand.

187
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,256
Sorry. Bad fortune.

188
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,688
Aah! Ow!

189
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,459
- <i>Ben.!</i>
- Get off me!

190
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,693
All right!

191
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,566
<i>I'll be outside.</i>

192
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,605
I asked you to meet me here alone.
I was specific on that request.

193
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,544
<i>Consider that a friendly warning.</i>

194
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,208
Rikki reminds me of your brother.

195
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,948
<i>I still feel badly about</i>
<i>what happened to Kevin.</i>

196
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,490
<i>He had potential.</i>

197
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:56,220
It pains me to force you
to pay off his debts like this, but...

198
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:59,229
I am a businessman, after all.

199
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,492
<i>Examples must be made.</i>

200
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,396
- This will go smoothly.
- As long as you're sure the statue's there.

201
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,167
The safety deposit vault
next to it is one of my own.

202
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,244
I watched them move
the statue in. It's there.

203
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,375
After this...

204
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,613
I'm no one's errand boy anymore.

205
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,621
I'm cleaning the slate tonight.

206
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:31,452
You've talked a good game, Benjamin,
but now it's time to deliver, isn't it?

207
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,329
It's all under control.
Why don't you go back to your place?

208
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,734
Wait for you at home?
Oh, I don't think so.

209
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,671
- This place is 24 hours, right?
- Yeah, but it puts you--

210
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:47,212
Then shut the fuck up.
If I want to be here, I'll be here.

211
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,915
It is now 10:00.

212
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:55,111
I'll be here until 5:00 a.m.

213
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,520
<i>I expect you to be sitting in this booth,</i>
<i>handing me the statue at that time.</i>

214
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,493
You okay?

215
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,495
<i>Uh, yeah, I'll be all right.</i>

216
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,565
Let me look.

217
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:13,030
I'm sorry, man. I didn't know
he was gonna pull any shit.

218
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,198
Let's get it cleaned up
when we get back. Let's go.

219
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,242
There's another thing, Rikki.

220
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,471
Gregory's gonna stay here all night.

221
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:24,879
- He thinks we're gonna try
and dash with the statue.
- Oh, shit.

222
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:29,353
- Oh. But we're not, right?
- Of course not.

223
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,253
This has got to go silky-fucking-smooth
tonight, Rikki.

224
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,608
- <i>I don't think so.</i>

225
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,576
Let me in the fucking club,
you piece of shit!

226
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,578
- What's wrong?
- Fake I.D.

227
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,671
- No, it's not.
- Sorry. You can't come in.

228
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:34,583
That's my real I.D.
Bite me.

229
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,883
This doesn't look like
just a dye job to me.

230
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,653
See, you're a brunette,
and this I.D.'s for a natural blonde.

231
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,887
Oh, yeah? Does this look
brunette to you?

232
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,556
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

233
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,866
<i>Huh?</i>

234
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,462
Don't be a dick, Dirk.
Let her in.

235
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,029
Oh, God.

236
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,191
- What's wrong, Vanessa?
- Ben McGewan.

237
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:26,931
- Asshole.
- Is he gonna follow me
around all night <i>again?</i>

238
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,530
When do you think
he's gonna get the hint?

239
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:33,600
I don't know. The brick through
his windshield wasn't enough of a hint?

240
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,173
Cool.

241
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,480
Looks like he's over you.

242
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,555
Asshole.

243
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,498
Hey, Ben. Did you order
some transvestites?

244
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,975
Uh, 'cause they're here.

245
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,742
Oh! The S&M show.

246
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,340
It's midnight already?

247
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:16,285
Got a place for us girls
to put our faces on?

248
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:19,118
Yeah. Glad you're here.

249
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:23,183
- Rikki, take 'em backstage.
- Okay.

250
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,422
So, just curious--

251
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,989
<i>How do you hide</i>
<i>your dick and your balls?</i>

252
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,121
What the fuck is that?

253
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,127
What?

254
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,756
What do you mean "what"?
I'm not listening to that shit
while I work. Turn it off.

255
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,267
I can't. I have to have it on to work.
It soothes me.

256
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,930
Well, blow jobs soothe me, but you're
not giving me one while I'm working.

257
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,237
Not funny. That's not funny.
You know that, right?

258
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,141
- I gotta play this or I can't work.
- You're a little bitch.

259
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,443
- <i>Do you know that?</i>
- You're a big fucking Mongoloid.

260
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,279
Both of you, shut the f--

261
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,047
Shut the fuck up.

262
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,090
<i>Just leave the music on</i>
<i>if it helps him, Jake. Damn.</i>

263
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,828
- Now what?
- Fortune Fish.

264
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,668
Fortune Fish.
What the fuck is a Fortune Fish?

265
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:46,733
Fortune Fish. Never lies.

266
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,313
- <i>I use it before every job.</i>
- Oh. Good.

267
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,042
For a second there
I thought you were insane.

268
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,051
- It's good to know
you're just a fuckhead.
- Seriously.

269
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,621
Three years ago,
I was with these guys...

270
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:01,022
gonna break into the World Bank
of Commerce down on Fourth.

271
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:05,722
Before we started, I consulted
the Fortune Fish, and--

272
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,459
<i>And?</i>

273
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,661
- And what?

274
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,761
It flipped.

275
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:17,035
- What does that mean?
- Doom.

276
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:20,339
<i>Certain failure.</i>
<i>I refused to go.</i>

277
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,710
They went on without me,
and guess what.

278
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,249
They're all doing 10 to 20 in Chino...

279
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,979
because they, like yourselves...

280
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,056
scoffed at the power
of the Fortune Fish.

281
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,887
Uh-huh.

282
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:43,299
<i>Shit. Oh, shit.!</i>

283
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:47,998
Man, it curled! Danger!
Proceed with extreme caution!

284
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,006
Shit!

285
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:14,398
How are the, uh... girls?

286
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,297
Fine. They're gettin' dressed.

287
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,836
They said they have a snake guy comin'.

288
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,506
Why do the transvestites
have a snake guy comin'?

289
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,343
It's part of the show.

290
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,848
There's a lot I don't know
about transvestites, isn't there?

291
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,552
Oh, my God!

292
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,418
Ben! Ben, this place is stocked
with beautiful women...

293
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,552
and you're reading
<i>National Geographic.</i>

294
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,689
You wanna see what we're stealing,
or are you just gonna talk shit all night?

295
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,737
What does Gregory want with
it anyway? Is he gonna sell it?

296
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,636
It's not the money
in this one for Gregory.

297
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:59,541
Listen up.
A little story for you.

298
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,613
Now, there's four statues
total, okay?

299
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,909
Ping-I, god of rivers.

300
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,916
Fei Lien, god of wind.

301
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:10,818
Yen-Lo-Wang, god of earth
and Chu Jung, god of fire.

302
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,390
The four elements.

303
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,461
Are you listening to me? You're doing this.
I don't know what that is.

304
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,085
- Yeah, I'm listening.
- You sure?

305
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:21,893
- Yeah, yeah.
- The last man to own all four statues...

306
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,767
was Emperor Han Wu-Ti of the Han Dynasty
over 2,000 years ago.

307
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,340
Legend has it that when
he controlled the four statues...

308
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,341
he was master
of the four elements.

309
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,810
- Like He-Man.
- No, He-Man was master of the universe.

310
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,610
<i>Anyway, Gregory's collected</i>
<i>the other three.</i>

311
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,617
<i>When we get Chu Jung here...</i>

312
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,620
<i>he'll be the first man</i>
<i>to own them all since 87 B.C.</i>

313
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:47,658
I didn't know Gregory went in for
all that supernatural, superstitious stuff.

314
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,659
He doesn't...

315
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,662
but the Chinese mafia he deals
with every day sure as hell does.

316
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,823
<i>Gregory knows that.</i>

317
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,299
He knows if he has all four statues,
it fucks with their heads--

318
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:59,370
<i>Vanessa's here.</i>
<i>You know that?</i>

319
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:02,440
I'm telling you a story here,
you're talking about Vanessa.

320
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:06,602
- Yeah, I noticed.
- So you're gonna go for it... again?

321
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:09,373
No, Rikki.

322
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,109
<i>Do you mind if I go for it?</i>

323
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:33,193
Whoo.

324
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,797
Where you going?

325
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,814
Hey.

326
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,821
<i>We hit 6.0 about 45 minutes ago.</i>

327
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,751
What the hell is this?

328
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:59,592
<i>Drugs? There's no drug use</i>
<i>in bank robbery, Betty.</i>

329
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,428
Don't blame me.
The shit belongs to stoner boy.

330
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:05,935
Excuse me? Betty? Bite me.
I work better stoned.

331
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,699
Besides, we had to
calm down Jeffrey.

332
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,571
- Why did Jeffrey need calming down, Jake?
- The Fortune Fish.

333
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,203
- Danger. Proceed with extreme caution.

334
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:27,421
Hey! You gotta talk to Partridge, man.

335
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,962
- He's gonna shut down the club.
- What? Why?

336
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:34,520
I don't know.
He's just really pissed. Come on.

337
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,942
There you are, you piece of shit.

338
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,639
Tell me why anybody
in their right mind would need
to listen to music this loud!

339
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,807
- What?
- I took a big gamble...

340
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,317
letting you talk me into
this after-hours bullshit.

341
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,319
I'm not licensed for this.

342
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:59,549
I get one call to the cops,
they shut me down forever!

343
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,990
This is Chinatown, Partridge.

344
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,493
- No one fucking lives here.
- I don't care. It's over.

345
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,594
- What about our deal?
- Fuck the deal, and fuck you!

346
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,998
I'm pullin' the plug.

347
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:19,238
Oh, what? Are you gonna hit me
with the bottle now?

348
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:23,280
<i>Oh.! You fucking did it.!</i>
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

349
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:27,316
<i>Ow.! You son of a bitch.!</i>

350
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:40,458
- Shit, Ben.
- What?

351
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,534
I just can't have him
shuttin' the music off.

352
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,934
Just find some rope
and tie this sack of shit up.

353
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:03,646
I used to collect silver dollars
when I was a kid.

354
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,724
I don't collect them.
This is my lucky silver dollar.

355
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,952
You've got two lucky silver dollars?

356
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,291
No, only one.
I just don't know which one.

357
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:15,366
See, I had a lucky silver dollar.

358
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,459
<i>I kept it with me wherever I went.</i>

359
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:23,007
Then someone gave me a plain
old non-lucky silver dollar, and
they accidentally got mixed up.

360
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,008
Same year, same mint.

361
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,513
- So only one is your <i>lucky</i> silver dollar.
- Right.

362
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:33,380
But you can't spend either one because
you don't know which one is lucky.

363
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:37,854
Gosh, Jeffrey. Why don't you just ask
the Fortune Fish which one it is?

364
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,891
Geez, just when I think
you can't be a bigger retard!

365
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,616
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

366
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,652
- Someone's on the rag.
- You got more electricity--

367
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,948
Aah! See?

368
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:14,025
It's not our fault, dear.
Your little house boy told us to do that.

369
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:18,221
How are we supposed to get gorgeous for
your floor show without our hardware, honey?

370
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:20,422
Mitchell, I can't have
the power going out.

371
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,229
- <i>Unplug that mess</i>
<i>and get some extension cords.</i>
-Jesus Christ, Ben!

372
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:27,031
- You know what?
- We're getting ready here!

373
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,710
- Look at you.
- Whoo!

374
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:40,546
Yeah! Like that. Like that!

375
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,893
Hey, Ben, man.

376
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:52,156
- What the fuck?
- I was wondering if you'd seen Chad.

377
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:54,231
- Chad?
- Yeah.

378
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:57,062
I don't know who you are.
How the fuck would I know Chad?

379
00:28:57,168 --> 00:29:00,228
- You'd know Chad if you saw him.
- Oh, I would?

380
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:03,671
Okay. Why don't you go back
to the lounge and sleep it off, pal?

381
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:06,175
Okay.

382
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:25,192
- All yours, Betty.
- Wow.

383
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:28,356
Only an hour and a half late.
Nice work, monkey man.

384
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:31,128
I take shit from Ben.
I like him.

385
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:34,034
I should have the foundation alarms
down in no time.

386
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,267
<i>Make it quick. I was supposed to</i>
<i>blow those holes over an hour ago.</i>

387
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,344
If we're gonna pull this off,
I gotta get the explosives in place.

388
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,346
Look, ass, you can't rush
system hacking.

389
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,939
I got a lot of logic to untangle.

390
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:50,316
It's not like making holes in walls,
so stop bustin' my ovaries.

391
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,321
- <i>Hey.! Race cars.!</i>
- <i>What?</i>

392
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:56,223
You know, race cars!

393
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:34,991
Hey.

394
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,030
Were you staring at my ass?

395
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:42,163
What? No, I-- What?

396
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,901
Came down to get some smokes.

397
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,102
Are you having trouble
with the machine?

398
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:50,670
Yeah. I don't have enough change.

399
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,751
And you were hoping that
the machine would give you a pack...

400
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,184
out of the goodness of its heart?

401
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:59,085
Mm-hmm. It works sometimes.

402
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,159
Well, I happen to know that
that's a female machine...

403
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:06,128
and... your feminine wiles
won't work on it.

404
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,961
Hmm.

405
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,895
<i>Um, how come you've been</i>
<i>ignoring me all night?</i>

406
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,029
What?

407
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,403
Are you kidding me?

408
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,635
Oh, my God.

409
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:23,236
Well, for one thing...

410
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,816
I don't want to replace
another windshield.

411
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:29,318
And... I'm busy.

412
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,480
Busy?

413
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,787
- <i>I was, uh, kinda thinking--</i>
- Quarter.

414
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,670
Asshole.

415
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,808
<i>Oh, my God.!</i>

416
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,435
I am the queen of Truth or Dare!

417
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:57,013
- Whoo! Ow!
- Thank you. Thank you.

418
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,606
You liked that?

419
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:03,517
- <i>Yeah, I did. Yeah. Wow.</i>
- <i>You can go next if you want.</i>

420
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:06,886
- How are we doing with that thing?
- Uh, great.

421
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:09,755
Um, no one's called me
on my cell phone yet.

422
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:14,423
Okay, Rikki.
Keep listening for that call.

423
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,232
- Hey, you're next.
- Next what?

424
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:23,205
<i>We're playing Truth or Dare,</i>
<i>and you're up.</i>

425
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,702
No. I'm running a club here.

426
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:30,440
<i>I'm kind of busy.</i>

427
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:33,176
Truth or dare?

428
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:41,091
- Truth.
- Okay.

429
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,160
I got one.

430
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:48,732
If you were allowed to commit one...

431
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,427
completely immoral...

432
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:55,563
culturally unacceptable act of sin...

433
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:59,268
and the next day
no one would remember...

434
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,345
what would you do?

435
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,548
Good question.

436
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,176
Chad!

437
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:12,256
- Chad?

438
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,917
Chad!

439
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:18,189
<i>Come on, Chad.</i>
<i>Let him go, man.</i>

440
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,389
You're acting like an asshole.

441
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,433
You want me to take you home,
you keep it up, mister.

442
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:26,662
Come on!
Ruinin' the weekend again.

443
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,762
Hey, Ben. How you doin'?

444
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:32,104
Got a snake problem here,
but I can talk him down...

445
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,235
<i>if you just give me a second.</i>

446
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,313
That gets him upset.

447
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:40,077
Uh, Chad, you're gettin' into shit here.

448
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,709
<i>Ben, where are you going, man?</i>

449
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,516
- What's his name?
- Chad.

450
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:49,855
<i>Whoa.! Easy, man.!</i>
<i>He's got a backbone, for Christ's sakes.</i>

451
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:53,089
<i>Can't you, like, sing to him</i>
<i>or something? Sing him a song.</i>

452
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,427
Sing him the magic snake song.

453
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:59,765
- It's all right. Just part of the show.
- Come on. Be nice.

454
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,738
- <i>Just part of the show.</i>

455
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,866
- <i>Whoa.! Heads up.!</i>

456
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,775
You all right?

457
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,784
Yeah.

458
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,446
This your wallet?

459
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:22,220
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

460
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,965
It went in the vent.

461
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,933
- The snake went inside the vent.
- I got it!

462
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,769
- Where does that vent go?

463
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,639
- What the fuck!

464
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:46,410
- Shee!
- Aah! Christ!

465
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:51,117
- Ben, you are not gonna believe this, man.
- Big snake. I know.

466
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,190
Watch out.

467
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,467
It's gone.

468
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,436
- Must have went back up in the vent.
- Ben?

469
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:11,269
- <i>What?</i>
- Remind me never to piss you off.

470
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,280
<i>Yeah, so, uh,</i>
<i>how's everything going down here?</i>

471
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:22,682
- It's good, Ben. It's good.
- Good.

472
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,687
That's really funny.

473
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,058
Don't touch it.

474
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,363
Hello, Ben. Gregory wants to see you.

475
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,434
- Now?
- He didn't specify now.

476
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:39,526
Usually implied with Mr. Gregory.

477
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:44,631
- He'll have to wait.
- No.

478
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:47,973
Now.

479
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,583
Look, if you fuck with me tonight...

480
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:59,315
that may cause me to make a mistake.

481
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:02,984
And if I make a mistake,
the bank alarms will go off.

482
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:07,053
If the bank alarms go off,
guess who Gregory's going to blame.

483
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,292
Me.

484
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,996
And if he gets mad at me and shoots me
and I die, well, that's gonna suck.

485
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:17,563
After he shoots me and I die,
he'll ask you guys to take on my debt.

486
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:21,338
Yeah. You know how the system works.

487
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:24,812
So if you want to
fuck with me tonight, fuck away.

488
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:27,384
Just get out those checkbooks, boys.

489
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,791
- Boo!

490
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:40,523
Fucker.

491
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:59,282
This song sucks, man,
but it's 1:45...

492
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,443
and I'm playing it
just like you asked me to--

493
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,488
- I need you to play it again later.
- No!

494
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,616
- I'll let you know when.
- Dude, you're not listening to me!

495
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,058
The song blows, okay?

496
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,858
People are gonna think
it's my mix if I play this shit twice.

497
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,865
They're gonna think I'm shit!

498
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:19,835
I'll let you know
when to play it again!

499
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,565
Help me, Jesus! Help me!

500
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,639
Hi. Fill it to the top.

501
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,713
All right.

502
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:54,094
- Hey.
- Hey.

503
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,867
- Uh, the name's Roy.
- Ben.

504
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:01,408
You know, Ben, there's, uh...

505
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:04,970
this Chinese myth, says, uh...

506
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:09,542
"When a man saves another's life,
that man is indebted to him forever."

507
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:15,791
Yeah. I think I saw something
on PBS about that.

508
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,986
So I want you to know...

509
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:22,156
if there's ever anything
you need, and I can help...

510
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:26,066
-you just let me know, all right?
- All right. Thanks.

511
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,900
Okay. Thanks again, Ben.

512
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:44,249
- <i>Partridge?</i>

513
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,420
Hey!

514
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:01,002
- <i>What the hell's goin'on, Ben?</i>

515
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:07,073
<i>Master and slave.</i>

516
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,785
Sorry about that scare.

517
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:20,983
Partridge is a real method man.
One of those, uh, Stanislavskys.

518
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:24,858
- It takes all types, I guess, huh?
- Yeah.

519
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:28,420
- Well, we'll see you around, Ben.
- Okay.

520
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,869
What is it?

521
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:37,566
- I gotta tell you something about those guys.
- What?

522
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,939
I can't breathe, man.

523
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,013
I can't breathe.
They're here for us. You know that?

524
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,309
They're gonna nail us, man.

525
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:48,874
- I-- I can't breathe, man.
- You're gonna be fine.

526
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:54,253
How can you tell me I'm gonna
be fine and then tell me there's
undercover feds out there, Ben?

527
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,986
They're gonna catch on to us
and throw us in prison...

528
00:39:57,094 --> 00:40:01,292
and then I'm gonna get fucked in my ass
by some hairy greaseball named Otto.

529
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,800
I'm not gonna let Otto
fuck you in the ass.

530
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,564
You know what? You're not gonna
be able to help me fight Otto...

531
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:11,630
because you're gonna be married
on a completely different
cell block, bent over a sink.

532
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,642
Yeah, with soap and shit.

533
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,941
<i>We're gonna look like donuts</i>
<i>by the time we get out on parole.</i>

534
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,845
- Rikki--
- I can't do this, man.

535
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,248
I can't go out there and do this, okay?

536
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,412
We're not bank robbers, man.

537
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,615
If we pull out now, the alarms go off.

538
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:30,421
<i>Besides, we don't know that it's us</i>
<i>that they're here for.</i>

539
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:34,328
Oh! Then why are they here
if they're not here for us, Ben?

540
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:38,027
- Someone else robbing a bank tonight?
- I don't know.

541
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,463
Aw, shit.

542
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,699
Oh, my God.

543
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,366
<i>Fuck.</i>

544
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:48,445
- Oh, my God! Oh!
- Listen, cook your chicken.

545
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:51,674
It always chills you out.
I'll take care of this.

546
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:55,274
- Relax and deal, Rikki.
I need you tonight.

547
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:58,981
I don't even want my chicken
anymore, Ben!

548
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:04,417
Dirk, the line's
all the way down on the street.

549
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,587
How come we're not staying full?

550
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:09,393
We're getting a lot of fake I.D.'s.
It's all like jail bait.

551
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,334
- So? Let 'em in, man. Let 'em all in.
- Huh? You're kidding.

552
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:16,838
- Come on. Okay, let's go.
- They'll shut us down.

553
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,341
- <i>There you go.</i>
- What the hell are you doing?

554
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:22,503
- Single file.
- You no have club no more!

555
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:25,878
Lots of room for ya.
Get drunk. Be loud! Be really loud!

556
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,110
<i>Okay. All right. There you go.</i>

557
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:31,347
- <i>You'll never promote a club again.!</i>
- I don't give a shit.

558
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:50,231
- I'm winning.
- You can't win. It's a loop, idiot.

559
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,309
- You just go around it.
- I'm ahead of you.

560
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:55,105
I was always the best
at racing and I still am.

561
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:00,178
- Three points!
- <i>What do you mean, "three points"?</i>

562
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:03,185
<i>Three points.! I passed you.</i>
<i>That's three points.</i>

563
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,755
Where the hell is that rule?
There's no points.

564
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:09,417
- It's racing.
- That's the way I've always played it.

565
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,087
It wasn't three points, motherfucker.

566
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,630
- <i>I just passed you. I get three points.</i>
- <i>No, you don't.</i>

567
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:17,530
- <i>Why not?</i>
- You bumped me when you passed.
I get two more points.

568
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:20,502
Fuck you and your points!
There's no goddamn points.

569
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:23,903
You just pull the trigger and make
your car go around. Oh, fuckin'--

570
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:26,476
- Thanks, asshole!
- Take a chill pill.

571
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:29,045
I'm trying to make up
some lost time here.

572
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:32,115
- How am I supposed to work with
you picking on the autistic?
- Hey!

573
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,242
You know what?
Fuck the both of you.

574
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,220
<i>My cousin picked this up</i>
<i>in Mexico last week.</i>

575
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:50,164
- Says it works like a charm.
- Right on, man.

576
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:52,235
<i>You're so thoroughly immoral.</i>

577
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:57,069
Immoral? This just lets her express herself.
What's so immoral about that?

578
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:02,265
Yoo-hoo. Ben, baby, honey,
can you zip me up?

579
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:06,475
Oh, my God.
Get back in there.

580
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:14,344
I can't wait to see what
you guys do with that thing.

581
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:16,715
<i>Oh, Maurice?</i>
<i>He got the night off.</i>

582
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:21,621
Ever since you volunteered your older
friend to be our bitch boy tonight.

583
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:29,665
- <i>There you are.</i>

584
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,997
So what is it?

585
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:33,763
What's what?

586
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:37,102
What's your truth?

587
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:41,166
You can't stop something
you've already started.

588
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,448
Yeah, tell me about it.

589
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,782
Oh, shit.

590
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,490
Ben?

591
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,589
<i>Hey, man, uh--</i>

592
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:05,226
- Hey, Kitten. Hi.
- What is it, Rikki?

593
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:07,132
-Jake!
-Jake?

594
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,400
God?

595
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:18,208
Uh, hey, Ben.
How's it goin', man?

596
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:23,642
What the fuck
are you doing up here?

597
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,949
Just taking a little break, man.

598
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,923
- Whoo!
- Rikki!

599
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:33,495
You're fucking fired!

600
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,964
You're kidding.
You can't do it without me.

601
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:44,871
Yeah, but we can't do it
with you now, can we?

602
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:47,842
- What did you take?
- <i>Don't know.</i>

603
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:51,403
I drank some, uh...

604
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:53,915
<i>drink. </i>

605
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,977
I don't think that was gin
in that thing, though, Ben.

606
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:05,694
I feel love!

607
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:13,036
<i>Fine. You work stoned, then.</i>

608
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:16,004
Get in the basement, bitch.

609
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:19,439
Get in the basement, bitch!

610
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:22,671
All right. Okay. Okay.

611
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:26,716
- <i>Fuck.!</i>

612
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:33,888
Hey, Ben!

613
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:36,516
Have you seen Jake?

614
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,562
I think I pissed him off!

615
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:46,330
Ah! What? Jeffrey!

616
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:49,132
Holy shit!

617
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:52,299
Jeffrey! Jeffrey!

618
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:55,378
- He's having an epileptic seizure.
- You're kidding!

619
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,413
<i>Must be the lights.</i>

620
00:46:57,514 --> 00:47:01,382
Stick something in his mouth so he
doesn't swallow his tongue, like a spoon.

621
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,476
Come on.
Whatever you got. Hurry up.

622
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:07,387
- Yeah, go.

623
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:11,689
There. Help me get him out of here,
someplace where the lights aren't so crazy.

624
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:13,695
- How 'bout downstairs?
- No!

625
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:18,359
I mean, how 'bout outside?
He probably needs fresh air, right?

626
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:20,595
All right. Let's go.

627
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:29,441
<i>So, uh, thanks for the help in there.</i>

628
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:32,606
Michael Frakes.

629
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:35,116
Ben McGewan.

630
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:38,416
<i>We should really</i>
<i>get him to a hospital.</i>

631
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:42,390
He's probably gonna be fine,
but he needs to see a doctor.

632
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,824
What?

633
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:48,727
Well, we can't take him to a hospital.

634
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:53,064
Why the hell not? The poor guy
just had a fucking seizure.

635
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,070
Hold on.

636
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:04,580
There was this thing on <i>Nova.</i>

637
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:07,548
They discovered a totally
isolated clan of people...

638
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:09,846
in a remote region of Greenland.

639
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:13,286
They were living in a technologically
medieval microculture.

640
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,359
The Untladhavns.
Yeah, no kidding.

641
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,088
And when they sent in
this cultural anthropologist...

642
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:22,654
he discovered
that these people never lied.

643
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:25,564
They didn't even have a word for it.

644
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,933
Hmm.

645
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:30,029
That's great for them.

646
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:34,099
But I bet the Untladhavns never
found themselves in an alley
with Jeffrey the epileptic...

647
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,111
being held together
by an F.B.I. Agent...

648
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:40,547
inches away from discovering the robbery
that they'd planned for six months.

649
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:43,677
So fuck the Untladhavns.

650
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:47,949
- Christian Scientist.
- What?

651
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,958
He's a Christian Scientist.

652
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:54,326
He doesn't believe in doctors,
so he'll refuse any treatment
they offer him anyway.

653
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:58,891
- He thinks God will take care of him.
- You're kidding.

654
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:01,994
I wouldn't lie about something like that.

655
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,198
Man.

656
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,877
Now what happened?

657
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:19,155
Don't ask.

658
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:23,359
Just make sure he doesn't
swallow his tongue.

659
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:32,801
Whatever.

660
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,637
Aw, shit.

661
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:49,011
I hate cats.

662
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,485
I had one once.

663
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:55,718
Never came to me when I called it.

664
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,592
Finally made me so mad,
I drowned it in the kitchen sink.

665
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,290
That's amazing, isn't it?

666
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:09,037
That it could make me that mad.

667
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:13,208
When I say I want to see you,
I mean now.

668
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:17,269
Now. Not in 10 minutes,
not a half an hour later. Now.

669
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,349
I just had--

670
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,116
Shut up.

671
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:31,959
You're getting cocky, Benjamin.

672
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:36,465
In this business, it doesn't behoove me
to have cocky underlings.

673
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:39,967
Do I make myself perfectly clear?
You may answer with one word.

674
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,173
- Yes.
- Good.

675
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:52,880
Now, then...

676
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,952
I want a status report.

677
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:00,488
Everything's fine.

678
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:05,293
See? That wasn't so hard, was it?

679
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,831
Be back here at 5:00.

680
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,679
<i>Okay, I'm done.</i>

681
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:30,014
Better late than never.
Let's make those holes.

682
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,782
<i>Let's make those holes.!</i>

683
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:36,347
<i>How is that ape supposed to use</i>
<i>explosives in his condition?</i>

684
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,827
Betty, shut up!

685
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,398
<i>I work better stoned.</i>

686
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,767
I don't know.
He seems fine to me.

687
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:47,837
<i>Yeah, I vote he does it.</i>

688
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,338
- Are you gonna be down here when he does it?
- Fuck you! No.

689
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,307
- I'm hungry.
- Hey, Jeffrey.

690
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:57,642
<i>Did you have a nice nap? Do you</i>
<i>want to be a bank robber again?</i>

691
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:00,443
How come you didn't tell me
you're an epileptic?

692
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,518
Because then you wouldn't
have hired me.

693
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,587
What?

694
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:10,217
That's some fucked-up shit.

695
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:14,286
Rikki, go back upstairs.

696
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:16,865
Everybody else, get back to work.

697
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,696
So I'm not fired?

698
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:22,067
No, Jeffrey, you're not fired.
You're just an asshole.

699
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:25,975
I'm starved too.
Can we get some chow first?

700
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:29,739
Fine. There's a Chinese place
across the street that delivers.

701
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:34,146
<i>No.! Garlic chicken.!</i>

702
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:38,984
Garlic! Chicken! Yes!

703
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:41,717
There you go!

704
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:52,226
Did I say pork?

705
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,360
No. I didn't.

706
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:56,735
Chicken. Thank you.

707
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,001
I want four orders of that.

708
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,577
Uh, two with wonton soup.

709
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,849
We're at 616 Empire Avenue.

710
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:11,950
Across the street from you!

711
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:15,852
Oh, thank you. Yeah.
That's Ben McGewan.

712
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:19,962
Hi. What you doin'?

713
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:23,032
Food. You having a good time?

714
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:26,432
Not yet, hot pants.
Wanna take a walk?

715
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,629
Thanks, but I'm kind of busy.

716
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:31,104
See, you still haven't
answered your truth...

717
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:35,167
and I say your time's up,
so that means I get a dare.

718
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:37,746
Do you want to hear my dare?

719
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:43,886
Really?

720
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:48,552
Oh, you know, it's, um--

721
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:52,150
Yeah, I'm kind of busy, so-- I'm workin'.

722
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:56,358
- And, you know, we really can't do this.
- Sure, we can. Watch.

723
00:53:56,466 --> 00:54:00,061
Oh-- Oh, okay.

724
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,434
- I deserve this.

725
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:04,268
Mm-hmm.

726
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:09,004
I should-- Kitten.
Kitten, stop. Okay?

727
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:13,412
Trust me. You got no idea
how bad I want this.

728
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:16,917
- But not now.
- Then what about this?

729
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:25,959
- No.
- <i>Ben. Hi.</i>

730
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:28,587
Uh, l-I was just
coming down to, uh...

731
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:31,633
see when the Chinese food was comin'.

732
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:36,297
But it kinda looks like you're
already getting dim sum.

733
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:38,567
Fuck you, Rikki.
It's nothing.

734
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:42,270
It's nothing?
Fuck you, Ben.

735
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:44,347
Hey, Kitten.

736
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:14,068
We're good. Let's do it.

737
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,259
It's that time.

738
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:33,625
<i>Play that record again.</i>

739
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:37,029
I think I might've lost it. Oh, well,
I'll just play something good.

740
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:39,192
Play it again, or you're dead!

741
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,207
That's the song.

742
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:38,318
Still on-line. We're good.

743
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:42,956
<i>Yup. One more explosion,</i>
<i>we got ourselves a new door.</i>

744
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:52,234
<i>Knock, knock.!</i>
<i>Sorry about your soup, man.</i>

745
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:56,836
<i>Totally got jostled on the dance floor,</i>
<i>and it got kind of screwed.</i>

746
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:59,574
- <i>Who the hell are you?</i>
- You ordered Chinese food, right?

747
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:03,015
Well, that's me.
Chinese food delivery guy. Here.

748
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:07,078
- Scott, is that you?
-Jeffre y Jay? Holy shit, man!

749
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,026
How long has it been?

750
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:13,652
Six years!

751
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:16,323
-<i>So what are you doing now?</i>
- Still robbin' banks.

752
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:20,267
- Well, so what are you doing here?
- Robbin' a bank.

753
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,804
<i>Oh. No shit.</i>

754
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:24,703
Hey, can I watch?

755
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:27,106
- No. Fuck off!
- He can't.

756
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,440
He's seen everything.

757
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:32,709
- You know what? Maybe I should fuck off.
- <i>No.</i>

758
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:37,515
So ahead. Have a seat
and have some Kung Pao Chicken.

759
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:42,289
I said have a seat and have some
Kung Pao Chicken!

760
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,127
You be good now.

761
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:54,294
Oh! Oh, g--

762
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:57,635
Whoo!

763
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:01,340
Holy shit!

764
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:03,571
<i>Whoo.!</i>

765
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,513
- Whoo-hoo!
- What's up?

766
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:11,914
Oh, I'll tell you what's up.

767
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:14,285
Uh, guess what I just did.

768
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:17,257
Starts with the letter "F,"
ends with the letter "ucked."

769
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,591
- No shit.
- Oh, yeah.

770
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:23,188
You dog.

771
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:26,097
- <i>So, who is she?</i>
- Huh?

772
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:29,171
Oh, oh, she's, uh, just some--

773
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:32,036
just this hot, hot
little blonde girl.

774
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,041
You know, just hot.

775
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:38,102
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

776
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:40,682
Yeah, these dirty
little meat flowers nowadays...

777
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:43,513
they'll just strip and jump
your donkey anywhere.

778
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,521
- Apparently, yeah.
- No shit! Yeah!

779
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:51,719
- So, is she young?
- Yeah, kind of. Ooh.

780
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:54,763
I like 'em young.
You like them young?

781
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:57,697
I like them when they're young,
but they know their way around.
You know what I mean?

782
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,462
- Yes, sir, I do know.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

783
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:03,038
Yeah.

784
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:05,039
So, where is she now?

785
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:08,633
- <i>El bao.</i>

786
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:10,645
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Oh, yeah.

787
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:13,648
- <i>Oh.!</i>
- 'Cause I was thinking, you know...

788
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,742
maybe I'll get a little
sloppy seconds, huh?

789
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:20,050
Rikki, I'm still purring.

790
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:22,147
Sure thing, Kitten.

791
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:28,625
- Susan?
- Susan?

792
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,494
Daddy?

793
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,000
Daddy?

794
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:30,285
Ben! Please! Oh, God!
Help! Help me!

795
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:36,691
<i>Wanna dance? We'll dance.!</i>

796
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,063
<i>We're not done.</i>
<i>We're goin'back to</i> el bao.

797
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:42,660
<i>You filthy fucking whore, piece</i>
<i>of shit, cocksucker bastard.!</i>

798
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:47,175
- Who called her meat flower?
You did. I didn't call her--

799
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:49,574
- Hey!

800
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,738
- What?
- What'd you do, Rikki?

801
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:54,749
What did he do?
You wanna know what he did?

802
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:58,116
He had sex with
my 16-year-old daughter!

803
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,883
- Sixteen?

804
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:04,391
- Daughter?
- Yes!

805
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,327
I swear to God, she said she was 17.
Ben, I swear--

806
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:09,364
<i>Motherfucker.!</i>
<i>You stupid fuck.!</i>

807
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,695
This music sucks, man!

808
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:19,775
Can you play something more nasty?

809
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:22,037
I wanna get nasty!

810
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:41,087
He's fucking with the song!

811
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,358
It's like you fucked part of me!

812
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,798
He's fucking with the song.

813
01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:51,130
- Don't anyone move! I'll be right back!
- Where are you going?

814
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:19,328
- Fuck!

815
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:25,237
What the hell was that?
Sounds like it came from downstairs.

816
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:27,571
Beats me.
I'll go check it out.

817
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:31,238
- I'll go with you.
- That's okay. I got it covered.

818
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:35,249
What's the matter? You got a dead body
downstairs or something?

819
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:44,986
Fuck!

820
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,825
What the hell is going on in here?

821
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:57,338
<i>Oh, hey there. Got here as soon as you</i>
<i>guys called about those electrical surges.</i>

822
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,534
- And who are you?
- Sparkz Electronics.

823
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:03,874
You guys hear that?
Tiny little electrical pop.

824
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,380
<i>Probably sounded</i>
<i>loud as hell upstairs.</i>

825
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:11,442
<i>This fuse box has fuses</i>
<i>in it and wires that go up.</i>

826
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:14,250
<i>And over here is a air duct...</i>

827
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:18,054
<i>and that air duct</i>
<i>is right behind the fuse box.</i>

828
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:21,562
Together they probably
made it very loud upstairs
when the surges happened.

829
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:24,565
<i>I'm gonna put some overtime in on this.</i>

830
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:27,534
I'll have it ready
for the kitchen in the morning.

831
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:31,338
I guess that explains it.

832
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:35,603
These are fuse lists.

833
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:38,305
I'll go over them,
figure out which one it is.

834
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:50,989
Okay.

835
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:56,664
- Okay.
- Okay.

836
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,398
- That's 11 -C.
- Good. Good.

837
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,551
Who the fuck is this?

838
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:18,711
He came down here to deliver
the Chinese food and saw everything.

839
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:21,984
- <i>I couldn't let him go.</i>
- What the hell is going on
up there with the record?

840
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:25,458
- Rikki?
- Hey, leave Rikki alone, all right?

841
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:28,792
Oh, shit! Rikki!

842
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:35,064
The myth! That old Chinese
myth you told me about.

843
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:37,731
- <i>Back off, Ben.!</i>
- <i>Stop it.!</i>

844
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:41,537
I saved your life.
I saved your life, Roy.

845
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:43,544
Now give me his.

846
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:46,706
<i>Will you let go of me,</i>
<i>please? Thank you.</i>

847
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:50,912
This doesn't end here, all right?

848
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:55,389
I'm a federal agent, and I'm arresting
his ass for statutory rape!

849
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:58,153
- Come on. We're going home.
- No! Dad!

850
01:04:58,261 --> 01:04:59,751
Okay, stop. No hitting.

851
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:02,490
Fuck you, Ben!
This is all your fault anyway!

852
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:05,692
If I tell you
the "truth or dare" answer...

853
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:08,269
would you leave... for your dad?

854
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,420
Hey, Ben.

855
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:38,031
I got her number, though.

856
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:41,433
- That's good, Rikki.
- I got her phone number.

857
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:15,399
What was the truth you told her
to get her to leave?

858
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:20,407
Uh, I told her I wish it had been me
instead of you that got to be with her.

859
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:22,943
I'm sorry, man.

860
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:30,742
It's just-- I hadn't been laid
in over a year, you know?

861
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:34,846
Stuff like this doesn't happen
to guys like me every day.

862
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:37,858
Ah, don't worry about it.

863
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:41,157
Nobody's dead... yet.

864
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,830
I'm such a complete loser.

865
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:50,205
I said don't sweat it.

866
01:06:56,245 --> 01:07:00,113
You know, things never
went Kevin's way either.

867
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:02,446
But he meant well.

868
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:06,754
That's what counts, Rikki.

869
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:13,661
Ben?

870
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:19,033
Who shot him?

871
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:25,306
I don't know.

872
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:33,749
-Jin Sun.
- McGewan.

873
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:36,647
I told you if I caught you
back in Chinatown again...

874
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:39,550
I'd mail you back to Gregory
one piece at a time.

875
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:42,590
<i>Who does Gregory think he is?</i>

876
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:45,387
<i>I had an agreement with that guy.</i>

877
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:48,327
Chinatown's mine.

878
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:51,059
What can I say, Jin Sun?

879
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,931
You got me by the balls here.

880
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:59,735
<i>I'm just doing what</i>
<i>Gregory tells me to do.</i>

881
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:04,074
So let me get this straight.

882
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:06,876
You get that statue
out of the bank vault at 4:30...

883
01:08:06,982 --> 01:08:10,418
- <i>but Gregory doesn't</i>
<i>expect you until 5:00.</i>
- Yeah.

884
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:14,182
Let me tell you what I'm gonna do
for you, McGewan, because I like you.

885
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:17,191
I'm gonna let you finish your little gig
in my neighborhood tonight...

886
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:19,284
<i>but you cut me in on the deal.</i>

887
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:21,829
That's fine by me, but
Gregory's not gonna go for it.

888
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:26,129
I'm pretty sure Gregory won't have much
of a choice if I have the statue, will he?

889
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:33,337
I guess we have a deal.

890
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:36,639
I'll see you 4:30 a.m., Benji.

891
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:04,704
Hey, thank you
for saving us back there.

892
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,968
No problem.
Anything for a Theta brother.

893
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:11,913
You realize you're an accessory
to a pretty major felony, right?

894
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:15,745
- That's cool.
-Just checking.

895
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:20,151
Okay, Jeffrey, we are way the hell
behind schedule, so let's make time.

896
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:22,884
You know which vaults, right?

897
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,927
Yeah, of course.

898
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:52,085
<i>Ben? Are you down here?</i>

899
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,986
Hey! Would you like to go for a drink?

900
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:57,991
Yeah. I thought you'd never ask.

901
01:09:58,093 --> 01:10:01,085
- Great.
- What are you doing in here?

902
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:43,471
Try to shove my head
in a toilet again, asshole.

903
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:50,511
You look upset.

904
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:52,513
Gee, you think?

905
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:55,641
You know, you worry too much.

906
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:58,481
If you'd just relax a little bit...

907
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:01,112
things would come to you.

908
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:06,689
- Can I ask you a question?
- Mm-hmm.

909
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:10,663
I've been trying to get your
attention for like a year now...

910
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:14,862
and other than that night that you
threw rocks and shit at my car...

911
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:18,701
-you haven't shown me
the least bit of interest.
- And?

912
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,138
Why tonight?

913
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:27,341
Out of all the nights on
the Christian calendar, why tonight?

914
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:33,019
I don't know.

915
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:38,116
There's just something about you
tonight that's kind of cute.

916
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:40,195
I mean--

917
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:42,730
You know what?
I hate you.

918
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:45,527
- Yeah.

919
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,795
I hate you.

920
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:51,736
I hate women like you.

921
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,536
I hate women that look like you.

922
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:58,739
I hate mannequins that wear
clothes that look like clothes
that you might wear.

923
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:01,748
I hate your perfume
and everyone that wears it.

924
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:04,580
I hate your friends
because they get to be near you.

925
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:07,747
But most of all, I hate your bed.

926
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:11,485
Because every night I know
that's right where I will never be.

927
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:15,529
PBS, last Tuesday night.
<i>The Australian Outback.</i>

928
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:18,725
There was this bird
called the Orindinkie.

929
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:22,895
You've heard about the black widow spiders
eating their lovers after they mate?

930
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:25,769
It's got nothing on the Orindinkie.

931
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:30,470
You see, just after mating,
the male chills out, takes a nap.

932
01:12:30,579 --> 01:12:35,243
That's when the female comes up,
rips open its chest...

933
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:38,149
and eats its heart.

934
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:42,656
Scientists think she does this to insure
that he never mates again...

935
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:46,216
giving her offspring
a better chance at life.

936
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:50,230
Me? I got my own theory.

937
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:53,563
I think it's because she's just a bitch.

938
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:55,864
So fuck you!

939
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:58,462
Fuck you!

940
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:29,504
Oh, yeah!

941
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:13,372
It's empty. It's empty!

942
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:28,293
<i>No, Jeffrey,</i>
<i>don't you do it. Don't--</i>

943
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:32,366
<i>Put the fish back.!</i>

944
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,867
No.

945
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:37,996
- <i>No, no, no.!</i>
- <i>Put it down, Jeffrey.! Put it down.!</i>

946
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:40,904
<i>Drop it.!</i>

947
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:44,570
- <i>Retard.!</i>

948
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:00,018
<i>You dick.!</i>

949
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:04,064
Ben? Hey, uh, uh--

950
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,932
Look, Ben, you got a major problem, man.
The vault's empty.

951
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:09,901
What?

952
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:13,031
Ow! Ow!

953
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:16,008
I didn't even come yet, you asshole!

954
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,449
- Is he dead?
- I don't think so.

955
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:25,577
<i>If you look real close,</i>
<i>you can see the little fucker</i>
<i>twitch every couple of seconds.</i>

956
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:28,747
- <i>What about the second vault?</i>
- <i>He never got that far.</i>

957
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:32,020
<i>When he got to the vault where</i>
<i>the statue was supposed to be</i>
<i>and it was empty...</i>

958
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:34,152
he lost his shit.

959
01:15:34,263 --> 01:15:36,891
He was fine until he
pulled that fish out.

960
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:39,900
Second vault? I thought you guys
were stealing a statue or something.

961
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:43,403
- We are.
- So the statue's in two safes?

962
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:46,963
<i>No. The statue's in one vault.</i>
<i>The other vault has--</i>

963
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:54,807
<i>Wait a second. Why am I</i>
<i>explaining this to you?</i>

964
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:56,908
<i>I don't know.</i>

965
01:15:57,019 --> 01:15:59,078
Okay, think.

966
01:15:59,187 --> 01:16:02,623
The statue's gotta be in here!

967
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:08,927
Betty, jump the system,
find out where they put it.

968
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:15,402
Look, I appreciate your help,
but I'm giving you your out now.

969
01:16:15,504 --> 01:16:18,337
Maybe you should
get back to work.

970
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,533
The shit's about to hit the fan.

971
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:24,169
No way, man. Besides, they're
closing in a few minutes, anyways.

972
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:28,147
<i>Closing? What do you mean, closing?</i>
<i>It's a 24-hour restaurant.</i>

973
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,514
Spray for bugs!

974
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:35,352
You sent me to a restaurant that needs
to close down to spray for fuckin' bugs!

975
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:39,154
Do you know how I feel about
being this close to the scene?

976
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,195
It makes me very
fucking uncomfortable!

977
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:45,062
Mr. Gregory,
you didn't have to come here.

978
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:48,102
I have things under control.

979
01:16:48,203 --> 01:16:51,001
Why don't I bring it
to your office tomorrow morning?

980
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:54,166
You said yourself you've waited
10 years for this thing.

981
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:57,768
<i>You can wait another night.</i>

982
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:04,516
I trust you just enough to break into
this bank and get the statue for me.

983
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,817
I do not trust you to put the statue
in your car and drive it to my office.

984
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:11,381
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

985
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:16,396
I'm sorry! Look,
if you're uncomfortable...

986
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:18,830
why don't you go
someplace nearby?

987
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:22,995
You know perfectly well there's not
another place to wait in Chinatown.

988
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:26,165
You knew that place was
shutting down, didn't you?

989
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:29,835
I know you, you little shit!

990
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:41,687
Okay. This office is yours.

991
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:44,725
I'll bring it to you once I get it.

992
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:49,320
You cross me, and you will wish
you were dead, McGewan.

993
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:55,099
<i>Don't you get it, Rikki?</i>
<i>It's over.</i>

994
01:17:55,203 --> 01:17:57,933
We're not gonna get the statue.

995
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:02,841
Gregory's gonna kill me.

996
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:07,847
And after he kills me, Jin Sun's gonna
bring me back to life so he can kill me too.

997
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:13,050
It's over.

998
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:15,282
So you're quitting?

999
01:18:16,892 --> 01:18:20,225
That's bullshit, Ben!
It's total bullshit, man!

1000
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:38,636
A couple of months ago,
I was at your place.

1001
01:18:38,747 --> 01:18:42,046
I wanted to watch the Hustler Channel,
but you made me sit there...

1002
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:46,382
and watch some shit fuckin'
nature special you had on, remember?

1003
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:52,524
About a bunch of gazelle
or something, right?

1004
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:55,391
It was some country I never
heard of. Probably Africa.

1005
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:57,988
Oh, my God, Rikki,
I'm gonna die.

1006
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,330
Yeah, I know, okay!

1007
01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:07,664
Just don't interrupt me anymore.
I'll forget where I was going.

1008
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:12,475
Anyway, the narrator
was this English guy...

1009
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:17,109
and he had a stick so far up his ass,
he could probably taste pine, you know?

1010
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:22,384
<i>He talked a lot of shit, most of which</i>
<i>I forgot before he was even done talking.</i>

1011
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:27,155
I mean, who knew there was so much crap
to talk about fucking gazelle, right?

1012
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:29,787
- <i>Who actually gives a shit?</i>
- Are you making a point here?

1013
01:19:29,898 --> 01:19:33,231
Yes! You see...

1014
01:19:33,335 --> 01:19:38,102
lions... eat gazelle.

1015
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,712
And the gazelles
fucking hate that shit.

1016
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:48,271
This narrator guy was saying
that one day on the shoot...

1017
01:19:48,383 --> 01:19:53,218
that a lion snuck up
on the cameraman, right?

1018
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:56,051
This camera guy,
he was like a native.

1019
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:58,353
He'd been doing this shit all his life.

1020
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:02,794
The narrator said that there's one sure way
to stop a lion from attacking you.

1021
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:05,196
Don't turn and run.

1022
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:09,030
See, that's what the gazelles do.

1023
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:12,231
It doesn't work for them,
and they get eaten anyway.

1024
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:15,776
But this camera guy,
he knew what to do.

1025
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:21,472
Fucking charged that lion.

1026
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:24,916
Just ran at that lion,
stark-raving mad...

1027
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,920
screaming and shit, right?

1028
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:30,014
Just charges the fucking lion.
And you know what?

1029
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:34,953
The lion turned and ran.

1030
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:39,399
Why?

1031
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:46,098
I don't know.

1032
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:49,939
You went into the kitchen,
and I turned it to the Hustler Channel.

1033
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:52,775
<i>There was this special on it</i>
<i>called "Beaver Boat."</i>

1034
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:57,113
Just like any other
fishing show, you know.

1035
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:59,687
<i>But not exactly.</i>

1036
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:03,588
Instead of two fat guys fishing,
it was these two naked babes.

1037
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:08,356
You'll never believe
what they used for bait, Ben.

1038
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:12,195
Turns out something was wrong
with the air-conditioning
in the statue's first safe.

1039
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:16,999
The statue's so old, they need to keep it
at 60 degrees so it doesn't deteriorate.

1040
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:19,972
So they moved it down here
to a subbasement.

1041
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:22,543
<i>Controlled environment safes.</i>

1042
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:24,703
It's in safe B-2-63-54.

1043
01:21:24,813 --> 01:21:27,976
You can get to the subbasement through
this electrical conduit in the floor here.

1044
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:30,142
Okay.

1045
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:33,619
We've got 20 minutes
to make everything happen.

1046
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:37,715
<i>Two safes to crack,</i>
<i>no safecracker.</i>

1047
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,128
We could blow 'em open.

1048
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:44,596
That's risky. If you pop the vault doors off,
you could set off the alarms.

1049
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:47,668
No choice.
We're out of options.

1050
01:21:47,769 --> 01:21:50,636
<i>How much grease</i>
<i>you got left, Jake?</i>

1051
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:55,501
Two finger coils...
for emergencies.

1052
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:57,669
I'd say this just about counts.

1053
01:21:57,779 --> 01:22:00,646
<i>What size doors</i>
<i>are we talking about here?</i>

1054
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:03,650
Like wall safes. One foot
by one foot each, maybe.

1055
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:07,415
And you gotta pop a hole
in the floor to get to the subbasement.

1056
01:22:07,522 --> 01:22:09,786
I guess it'll do the trick.

1057
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:12,325
Who goes?
Jeffrey's fucked.

1058
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:14,327
One of us.

1059
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:18,094
<i>I'll go.</i>
<i>I know the explosives.</i>

1060
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:20,394
<i>Guess again.</i>
<i>You're too heavy.</i>

1061
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:23,403
<i>Jeffrey only had that cord</i>
<i>set for 350 pounds.</i>

1062
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:25,405
<i>You go, then.</i>

1063
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:28,635
<i>Someone's gotta track the alarms.</i>
<i>I stay with my laptop, pal.</i>

1064
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:30,836
<i>I can do it.</i>

1065
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:33,244
<i>No offense, but when</i>
<i>this makes the books...</i>

1066
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:36,408
as the most fucked-up
bank job in history...

1067
01:22:36,518 --> 01:22:38,713
for all the mistakes
that I did make...

1068
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:42,278
I don't want to be credited with sending
the Chou-Wang food guy to blow the safe.

1069
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,460
Ben, what do you weigh?

1070
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:52,699
<i>Uh, just 10 more minutes, I promise.</i>

1071
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:56,002
Hey.

1072
01:22:57,405 --> 01:22:59,498
Ben's just, um--

1073
01:22:59,607 --> 01:23:02,701
He's just getting
the statue ready for you.

1074
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:06,372
He's cleaning it up
a-and stuff, you know.

1075
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:12,544
Where the hell is Ben, and
what the hell is all this shit
about some safe being empty?

1076
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:22,086
Look, bitch, I don't know who
you are or what you're cranked up on...

1077
01:23:22,197 --> 01:23:25,223
but you better
get outta here right now.

1078
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:28,769
Blow me, Rikki.
Tell Ben to fuck off too!

1079
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:40,238
That's... drugs.

1080
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:43,374
She's probably on some hard drugs.

1081
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:46,545
<i>All the hard drugs...</i>

1082
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:50,784
that kids are doing
these days at these parties--

1083
01:23:50,892 --> 01:23:53,952
All right. That's enough.

1084
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:55,962
<i>Hold him down.</i>

1085
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:57,895
Okay.

1086
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:19,720
Which is the way down, Betty?

1087
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:23,450
Shit. Under Jeffrey.

1088
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:26,652
Fuck me.

1089
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:23,183
<i>Michael, check out the southeast</i>
<i>door. That could be our guy.</i>

1090
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,550
We're on.

1091
01:26:19,908 --> 01:26:22,342
I'm gonna ask this once.
That's all.

1092
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:25,207
If you don't tell me
what Ben is up to right now...

1093
01:26:25,313 --> 01:26:28,612
you're going to find out exactly what
happened to Ben's brother Kevin.

1094
01:26:28,716 --> 01:26:33,016
And then I'm going to find Ben
and do the same thing to him.

1095
01:26:55,243 --> 01:27:00,442
We broke into the safe that we thought
the statue was in, but it's not there.

1096
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:04,382
It's in another one, and Ben's
gonna bring it to you right now.

1097
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:06,715
You expect me to believe that?

1098
01:27:06,821 --> 01:27:09,790
It's true! I swear to God!
I don't know anything else!

1099
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,950
I don't believe you.

1100
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:15,928
Something's going on around here,
and you know what it is.

1101
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:18,897
No, there isn't.
Nothing's goin' on, I swear.

1102
01:27:31,613 --> 01:27:34,173
Okay. I'll tell you.

1103
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:38,344
Just let me up.

1104
01:27:38,453 --> 01:27:42,082
I can't breathe.
Will you let me up? I can't--

1105
01:27:45,493 --> 01:27:48,087
Ever had your fortune told, asshole?

1106
01:27:54,535 --> 01:27:56,594
Time to go?

1107
01:27:56,704 --> 01:27:58,604
Yeah, it's time.

1108
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:15,781
You don't have the balls.

1109
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:18,017
For Kevin, I do.

1110
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,826
Oh, shit.

1111
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:43,349
Left.

1112
01:28:47,255 --> 01:28:49,883
Freeze! F.B.I.!
Up against the wall, cocksucker!

1113
01:28:54,195 --> 01:28:56,561
Fortune Fish.

1114
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:58,564
Oh, shut up!

1115
01:29:10,311 --> 01:29:13,838
Wait. Not yet.

1116
01:29:13,948 --> 01:29:16,508
I want Benjamin to see this.

1117
01:29:23,891 --> 01:29:26,155
<i>Jin Sun, that little bitch.</i>

1118
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:29,229
I knew something was up.
Come on.

1119
01:29:31,299 --> 01:29:35,030
- What the fuck?
- Up against it, I said!

1120
01:29:35,136 --> 01:29:37,570
All right, you're under arrest,
you piece of shit.

1121
01:29:37,672 --> 01:29:41,108
<i>This is fucked up.!</i>

1122
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:44,303
- <i>There's more than one vault open.</i>
- <i>I know.</i>

1123
01:29:44,412 --> 01:29:46,778
<i>It's all fucked up, man.!</i>
<i>He's taking us for a ride.</i>

1124
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:48,872
<i>Would you shut up</i>
<i>and let me think?</i>

1125
01:29:48,983 --> 01:29:51,952
What the fuck is going on here?

1126
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:54,954
- You tell me, prick.
- You barbarian shitbag.

1127
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:58,219
You think you can just shoot my guy,
steal my property and get away with it?

1128
01:29:58,326 --> 01:30:00,226
Who the fuck do you think you are?

1129
01:30:00,328 --> 01:30:03,058
<i>You talk big for someone</i>
<i>who's operating in my backyard.!</i>

1130
01:30:03,164 --> 01:30:05,792
- You put your fucking gun down.
- You put <i>your</i> fucking gun down.

1131
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:08,926
- 
- You put your fucking gun down!

1132
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:10,970
Fuck you!

1133
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:13,165
- Right now!

1134
01:30:13,274 --> 01:30:16,334
Who the fuck do you
think you're talking to?

1135
01:30:16,444 --> 01:30:19,413
<i>I'm not gonna fucking repeat myself!</i>

1136
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:24,817
- Bring it!

1137
01:30:26,454 --> 01:30:28,649
Fucker!

1138
01:30:39,567 --> 01:30:43,298
<i>Put your fucking gun down,</i>
<i>you fucking fairy.!</i>

1139
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:48,035
Let's go!

1140
01:30:54,715 --> 01:30:57,411
- Come on!
- Drop your fuckin' gun!

1141
01:31:00,421 --> 01:31:03,720
- <i># Sayonara #</i>
- What's going on, Gregory?

1142
01:31:03,825 --> 01:31:06,623
- Where the hell is that coming from?

1143
01:31:06,727 --> 01:31:09,127
Down there.

1144
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:27,374
<i># Sayonara #</i>

1145
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:44,993
<i>Come on.!</i>

1146
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:48,692
Come on!
Let's go, guys!

1147
01:31:48,803 --> 01:31:50,703
Come on.
Come on, Rikki.

1148
01:31:50,805 --> 01:31:54,536
Ben! Listen, you peep!

1149
01:31:54,642 --> 01:31:58,043
First of all, don't ever
walk out on me like that again!

1150
01:31:58,145 --> 01:32:00,579
Second of all--
Who the fuck are you?

1151
01:32:15,463 --> 01:32:18,193
Okay, first...

1152
01:32:18,299 --> 01:32:21,894
I'd like you to tell us what the hell
this piece of crap is.

1153
01:32:22,003 --> 01:32:23,903
- Revenge.
- Huh?

1154
01:32:24,005 --> 01:32:28,271
Chu Jung, the Chinese god
of fire and revenge.

1155
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:31,971
<i>Okay, Gregory,</i>
<i>thanks for the mythology lesson.</i>

1156
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:34,946
<i>But that really</i>
<i>only explains one safe...</i>

1157
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:37,882
and we got
a couple empty safes here.

1158
01:32:37,985 --> 01:32:41,978
- Where's the money
that was in that fucking safe?
- What money?

1159
01:32:42,089 --> 01:32:45,081
Hey, where'd we get all this money?

1160
01:32:45,192 --> 01:32:47,626
From Gregory's personal vault.

1161
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:51,061
Oh, that's what you were
stealing from the second safe.

1162
01:32:51,165 --> 01:32:52,826
What second safe?

1163
01:32:52,934 --> 01:32:55,801
Wait. Rikki didn't know
about the money safe?

1164
01:32:55,903 --> 01:32:58,428
Sorry I had to keep it
from you, Rikki.

1165
01:32:58,539 --> 01:33:00,769
<i>I just figured you had</i>
<i>enough on your mind.</i>

1166
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:03,503
Besides, if Gregory wanted
to know what I was doing...

1167
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:07,240
I figured he'd find out from you and
sometimes it's just better not to know.

1168
01:33:08,716 --> 01:33:13,119
<i>That's all right.</i>
<i>Whoa, whoa, hold on.</i>

1169
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:16,519
Why'd you fuck Gregory
like that, though, Ben?

1170
01:33:19,493 --> 01:33:21,859
Because he killed Kevin.

1171
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:28,131
I thought you didn't know
who killed him.

1172
01:33:28,235 --> 01:33:30,430
So did Gregory.

1173
01:33:30,538 --> 01:33:32,438
Big mistake.

1174
01:33:34,976 --> 01:33:37,206
What did you do
with the fucking cash?

1175
01:33:37,311 --> 01:33:39,677
Cash? Me? What are you talking about?

1176
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:42,806
- There was $2 million in there!
- Kiss my ass!

1177
01:33:42,917 --> 01:33:48,412
Look! I don't know what
the fuck's going on here...

1178
01:33:48,522 --> 01:33:51,821
but I do know that you two guys
are in a bank vault...

1179
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:56,363
there's a hole in the wall,
safes are blown, shit's missing.

1180
01:33:56,464 --> 01:33:59,490
<i>You gotta trust me on this one, guys.</i>

1181
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:03,366
<i>You're gonna go down.</i>
<i>Now get 'em outta here.</i>

1182
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:11,642
<i>Wanna hear something great?</i>

1183
01:34:11,746 --> 01:34:15,739
<i>That was Gregory's laundered money we took</i>
<i>from the safe, kept there under an alias.</i>

1184
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:20,082
<i>The fucker got arrested</i>
<i>for stealing from himself.</i>

1185
01:34:20,187 --> 01:34:22,348
<i>Couldn't do anything about it.</i>

1186
01:34:22,456 --> 01:34:24,890
<i>The feds have been trying</i>
<i>to nail him for a long time...</i>

1187
01:34:24,992 --> 01:34:27,187
<i>and this is just</i>
<i>what they were waiting for.</i>

1188
01:34:27,294 --> 01:34:31,663
<i>Twenty years in Leavenworth,</i>
<i>suckin' dick for cigarettes.</i>

1189
01:34:31,766 --> 01:34:34,894
<i>And Jin Sun? He was just</i>
<i>in the wrong place at the wrong time...</i>

1190
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:36,936
<i>and the feds tagged him too.</i>

1191
01:34:37,038 --> 01:34:39,598
<i>Gregory still blames him for everything.</i>

1192
01:34:39,707 --> 01:34:42,676
<i>You know, Jin Sun would have walked</i>
<i>away clean if he hadn't tried to fuck me.</i>

1193
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:05,799
<i>The night turned out to be</i>
<i>a pretty good night after all.</i>

1194
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:10,394
<i>One of those memories that's better after</i>
<i>the fact than when it's actually happening.</i>

1195
01:35:10,504 --> 01:35:14,406
<i>I mean, I got the money,</i>
<i>I got revenge...</i>

1196
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:16,305
<i>and nobody got killed.</i>

1197
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:19,208
<i>Hell, Rikki even got laid.</i>

1198
01:35:19,313 --> 01:35:22,111
<i>As a matter of fact,</i>
<i>I got everything I wanted.</i>

1199
01:35:22,216 --> 01:35:24,116
<i>Even the girl.</i>

1200
01:35:26,754 --> 01:35:29,314
<i>Okay, maybe not the girl.</i>

1201
01:35:29,423 --> 01:35:31,323
<i>But everything else.</i>
