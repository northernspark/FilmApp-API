{33911}{33969}- Can they do that?|- This one did.
{33971}{34010}So they tell me. Twice.
{34018}{34134}Either that or some airhead over at NORAD|misread a glitch on his monitor.
{34140}{34204}It also came down slower|than suborbital speed.

{39361}{39392}All right, what is it?
{39397}{39427}I{y:i}'ll know more in two hours.
{39429}{39497}We{y:i}'re taking it out now|and setting up a lab in Madison.
{39502}{39589}This meteor, the Chequamegon sighting,|appears to be hollow?
{39598}{39679}No, not {y:i}"appears to be{y:i}." It is hollow.
{39727}{39793}I think the balloon has just gone up, sir.
{40109}{40193}Do you have to keep that thing|on your lap like that?
{40200}{40278}Those things{y:i}...|Guns make me a little bit jumpy.
{40291}{40350}Define {y:i}"little bit jumpy{y:i}."
{40387}{40430}That{y:i}'s a little bit.
{40466}{40551}Jumpy{y:i}'s like nervous, afraid.
{40573}{40612}You know that word {y:i}"afraid{y:i}"?
{40614}{40656}{y:i}"Afraid{y:i}." Yes.
{40696}{40747}How much English do you understand?
{40756}{40839}I understand greetings|in 54 planet Earth languages.
{40865}{40983}I understand English language little bit.
{41120}{41188}Nothing much in there.|It{y:i}'s just a lot of junk.
{41211}{41256}That{y:i}'s my wallet.
{41462}{41514}That{y:i}'s my driver{y:i}'s license.
{41618}{41697}That{y:i}'s me. My name, Jenny Hayden.
{41706}{41741}{y:i}"Jenny Hayden{y:i}."
{41792}{41834}What do you want, anyway?
{41843}{41889}Why did you come here?
{41948}{41980}Oh, my God.
{42039}{42078}I look like Scott.
{42207}{42238}Yeah, you do.
{42337}{42379}I look like Scott...
{42390}{42469}...so you do not be little bit jumpy.
{43713}{43800}Listen, about those police calls,|you did say anything weird, right?
{43802}{43865}- You got something?|- Just picked up one from Ashland.
{43867}{43904}Happened sometime this morning.
{43906}{44006}A guy name Heinmuller had a collision|with an orange and black {y:i}'77 Mustang.
{44008}{44065}The gal driving claimed|she was being kidnapped.
{44070}{44159}But when Heinmuller went to help her,|the kidnapper...
{44168}{44226}...yelled, {y:i}"Greetings{y:i}"|and melted his lug wrench.
{44245}{44298}Yelled, {y:i}"Greetings{y:i}"|and melted his lug wrench?
{44300}{44340}Weird you want, weird you get.
{44345}{44384}How do you melt a lug wrench?
{44386}{44445}I just copy them down,|I don{y:i}'t explain them.
{44471}{44583}- Did anybody get a license number?|- Wisconsin plates, Papa X-ray Victor 2-3-7.
{44585}{44644}We{y:i}'re checking the owner|through DMV now.
{45275}{45320}What the hell is that thing?
{45340}{45401}Well, it{y:i}'s sort of an invitation, Major.
{45407}{45474}Remember that package|we sent up with the {y:i}Voyager probe?
{45486}{45541}There was a gold anodised disk...
{45544}{45620}...with greetings from Earth|in 54 different languages.
{45622}{45697}Complete with a nice little speech|from Kurt Waldheim:
{45699}{45810}{y:i}"To whom it may concern.|Come and see us sometime{y:i}."
{45912}{45951}We{y:i}'re coming to a gas station.
{45953}{46037}- We{y:i}'re gonna need some gas. Okay?|- {y:i}"Gas{y:i}"?
{46050}{46077}Gas.
{46109}{46158}For the car. Fuel.
{46172}{46206}Energy.
{46229}{46336}I step on the gas, the car goes,|I take my foot off, it stops. Understand?
{46348}{46413}No. I do not understand.
{46461}{46524}How can car need energy so soon?
{46548}{46626}I don{y:i}'t know.|I{y:i}'m just telling you, this is the gas gauge.
{46628}{46736}When the needle gets to E, that{y:i}'s {y:i}"Empty{y:i}."|No gas. The car stops. Period.
{46752}{46777}Okay.
{46791}{46822}Get gas.
{47264}{47313}- Here you go.|- Take it easy.
{47317}{47369}Yeah. Take it easy.
{47484}{47508}Hi.
{47510}{47571}- Fill her up, unleaded.|- Gas.
{47601}{47631}Gotcha.
{47945}{47981}Yeah, I know.
{47999}{48051}I have to go to the bathroom.
{48054}{48111}The ladies{y:i}' room. The restroom.
{48171}{48246}It{y:i}'s when a person has to{y:i}...
{48287}{48367}The hell with it,|you figure it out for yourself, I{y:i}'m going.

{49941}{49967}Gas.
{49979}{50044}Yeah, well, I know just how she feels.
{50566}{50636}Every goddamn place you go.
{50720}{50756}Take it easy.
{50812}{50844}Up yours.
{51032}{51069}Take it easy.
{51135}{51172}Up yours.
{51488}{51523}Hi, let{y:i}'s go.
{51641}{51695}Nothing of interest in here.
{52401}{52476}You wanna sign that for me, Ms. Hayden?
{53161}{53203}Kidnapped.
{53262}{53290}What?
{53391}{53435}What is...
{53481}{53542}{y:i}..."kidnapped{y:i}"?
{53803}{53858}You want to know what kidnapped is?
{53881}{53964}It{y:i}'s being dragged out of your house|in the middle of the night...
{53966}{54025}...by some whatever you are.
{54032}{54143}Being forced to drive all night at gunpoint|and not knowing where you{y:i}'re going...
{54145}{54217}...or what{y:i}'s going to happen to you|when you get there.
{54219}{54299}So if you{y:i}'re going to shoot me, go ahead.
{54337}{54426}Because I{y:i}'d rather be shot|than go on being scared to death.
{54562}{54597}Go ahead.
{54949}{55024}I mean you no harm, Jenny Hayden.
{55350}{55434}{y:i}Here's OI' Blue Eyes, Francis Albert.
{55899}{55970}{y:i}"Start spreading the news
{56000}{56072}{y:i}"I{y:i}'m leaving today
{56091}{56184}{y:i}"I want to be a part of it
{56204}{56298}{y:i}"New York, New York{y:i}"
{56341}{56374}I{y:i}'m sorry.
{56387}{56428}I did awaken you.
{56610}{56691}Do they sing a lot where you live?
{56738}{56796}Yes. We sing.
{56841}{56896}Do you ever get hungry?
{56977}{57022}Empty here?
{57048}{57104}Like a car needs gas?
{57122}{57152}Yes.
{57221}{57289}This body has a terrible emptiness.
{57296}{57340}This is called {y:i}"hungry{y:i}"?
{57342}{57429}Yeah, and when people get hungry|they have to eat food.
{57455}{57514}Eat. Yes, we must do that.
{57545}{57638}We will stop at food station.|You have hungry too?
{57659}{57695}I{y:i}'m starving.
{57713}{57762}I haven{y:i}'t eaten since{y:i}...
{57844}{57871}Oh, my God.
{57908}{57953}Look out! What are you doing?
{58156}{58184}Okay?
{58199}{58247}Okay? Are you crazy?
{58249}{58299}You almost got us killed.
{58330}{58401}You said you watched me.|You said you knew the rules!
{58403}{58438}I do know the rules.
{58440}{58520}For your information,|that was a yellow light back there.
{58576}{58629}I watched you very carefully.
{58664}{58791}Red light: Stop. Green light: Go.|Yellow light: Go very fast.
{58841}{58913}- You better let me drive.|- I will drive.
{58960}{59047}Do you seriously expect me|to tell the President...
{59057}{59109}...that an alien has landed...
{59116}{59235}...assumed the identity of a dead|housepainter from Madison, Wisconsin...
{59237}{59315}...and is presently out|tooling around the countryside...
{59321}{59422}...in a hopped-up|orange and black 1977 Mustang?
{59445}{59507}We have the following givens:
{59523}{59637}That man, Scott Hayden, died last April.|He{y:i}'s dead and buried, that{y:i}'s verified.
{59642}{59694}He has no brothers or lookalike cousins.
{59696}{59755}But still, this morning,|at approximately 6:00...
{59757}{59828}All right, we have been through all of that.
{59835}{59895}I{y:i}'m going to ask you now,|how could it happen?
{59904}{59969}We think it might be|some kind of a cloning deal...
{59971}{60039}...replication of an entire organism|from a single cell.
{60041}{60096}We found some hairs|from Scott Hayden{y:i}'s head.
{60098}{60125}Is that possible?
{60129}{60213}I mean, can you clone a living organism|from the hair of a dead man?
{60226}{60281}Human hair consists of keratinised cells.
{60283}{60356}But in order to determine|whether replication is possible...
{60363}{60402}I asked you a question.
{60413}{60444}You mean us?
{60446}{60503}- In our present state of technology?|- Yes.
{60515}{60580}- No.|- What the hell are we talking about?
{60584}{60635}We{y:i}'re hypothesizing a technology...
{60637}{60703}...that{y:i}'s probably|100,000 years ahead of us.
{60705}{60759}We{y:i}'re the ancients, Mr. Fox.
{60784}{60809}{y:i}"Ancients{y:i}"?
{60811}{60880}Technologically, yes. We{y:i}'ve just started.
{60914}{60976}Even if you{y:i}'re right, I still have problems.
{60978}{61013}His knowledge of English.
{61031}{61076}Okay, listen to this.
{61137}{61190}I helped put this package together.
{61192}{61256}This was designed|so that an intelligent species...
{61258}{61314}...could get|a working knowledge of English.
{61316}{61351}Enough to get by, anyhow.
{61353}{61425}A couple-of-hundred-word vocabulary,|a rough idea of syntax.
{61434}{61526}Think of what it would mean to talk|to a being from a civilisation like that.
{61528}{61576}Think of what we could learn.
{61578}{61621}{y:i}... of 147 member states...
{61623}{61730}...w{y:i}ho represent almost all|{y:i}of the human inhabitants of planet Earth...
{61737}{61763}{y:i}... I send greetings...
{61765}{61838}{y:i}"Greetings,{y:i}" that{y:i}'s what he said|to Heinmuller on the road.
{61841}{61905}It{y:i}'s also what the cannibal said|to the missionary...
{61907}{61958}...just before he ate him.
{61960}{62049}Now the question in this case is:|Who is the missionary...
{62055}{62092}...and who are the cannibals?
{62170}{62212}When do you have to be there?
{62234}{62259}What?
{62290}{62360}In Arizona. When do you have to be there?
{62421}{62475}Do you see this little star?
{62536}{62599}Star? What star? Where?
{62664}{62693}There.
{62747}{62792}We call that the sun.
{62823}{62872}When this little{y:i}...
{62891}{62932}When the sun...
{62963}{63076}...appears mid-sky three more times,|I must be at Arizona.
{63078}{63175}You mean, 12:00 noon,|three days from now?
{63184}{63211}Yes.
{63233}{63305}What happens|if you don{y:i}'t get there in time?
{63329}{63378}Then they will go.
{63385}{63445}- Without you?|- Yes.
{63472}{63511}What will you do then?
{63513}{63571}Then I will die.
{63588}{63615}Die?
{63793}{63827}Understand?
{63992}{64043}You look for food station.
{64888}{64914}What?
{64983}{65011}A deer.
{65043}{65079}A dead deer.
{65118}{65157}{y:i}"Dead deer,{y:i}" why?
{65181}{65279}People hunt them to eat for food.
{65323}{65366}Do deer eat people?
{65380}{65406}No.
{65413}{65475}Do people eat people?
{65482}{65537}No, of course not.|What do you think we are?
{65571}{65645}I think you are a very primitive species.
{65714}{65766}What are you, softhearted?
{65784}{65828}Cry when you saw {y:i}Bambi?
{65839}{65885}Define {y:i}"Bambi{y:i}."
{65887}{65951}He doesn{y:i}'t understand.|He{y:i}'s not from around here.
{65965}{66023}You don{y:i}'t speak any English?
{66110}{66150}Steer clear of that bozo.
{66175}{66217}Define {y:i}"bozo{y:i}."
{66234}{66259}Jerk.
{66339}{66393}From Denver, here{y:i}...
{66493}{66571}It{y:i}'s south on Interstate 25.
{66589}{66660}Then you pick up l-40 westbound|at Albuquerque.
{66662}{66759}Will you forget the deer for a second?|I{y:i}'m trying to show you something.
{66761}{66861}Where exactly in Arizona|are you supposed to meet your friends?
{67010}{67051}West of Winslow.
{67066}{67133}I see a little speck on the map,|but there{y:i}'s{y:i}...
{67145}{67176}Crater?
{67190}{67275}Is that where you{y:i}'re supposed|to meet them? Where the meteor hit?
{67277}{67313}Why do you do this?
{67369}{67445}Better safe than sorry.|Just in case something happens to me.
{67447}{67491}There{y:i}'s one more thing.
{67515}{67558}The credit card, for the gas.
{67560}{67651}- You know how that worked?|- Why should something happen to you?
{67763}{67796}Who knows?
{67817}{67917}The way you drive, travelling with you|could be detrimental to the health.
{68129}{68154}That{y:i}'s...
{68204}{68259}...me and Scott on our honeymoon.
{68323}{68366}A honeymoon is...
{68412}{68461}...what you call it when...
{68504}{68574}...two people first get married and they...
{68600}{68659}...go off together|after they{y:i}'ve fallen in love.
{68692}{68722}Define {y:i}"love{y:i}."
{68844}{68881}Love is{y:i}...
{68996}{69047}It{y:i}'s when you care...
{69103}{69181}...more for someone else|than you do for yourself.
{69214}{69272}But it{y:i}'s not just that, it{y:i}'s{y:i}...
{69325}{69436}It{y:i}'s when someone is a part of you.
{69485}{69522}And when they{y:i}...
{69629}{69657}What?
{69728}{69765}Scott is dead.
{69789}{69834}He was killed in an accident.
{69927}{69979}When someone you love...
{70026}{70067}...dies{y:i}...
{70131}{70162}Shit.
{70287}{70322}Define {y:i}"shit{y:i}."
{70368}{70440}Don{y:i}'t say that, that{y:i}'s not a nice word.
{70499}{70524}Shit.
{70560}{70648}Don{y:i}'t mind him,|he{y:i}'s just learning to speak English.
{70652}{70705}He{y:i}'s got a hell of a start on it.
{70707}{70768}Who{y:i}'s the devilled egg on white toast?
{70770}{70795}His.
{70806}{70875}Right. And a superburger.
{70886}{70972}Two orders of fries, two choc malts...
{70982}{71045}...and two Dutch apple pie|with whipped cream.
{71065}{71118}I had a wedge of it myself.
{71123}{71192}It{y:i}'s terrific. Enjoy.
{71261}{71296}Dig in.
{71369}{71457}Wait. No. That{y:i}'s your dessert.
{71481}{71531}You eat that with a fork.
{71556}{71632}This thing. Here.
{71640}{71673}Like this.
{71735}{71807}No, but you eat that last.
{71815}{71869}Sandwich first, dessert last.
{71901}{71928}Why?
{71967}{72034}I don{y:i}'t know, that{y:i}'s just how it{y:i}'s done.
{72236}{72278}What{y:i}'s the matter?
{72328}{72368}Dutch apple pie.
{72398}{72426}Good?
{72478}{72515}It{y:i}'s terrific.
{72651}{72706}For a primitive species we have our points.
{72708}{72816}Anybody for Lincoln, Omaha or Chicago,|the bus leaves in five minutes.
{73050}{73130}I{y:i}'ve got to go to the{y:i}...
{73213}{73252}I{y:i}'ll be right back.
{73553}{73637}Excuse me,|is there a back way out of here?
{73640}{73703}Yeah, sure, through the kitchen. Why?
{73760}{73822}- You know that fellow I came in with?|- Yes.
{73838}{73927}Could you give these things to him|after the bus leaves?
{73929}{74011}It{y:i}'s just a map and some car keys|and a credit card.
{74013}{74110}- You sure, honey?|- Yeah, I{y:i}'m positive. Thanks.
{74171}{74205}Hey, honey.
{74216}{74274}I wouldn{y:i}'t go out|through the back door right now.
{74276}{74364}That friend of yours,|he{y:i}'s out there in the parking lot.
{74417}{74447}Thanks.
{76006}{76082}Excuse me, miss.|You strike me as a meat-eater.
{76084}{76140}I could fix you up|with a nice haunch of venison.
{76142}{76198}Maybe even a shot of pork if you could{y:i}...
{76257}{76296}Why, that son of a bitch.
{76305}{76330}No.
{76440}{76508}Hey, what happened to the goddamn deer?
{76537}{76594}He went there, to the woods.
{76604}{76642}Okay, comedian.
{76696}{76725}Bingo.
{76761}{76806}Stop it. You leave him alone!
{76809}{76856}- Butt out, girlie.|- He doesn{y:i}'t understand.
{76858}{76926}- He{y:i}'s a foreigner and doesn{y:i}'t speak English.|- So what?
{76928}{76955}Hey!
{77018}{77047}{y:i}"Bingo{y:i}."
{77665}{77713}Here, you{y:i}'re losing your English, boy.
{77883}{77945}Pick up your garbage and get going.
{78157}{78229}Oh, Jesus. You okay?
{78231}{78336}I thought guns make you a little bit jumpy,|Jenny Hayden.
{78338}{78395}You make me a little bit jumpy.
{78437}{78519}I thought I told you to stay away|from those bozos.
{78600}{78660}It{y:i}'s okay. I think I understand.
{78984}{79032}It looks better that way.
{79034}{79082}Thank you, Jenny Hayden.
{79211}{79271}All part of our friendly service.
{79364}{79392}You okay, honey?
{79394}{79422}I{y:i}'m all right.
{79424}{79511}I wanted to tell you|that eastbound bus is about to go.
{79513}{79564}Want me to try to hold it?
{79686}{79751}No, thank you. Never mind.
{79753}{79809}Thanks, but never mind.
{79832}{79865}Good luck.
{80188}{80262}I{y:i}'m gonna get that bastard, Donnie Bob.|Right now.
{80449}{80486}Hey, look out!
{80570}{80598}Take it easy!
{80605}{80649}Up yours.
{80663}{80705}I{y:i}'m gonna get that son of a bitch.
{81287}{81382}It{y:i}'s their fault, the Mustang.|Son of a bitch hit me and just took off.
{81384}{81411}Anybody get his number?
{81413}{81530}No, but it won{y:i}'t be too hard to pick up.|1977 Mustang, Wisconsin plates on it.
{81740}{81797}That Mustang them State boys wanted{y:i}...
{81799}{81865}- Orange and black {y:i}'77, Wisconsin plates?|- Yeah.
{81867}{81950}Well, kick her in the ass,|I think we got the bastard.
{82152}{82231}We{y:i}'ve been here since 6:30 p.m.|When can we leave?
{82233}{82329}As soon as the Federals say so,|and not one damn minute before.
{82595}{82646}Everybody tells it|pretty much the same way.
{82648}{82742}She had chances to get away from him,|but they left together with her driving.
{82744}{82818}Does that sound like any kind|of kidnapping you ever heard of?
{82821}{82848}Mr. Shermin!
{82850}{82921}They spotted an orange and black|Mustang, Wisconsin plates...
{82923}{82959}...going west near Big Springs.
{82961}{82990}Great.
{83068}{83169}Scott and I met two winters ago|up at Iron Mountain, ice-skating.
{83209}{83280}I had on this little tight skating outfit.
{83338}{83429}I was showing off. He kept staring at me.
{83491}{83554}One thing lead to another|and a few months later...
{83556}{83599}...we were on our honeymoon.
{83625}{83667}Honeymoon is nice?
{83686}{83740}Yeah, ours was beautiful.
{83807}{83848}Define {y:i}"beautiful{y:i}."
{83856}{83975}Beautiful is better than terrific...
{84010}{84073}...better than Dutch apple pie.
{84123}{84159}The best.
{84194}{84227}The best.
{84721}{84808}Gotta get a couple of hours sleep.|Just a couple, okay?
{85498}{85527}{y:i}Do not approach them.
{85529}{85597}{y:i}Keep them under surveillance|{y:i}until the Feds get there.
{85605}{85654}But what if they approach us?
{85656}{85725}{y:i}In a life-threatening situation,|{y:i}defend yourselves.
{85727}{85781}{y:i}Otherwise, w{y:i}ait for the Feds.
{85790}{85827}Wait for the Feds.
{85829}{85922}They get the 6:00 news,|and we get the shit end of the stick.
{85924}{85963}That{y:i}'s the way it is.
{85965}{86036}Yeah, well, it doesn{y:i}'t have to be that way.
{86039}{86157}I got a hunch, this might just develop|into a life-threatening situation.
{86173}{86281}Hi. We{y:i}'d like a room for the night.|As far away from this as possible.
{86341}{86398}Boy, am I whipped.
{86449}{86543}My mom always said there wasn{y:i}'t a thing|wrong with the world that a hot bath...
{86545}{86605}...and a good night{y:i}'s sleep couldn{y:i}'t fix.
{86731}{86771}What am I doing?
{86787}{86821}I must be getting punchy.
{86823}{86898}It{y:i}'s just that in that light|you look so much like Scott.
{86900}{86980}- I wasn{y:i}'t thinking.|- You said the nose is different.
{86982}{87007}What?
{87013}{87072}You said, {y:i}"Your nose is different.
{87075}{87189}{y:i}"He broke his twice and there{y:i}'s something|else, something spooky about your eyes{y:i}."
{87196}{87241}That{y:i}'s word for word.
{87250}{87309}You remember everything you hear|word for word?
{87312}{87391}Everything I hear, everything I see.|Everything{y:i}...
{87450}{87505}Everything this body feels.
{87677}{87708}The tub.
{87719}{87798}{y:i}The questions are w{y:i}orth 30 points apiece.|{y:i}Jane, tell us about it.
{87800}{87835}{y:i}Your final category today is...
{87972}{88033}{y:i}Believe me, General.|{y:i}I know w{y:i}hat w{y:i}ent w{y:i}rong.
{88035}{88080}{y:i}The X-factor w{y:i}asn't red.
{89191}{89253}{y:i}I never knew {y:i}it could be like this.
{89256}{89321}{y:i}Nobody ever kissed me the w{y:i}ay you do.
{89329}{89359}{y:i}Nobody?
{89368}{89406}{y:i}No, nobody.
{89432}{89508}{y:i}Not even one?|{y:i}Out of all the men you've been kissed by?
{89544}{89596}{y:i}Well, that'll take some figuring.
{89598}{89639}{y:i}How {y:i}many men you think there've been?
{89641}{89693}{y:i}I w{y:i}ouldn't know.|{y:i}Can't you give me an estimate?
{89695}{89790}{y:i}Not w{y:i}ithout an adding machine.|{y:i}You have your adding machine w{y:i}ith you?
{89792}{89837}{y:i}I forgot to bring it.
{89842}{89913}{y:i}Then I guess you w{y:i}on't find out, w{y:i}ill you?
{89927}{89985}Hey there, buddy. Are you in there?
{90091}{90183}It{y:i}'s none of my business, but if that{y:i}'s|your Mustang in the parking lot...
{90185}{90241}...there{y:i}'s two cops trying to jigger the lock.
{90759}{90811}The bastards ran one on us!
{91031}{91071}Papa Charlie 3.
{91073}{91139}Suspects in Mustang heading south|on Big Springs{y:i}' bypass.
{91141}{91175}We are in pursuit.
{91603}{91635}He{y:i}'s got a gun.
{91700}{91726}No!
{91957}{91992}Jenny Hayden?
{92103}{92132}Jenny Hayden?
{92273}{92329}{y:i}Papa Charlie 3.
{92331}{92420}{y:i}Suspects on l-80 proceeding northbound.|{y:i}Still in pursuit.
{94415}{94479}It sounds impossible,|but I have people that say...
{94481}{94554}...they saw him carrying her out|of the burning wreckage.
{94556}{94602}Then they disappeared in the smoke.
{94604}{94694}I{y:i}'ve had the police check the entire area|and there are no bodies.
{94696}{94730}Oh, thanks.
{94733}{94819}I assume that they{y:i}'re still alive|and they{y:i}'re probably headed west.
{94821}{94873}I{y:i}'m going to Grand Junction, Colorado.
{94875}{94983}The Army is setting up some kind|of a roadblock on l-70. I{y:i}'m going.

{103962}{103997}I make maps.

{105150}{105186}You all right?
{105247}{105298}You{y:i}'re not from around here, are you?
{105798}{105835}What the John?
{105868}{105926}Some kind of roadblock, I guess.
{105954}{105997}{y:i}"Roadblock, I guess{y:i}."
{106341}{106403}Keep them in line.|They{y:i}'re slipping around the end.
{106405}{106454}Yes, sir. Sergeant, you heard the man.
{106460}{106545}Right away, sir. Get in line. Line up.
{106682}{106744}Move to the right and stay in line.
{106836}{106930}Stay in line. All you pedestrians, line up.
{107212}{107307}Line up. Move to the right and stay in line.
{107480}{107508}Oh, no.
{107618}{107646}You gotta help me, okay?
{108111}{108200}Stop him! After that car! After him!
{109137}{109193}Thank God! How did you get here?
{109201}{109258}I hitched a ride with a cook.
{109317}{109378}It{y:i}'s good to see you, Jenny Hayden.
{109509}{109571}We gotta get out of here. Come on.
{110322}{110389}I{y:i}'ve done something wrong, Jenny Hayden?
{110555}{110611}I wake up alone. You{y:i}'re gone.
{110619}{110664}Not a word. Nothing.
{110727}{110817}You were right.|To be with me is not good for your health.
{110863}{110963}You could have at least told me|where you were going. Said goodbye.
{111025}{111056}{y:i}"Goodbye{y:i}"?
{111081}{111112}Goodbye.
{111206}{111252}You don{y:i}'t know what{y:i}...
{111268}{111305}Teach me this.
{111357}{111417}Well, I don{y:i}'t know. It{y:i}'s a custom.
{111450}{111479}It{y:i}'s...
{111532}{111626}...how you tell somebody|that you{y:i}'ll miss them...
{111628}{111696}...that you wish them well.
{111737}{111787}That you hope{y:i}...
{111838}{111901}Her tooth coming in{y:i}. Pobrecita.
{112011}{112068}Can anyone have babies?
{112155}{112189}Just women.
{112239}{112325}I understand the reproductive process|as you know it.
{112369}{112406}As we know it?
{112513}{112553}You have a baby?
{112592}{112618}No.
{112646}{112679}No babies.
{112759}{112790}Why not?
{112890}{112977}Scott and I wanted to have a baby.
{113003}{113098}It just turned out I couldn{y:i}'t.
{113158}{113245}I{y:i}'m one of those lucky ladies that just...
{113301}{113344}...can{y:i}'t have one.
{114059}{114111}Here, a blanket! It{y:i}'s dry.
{114830}{114899}You better get out of those wet clothes.
{114931}{114971}Better get warm.
{115005}{115063}You know what pneumonia is? No?
{115069}{115164}Well, you{y:i}'re gonna find out|unless we get you dry in a hurry.
{115357}{115399}Here, put this on.
{118623}{118639}Hi there.
{118641}{118705}Mr. Fox has been delayed.|He{y:i}'s going to be late.
{118707}{118735}What{y:i}'s going on here?
{118737}{118851}According to our estimates, that object|was headed for someplace in Arizona.
{118855}{118940}Intelligence thinks the visitor is on his way|to make a rendezvous.
{118942}{119007}Go on inside. Make yourself at home.
{119689}{119738}Welcome to planet Earth.
{120383}{120419}Where are we?
{120473}{120539}I think we are coming to Winslow soon.
{120912}{120959}Why didn{y:i}'t you wake me?
{120961}{121012}I like to watch you sleep.
{121067}{121107}I don{y:i}'t know why.
{121141}{121177}It{y:i}'s strange.
{121202}{121276}I think I am becoming|a planet Earth person.
{121310}{121367}Do you have to go back?
{121422}{121493}Isn{y:i}'t there some way you could stay?
{121529}{121582}No. I must go back.
{121802}{121892}But there is something I must tell you.
{121946}{121997}I gave you a baby tonight.
{122061}{122087}No.
{122120}{122186}That{y:i}'s impossible. I can{y:i}'t have a child.
{122192}{122276}I{y:i}'ve been to a doctor, a couple of them.
{122278}{122327}Believe what I tell you.
{122394}{122428}A boy baby.
{122505}{122592}He will be human,|a baby of your husband, but...
{122598}{122650}...also he will be my baby.
{122711}{122833}He will know everything I know and when|he grows to manhood he will be a teacher.
{123003}{123061}If you do not want this baby...
{123091}{123148}...tell me now, I will stop it.
{123920}{123994}Which is your star?|Can you see it from here?
{124002}{124029}Why?
{124067}{124142}I want to show him|where his father came from.
{124349}{124378}There.
{124419}{124445}No.
{124498}{124525}Wait{y:i}...
{124635}{124665}There...
{124675}{124711}...low in the sky.
{124756}{124785}There.
{124816}{124848}I see it.
{125002}{125052}You{y:i}'d better get dressed.
{125058}{125108}We are coming to Winslow.
{125181}{125246}I hope to God we{y:i}'re on the right train.
{125248}{125336}I don{y:i}'t know,|that looks awful big for Winslow, Arizona.
{125984}{126014}No.
{126096}{126129}Las Vegas!
{126154}{126182}What?
{126229}{126307}I think we{y:i}'ve gone|about 300 miles past Winslow.
{126343}{126398}We{y:i}'re still going to be okay.
{126404}{126470}All we gotta do is rent a car,|and with a little luck...
{126472}{126531}...we{y:i}'ll be back there|before noon tomorrow.
{126557}{126626}Just try not to be too conspicuous, okay?
{126633}{126664}Come on.
{126811}{126894}$500,000, folks!|Who{y:i}'s gonna take it home?
{126896}{126975}Hit the giant jackpot|and your troubles are over!
{126980}{127017}$500,000, folks.
{127019}{127078}Define {y:i}"giant jackpot{y:i}."
{127085}{127144}A giant jackpot is a lot of money.
{127146}{127232}Money? Geetus, bread, an arm and a leg?
{127234}{127269}Where did you get that?
{127273}{127329}We don{y:i}'t have time|to fool with the slot machines.
{127331}{127388}We gotta find a rent-a-car place and{y:i}...
{127441}{127483}Where{y:i}'s my wallet?
{127497}{127534}- My wallet.|- What is wrong?
{127536}{127590}Where the hell is my wallet?
{127638}{127671}What are we gonna do now?
{127682}{127713}Is all right.
{127715}{127794}But you don{y:i}'t understand.|No credit card, no money, no car.
{127796}{127861}- We{y:i}'re never going to get there on time.|- Is all right.
{128044}{128071}Now.
{128230}{128258}Damn!
{128654}{128742}That{y:i}'s a handy talent you got there|but you better spread it around.
{128744}{128846}These guys get kind of curious|if you hit too many jackpots at once.
{129622}{129706}Choppers from the Air Cav|will search the area on a quarter-mile grid.
{129708}{129763}- Good, I{y:i}'m glad you{y:i}'re here.|- What is this about?
{129766}{129813}You{y:i}'re a man|of some scientific attainment.
{129818}{129899}Don{y:i}'t you recognise an emergency|autopsy room when you see one?
{129909}{129942}With leather tie-straps?
{129956}{130007}You behave yourself, Mark.
{130039}{130068}Is this your latest update?
{130070}{130108}According to NORAD...
{130110}{130208}...his original course and rate of descent|would have taken him here...
{130217}{130240}...south of Winslow.
{130242}{130280}I see. Anything else?
{130282}{130330}The Cobra guys|were asking about ammunition.
{130332}{130408}Helicopter attack units|will carry live ammo at all times.
{130415}{130480}- This is to be considered a combat mission.|- Right.
{130553}{130637}Listen, Mr. Fox,|I{y:i}'d like to be a team player...
{130639}{130705}...but I want to call something|to your attention.
{130707}{130780}If there{y:i}'s one thing I don{y:i}'t need,|it{y:i}'s a lecture on morality.
{130782}{130831}All right, okay, screw morality.
{130833}{130900}What happened to good manners?|We invited him here.
{130902}{130964}- I have no time for this.|- I{y:i}'m trying to make a point.
{130966}{131003}So am I, damn it.
{131009}{131091}You make a great show of being a rebel,|but the fact is this:
{131102}{131165}You are a GS-11 public servant.
{131179}{131242}Anytime that becomes|too much of a burden...
{131245}{131353}...you can go back to Cornell,|or wherever it was that we found you.
{131355}{131422}And let{y:i}'s see you get by|on an instructor{y:i}'s salary.
{131424}{131479}Now shape up or get out.
{131492}{131519}Is that clear?
{131521}{131597}Mr. Fox, there{y:i}'s been|a possible sighting in Las Vegas.
{131603}{131719}- They{y:i}'re probably headed in this direction.|- Let{y:i}'s set up a command post in Winslow.
{131773}{131811}You{y:i}'d better get out there...
{131828}{131898}...providing you still want to be|a member of the team.
{131914}{131942}You do, don{y:i}'t you?
{132005}{132053}- Yes, sir.|- All right, then get going.
{132085}{132137}Get rid of that damn cigar.
{132365}{132448}We ought to be coming to the crater|anytime now.
{132479}{132539}You{y:i}'re gonna make it.|You{y:i}'re gonna go home.
{132594}{132636}You want to, don{y:i}'t you?
{132642}{132680}Yes, of course.
{132904}{132949}What{y:i}'s it like up there?
{132972}{133012}It is beautiful.
{133039}{133083}Not like this, but it is beautiful.
{133115}{133197}There is only one language.|One law. One people.
{133200}{133248}And there is no war, no hunger...
{133251}{133320}...and the strong|do not victimise the helpless.
{133331}{133446}We are very civilised,|but we have lost something, I think.
{133492}{133560}You are all so much alive. All so different.
{133614}{133697}I will miss the cooks|and the singing and the dancing.
{133733}{133763}And the eating.
{134160}{134208}And the other things.
{134806}{134859}Morning, folks. What{y:i}'ll you have?
{134878}{134908}Coffee.
{134914}{134940}Dutch apple pie?
{134959}{135041}- How about some nice cherry cobbler?|- That{y:i}'ll be fine.
{135155}{135187}And whipped cream.
{135189}{135229}Coming right up.
{135237}{135289}How long does it take to get to the crater?
{135291}{135366}Driving? Not long. Five, six minutes is all.
{135386}{135447}I want you to try this cherry cobbler.
{135450}{135537}And if you don{y:i}'t like it,|you don{y:i}'t have to pay for it.
{135652}{135681}It{y:i}'s delicious.
{135683}{135723}My wife made it.
{135748}{135784}Is very good.
{136345}{136387}Do you have somebody?
{136429}{136461}A wife, like...
{136482}{136514}...up there?
{136542}{136568}No.
{136592}{136619}No?
{136671}{136709}I wish{y:i}...
{136738}{136775}I wish{y:i}...
{136806}{136834}What?
{136999}{137061}Morning, folks.|Is that your Cadillac outside?
{138482}{138526}All right, go ahead.
{138601}{138639}Yeah, hold it. Yeah, okay.
{138864}{138917}I{y:i}'d like to talk to these people alone.
{138921}{138986}I{y:i}'ll be right outside if you need me.
{139018}{139125}George Fox just called in on the radio,|said to say they{y:i}'re on their way over.
{139585}{139704}I{y:i}'m Mark Shermin, SETI,|the Search for Extraterrestrial{y:i}...
{139782}{139857}Mrs. Hayden, we talked on the phone.
{139883}{139927}This is just such a{y:i}...
{140000}{140032}Do you mind if I sit down?
{140146}{140248}There{y:i}'s so many questions I{y:i}'d like to ask,|I hardly even know where to begin.
{140278}{140324}Is there anything I can do for you?
{140335}{140370}You can let him go.
{140389}{140420}I can{y:i}'t.
{140442}{140500}Really, I can{y:i}'t. I{y:i}'m sorry.
{140520}{140545}Is it{y:i}...
{140551}{140606}Are you supposed to meet someone here?
{140608}{140633}Yes.
{140635}{140694}You don{y:i}'t understand,|there isn{y:i}'t much time.
{140696}{140749}Why here? Why the crater?
{140794}{140851}Have people from your world|been here before?
{140862}{140896}Before, yes.
{140913}{140985}We are interested in your species.
{141015}{141080}You mean you{y:i}'re some kind|of an anthropologist?
{141085}{141149}Is that what you{y:i}'re doing here?|Just checking us out?
{141152}{141198}You are a strange species...
{141222}{141250}...not like any other.
{141289}{141348}And you would be surprised|how many there are.
{141357}{141405}Intelligent but savage.
{141489}{141556}Shall I tell you|what I find beautiful about you?
{141658}{141736}You are at your very best|when things are worst.
{141776}{141824}Let him go, Mr. Shermin, please.
{141929}{141966}If he stays here...
{141990}{142015}...he{y:i}'ll die.
{142106}{142161}Can{y:i}'t you see he{y:i}'s dying now?
{142402}{142435}Thank you.
{142635}{142668}Thank you.
{143318}{143356}Wrong ones?
{143360}{143416}They sure as hell fit the description.
{143418}{143507}No. The guy we{y:i}'re looking for|is a lot older.
{144100}{144164}Where are they?|What have you done with them?
{144166}{144270}- Trooper, where are your prisoners?|- Wrong ones. We had to let them go.
{144272}{144304}You what?
{144612}{144663}Shermin, you are finished.
{144670}{144735}I will have you eviscerated for this.
{144745}{144823}Well, as much as I hate|to stoop to symbolism.
{146057}{146098}I hear something.
{146425}{146455}Give me your hand.
{148702}{148807}All units, this is Fox.|I want warning fire only.
{148817}{148851}When ready, roger that.
{148868}{148906}I copy. Here we go.
{150040}{150155}{y:i}Mrs. Hayden, you and your companion|{y:i}must stop immediately.

{152225}{152264}What the hell is that?
{155419}{155452}I must go.
{155512}{155553}Take me with you.
{155556}{155604}- I cannot.|- Please.
{155607}{155647}You will die there.
{155649}{155691}I don{y:i}'t think I care.
{155693}{155723}I care.
{155728}{155757}Now...
{155785}{155877}...tell me again how to say goodbye.
{155955}{155988}Kiss me...
{156046}{156098}...and tell me you love me.
{156139}{156173}I love you.
{156344}{156411}I{y:i}'m never going to see you again, am I?
{156459}{156485}No.
{156596}{156630}I love you.
{156888}{156936}Tell the baby about me.
{156995}{157025}I will.
{157462}{157514}What should I do with this?
