1
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:06,397
Ladies and gentlemen,
Christopher Wilde!

2
00:00:12,126 --> 00:00:13,400
Every girl, every boy

3
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:16,802
They got your posters on their walls

4
00:00:17,406 --> 00:00:20,125
Photographs, autographs
Soon as you step out the door

5
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:21,758
You will meet the applause

6
00:00:21,806 --> 00:00:22,841
Yeah!

7
00:00:22,886 --> 00:00:28,040
Paparazzis hiding in the bushes
Trying to make a dollar

8
00:00:28,086 --> 00:00:30,122
Wanna be you, when they see you

9
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,839
They scream out loud

10
00:00:33,126 --> 00:00:37,961
Starstruck, camera flashes
Cover of magazines

11
00:00:38,446 --> 00:00:42,678
Starstruck, designer sunglasses
Living the dream as a teen

12
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:45,798
Driving fancy cars
Hollywood Boulevard

13
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:48,963
Hear the crowd
calling your name, yeah!

14
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:50,564
Starstruck!

15
00:00:50,606 --> 00:00:51,641
Prepare to get...

16
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:53,199
Starstruck!

17
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:54,885
All right!

18
00:00:56,246 --> 00:00:57,474
Yeah!

19
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:00,045
Starstruck

20
00:01:01,606 --> 00:01:04,962
Yeah! Yay-yeah!

21
00:01:05,406 --> 00:01:06,521
As soon as you move

22
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,840
They gonna talk about it

23
00:01:07,886 --> 00:01:09,239
In the paper, the news

24
00:01:09,286 --> 00:01:10,719
They gonna talk about it

25
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:11,915
'Cause you're on the A-list

26
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:16,596
You better believe it
You better believe it, yeah...

27
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:20,201
I just love Christopher Wilde.

28
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:22,725
'Cause you're in the top spot

29
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:24,677
And nothing can stop ya
And nothing can stop ya

30
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:25,960
Jessica!

31
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:28,638
Oh, I'm sorry, Sara.

32
00:01:28,686 --> 00:01:30,722
Am I blocking your view
of what's his name?

33
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:33,041
Move it or lose it, sister.

34
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:36,476
Sara, Jessica. Suitcases.

35
00:01:36,526 --> 00:01:38,118
Come pick out your clothes
and get packed.

36
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:41,397
We're leaving for the airport
right after school tomorrow.

37
00:01:43,246 --> 00:01:44,474
In less than 2 4 hours,

38
00:01:44,526 --> 00:01:47,518
I'll be in Los Angeles
where Christopher lives.

39
00:01:48,326 --> 00:01:50,282
What if he picks me up at the airport?

40
00:01:50,326 --> 00:01:52,078
Why would he do that?

41
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,557
I'm an original member of his fan club.

42
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:56,597
I follow his minute-by-minute
blog posts,

43
00:01:56,646 --> 00:01:58,841
and I text him every day.

44
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:01,116
Trust me, he wants to meet me.

45
00:02:02,526 --> 00:02:04,642
ls it too late for me to be an only child?

46
00:02:04,686 --> 00:02:06,995
-Yes.
-Then can I please stay home?

47
00:02:07,046 --> 00:02:08,479
-No.
-Why not?

48
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:10,642
Because your grandmother
hasn't seen you in two years.

49
00:02:10,686 --> 00:02:12,324
Plus, you're a minor and it's illegal.

50
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,880
Everybody...
There's more about Christopher.

51
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,678
The fabulous Christopher Wilde

52
00:02:16,726 --> 00:02:19,604
picked up six
Music Association Awards last night,

53
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:21,921
just in time for his new CD,
Real Wilde,

54
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:24,400
to drop, wow, double platinum.

55
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:27,285
I caught up with our favourite pop star
on the red carpet.

56
00:02:27,326 --> 00:02:28,805
Well, first I'd love to say

57
00:02:28,846 --> 00:02:30,245
thank you so much
for buying the records

58
00:02:30,286 --> 00:02:31,878
and coming to my concerts.

59
00:02:31,926 --> 00:02:33,962
You're the reason I love what I do.

60
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:35,917
You guys are the best fans
in the world. Thank you.

61
00:02:37,046 --> 00:02:39,514
He is such an amazing person.

62
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:42,042
He's definitely not amazing.

63
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:43,804
He is amazing.

64
00:02:43,846 --> 00:02:47,043
And if you knew him like I know him,
you wouldn't say that.

65
00:02:47,086 --> 00:02:51,045
Hello? We live in Michigan.
You don't know him.

66
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:53,165
But I do.

67
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:55,676
I know everything about him.

68
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:59,521
I know where he works,

69
00:03:01,606 --> 00:03:02,834
eats,

70
00:03:04,206 --> 00:03:05,241
shops,

71
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:07,601
surfs,

72
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:10,875
and parties.

73
00:03:13,966 --> 00:03:15,638
-You ready to party?
-Absolutely.

74
00:03:15,686 --> 00:03:16,801
Well, let's do it!

75
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:19,406
You know, out of all of your cars,
Angelina's my favourite.

76
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:21,960
-Angelina?
-Yeah. I mean, look at her.

77
00:03:22,006 --> 00:03:24,440
Hey, does that new valet
look a little shifty to you?

78
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:28,646
-No. Not really.
-He looks a little shifty to me.

79
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:30,517
Come on, Stubby.
Let's find you a real girl.

80
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:32,477
That is a real girl.

81
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:34,881
Oh, wow. Look who it is.

82
00:03:34,926 --> 00:03:36,803
Christopher Wilde's girlfriend,

83
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:39,838
the fantabulous,
fabulous Alexis Bender!

84
00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:41,764
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hi.

85
00:03:42,126 --> 00:03:43,684
-Stubby.
-Yeah.

86
00:03:44,286 --> 00:03:45,560
You look beautiful tonight.

87
00:03:45,606 --> 00:03:49,235
I know. Wait until you see
what I'm wearing tomorrow.

88
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:51,038
-Tomorrow?
-Tomorrow?

89
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,365
My birthday?

90
00:03:54,206 --> 00:03:56,845
Baby, you promised
you were gonna sing.

91
00:03:57,126 --> 00:03:59,924
Right. Hey, I'll be there. Absolutely.

92
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:02,004
Okay. Wait.

93
00:04:04,206 --> 00:04:06,845
-Something's wrong.
-Yeah, you're here.

94
00:04:07,486 --> 00:04:09,556
What? lt's guys' night out!

95
00:04:09,846 --> 00:04:11,837
Where are the paparazzi?

96
00:04:12,206 --> 00:04:14,720
Oh, you did not blog again, did you?

97
00:04:20,806 --> 00:04:22,000
There he is. Let's run.

98
00:04:22,046 --> 00:04:25,959
That's so weird. Hi.

99
00:04:26,606 --> 00:04:28,915
-Look right here.
-Just like that.

100
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:32,114
All right, back-back up, guys. Back...
Back up! Back up!

101
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,918
Okay, back up, back up,
back up, back up, back up!

102
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:35,843
-Come on.
-What? Calm down.

103
00:04:38,926 --> 00:04:40,644
You're not invited.

104
00:04:40,686 --> 00:04:43,837
Everybody's invited, Sara.
lt's an all-school dance.

105
00:04:43,886 --> 00:04:46,241
The operative word being ''dance.''

106
00:04:46,726 --> 00:04:48,478
Embarrassing.

107
00:04:48,526 --> 00:04:51,836
Don't worry. I'm just going there
to cover it for the school paper.

108
00:04:52,886 --> 00:04:55,036
Are you bringing your camera
with you to California?

109
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,804
AJ, of course I am.

110
00:04:56,846 --> 00:05:00,475
Because we still need pics
of Christopher Wilde!

111
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:05,361
Talking, walking, singing, dancing,
moving, breathing.

112
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:08,045
Why are you both
so hung up on this guy?

113
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:09,605
''This guy''?

114
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:13,245
-Now you see what I live with?
-Poor you.

115
00:05:13,286 --> 00:05:15,641
Little sister, when we go to California,

116
00:05:15,686 --> 00:05:17,517
you can play shuffleboard
with Grandma,

117
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:20,478
but I'm going to meet
Christopher Wilde.

118
00:05:20,526 --> 00:05:22,881
And just how
are you planning to do that?

119
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:25,759
Well, we've mapped out
his every move for the past 1 8 months.

120
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:29,685
I know when and where he's likely to be
every second of every day.

121
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:31,603
About the time we leave
for Los Angeles,

122
00:05:31,646 --> 00:05:34,877
he'll be having his daily meeting
with his managers.

123
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:43,197
-He's late.
-He'll be here.

124
00:05:43,246 --> 00:05:44,599
You need to manage him better.

125
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:46,238
Hello, we both manage him.

126
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:49,198
He needs to know opportunities
like this don't come every day.

127
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:50,884
He knows. He's not a kid.

128
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:52,484
Yo. What's up?

129
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:55,362
-You're late.
-Sorry, Mom.

130
00:05:56,926 --> 00:05:58,484
How you doing, Son?

131
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:00,039
Great, great. Excited.

132
00:06:00,086 --> 00:06:02,919
Oh, honey, honey, honey.
You could have cleaned up a little bit.

133
00:06:02,966 --> 00:06:05,480
What? I'm... I'm totally clean.

134
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,524
He looks like a street kid,
not a movie star.

135
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:09,875
He looks fine.
Just be yourself, Christopher.

136
00:06:09,926 --> 00:06:11,359
All right.

137
00:06:11,886 --> 00:06:13,205
He's here.

138
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:15,804
All right. This is it, bud.

139
00:06:15,846 --> 00:06:18,440
Your chance
at what we've always wanted.

140
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,044
-Alan, please come in.
-Sherry. Daniel!

141
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:29,438
-Great place you got here.
-Actually it's Christopher's.

142
00:06:29,486 --> 00:06:30,635
We just kind of work here.

143
00:06:30,686 --> 00:06:32,597
-All right. Christopher Wilde.
-Hey, Mr Smith.

144
00:06:32,646 --> 00:06:35,399
-My daughters are big fans of yours.
-Oh, great.

145
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:38,034
-Wow! This is great.
-Please.

146
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:41,594
I love this. I love this.

147
00:06:42,126 --> 00:06:44,686
Rock and roll! Hello, Cleveland!

148
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:48,921
Awesome. Got this album at the house.

149
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:50,365
Girls love this.

150
00:06:50,406 --> 00:06:51,839
Something Wilde.

151
00:06:51,886 --> 00:06:54,002
All right, now let's get right to the point.

152
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,320
Let's get right to it.

153
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:58,756
l've been watching you
and I like what I see.

154
00:06:58,806 --> 00:07:02,242
You are a talented, talented kid.
He's a talented kid.

155
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:05,039
You sing, you dance.
I hope you can act.

156
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:08,041
Because I like you for this movie.

157
00:07:09,086 --> 00:07:10,360
Thank you, sir.
I mean, coming from you,

158
00:07:10,406 --> 00:07:12,362
this would be such an honour to...
I mean, to work with someone...

159
00:07:12,406 --> 00:07:14,636
But my people don't necessarily
agree with me.

160
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:19,237
See, all they see is a spoiled punk
who likes to tangle with the paparazzi.

161
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,120
Alan, you know how the tabloids are.
They manipulate those photos to...

162
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,282
Daniel, I get it. I get it.

163
00:07:25,806 --> 00:07:27,524
Look, all I'm saying, kid,

164
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:30,399
is a chance like this
comes along once in a lifetime,

165
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:31,481
and I want to give you a shot,

166
00:07:31,526 --> 00:07:35,235
but you have to prove that
you're a serious and committed actor.

167
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:36,321
How do I do that?

168
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:37,765
On Monday,
I'm gonna meet with my people,

169
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:39,159
try and sell them on you.

170
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:41,276
In the meantime,
you keep your face out of the tabloids.

171
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:43,715
No press, good or bad. Okay?

172
00:07:44,526 --> 00:07:46,960
-l can do that.
-In fact, stay home.

173
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,202
-All right.
-Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.

174
00:07:58,286 --> 00:08:00,754
You're such a dork.
You brought homework?

175
00:08:00,806 --> 00:08:03,843
No. lt's called reading.
You should try it sometime.

176
00:08:03,886 --> 00:08:05,444
What? I read.

177
00:08:07,326 --> 00:08:09,282
This? lt's all pictures.

178
00:08:09,726 --> 00:08:11,318
Don't touch that!

179
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:12,600
Gladly.

180
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:15,204
What's taking them so long?

181
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:18,841
Just get me a car already
so I can go meet Christopher Wilde.

182
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:21,960
Sara. You can't drive.

183
00:08:22,206 --> 00:08:24,162
Yes, I can. Licence.

184
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:26,437
No, you can't. Sign.

185
00:08:28,526 --> 00:08:30,994
''You must be at least
25-years-old to drive

186
00:08:31,046 --> 00:08:33,924
''or rent a car from
Los Angeles Car Rental''?

187
00:08:34,526 --> 00:08:35,720
What?

188
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:39,515
How am I supposed to do
what I wanna do?

189
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:41,397
And what would that be?

190
00:08:42,526 --> 00:08:46,121
Take Jessica sightseeing.

191
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:49,517
Well, I think your grandma's
got a car you can borrow.

192
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:50,601
Sweet.

193
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:54,034
See what I mean? Mom, be careful!

194
00:08:54,086 --> 00:08:55,678
Here comes the cavalry.

195
00:08:55,726 --> 00:08:56,954
You could fall and break a hip.

196
00:08:57,006 --> 00:09:01,363
Oh, now, Barbara. Calm down.
Howard had my back. Hi.

197
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:03,442
We take care of each other.

198
00:09:05,326 --> 00:09:06,725
Okay then.

199
00:09:09,646 --> 00:09:11,079
-Grandma!
-Jessica!

200
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:12,844
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

201
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,525
-l've missed you so much.
-Ditto.

202
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:18,558
Sara. You can take her
for a spin if you want to.

203
00:09:18,606 --> 00:09:21,518
Just gave her a tune-up.
She runs like a top.

204
00:09:21,886 --> 00:09:25,879
Yeah, a super-ugly top
you'd never want to be seen in.

205
00:09:27,246 --> 00:09:30,522
Does that mean
you'll be joining us for shuffleboard?

206
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:36,644
Sara out!

207
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:42,403
Grandma says stop pacing.
You're creating a draught.

208
00:09:42,446 --> 00:09:43,674
I just got a call from AJ.

209
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:45,125
She just had a chat about a text

210
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,758
quoting a blog
about Christopher Wilde.

211
00:09:46,806 --> 00:09:49,604
He's singing tonight
at Alexis Bender's birthday party.

212
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,045
I have to go!

213
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:53,805
Good luck
convincing Mom and Dad of that.

214
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,036
-Go with me.
-No.

215
00:09:58,006 --> 00:09:59,200
They'll let me go if you go, too.

216
00:09:59,246 --> 00:10:01,123
How many times do I have to say this?

217
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,839
I'm not interested in meeting
a stupid celebrity.

218
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:06,081
I mean, I am sick and tired
of Christopher Wilde.

219
00:10:06,126 --> 00:10:08,765
-He's all you talk about.
-I'll shut up.

220
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:10,319
-What?
-lf you go with me,

221
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:14,120
and I meet Christopher Wilde,
I'll stop talking about him

222
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,679
for the rest of the trip.

223
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:17,717
How about the rest of your life?

224
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:18,960
Please?

225
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,074
Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

226
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:30,436
What are you doing?
This is a no-parking zone.

227
00:10:30,486 --> 00:10:34,445
When one person stays in the car,
it's not parking. lt's waiting.

228
00:10:34,486 --> 00:10:36,283
We'll get a ticket.

229
00:10:37,726 --> 00:10:40,320
Just get behind the wheel!

230
00:10:40,446 --> 00:10:41,925
-Do it!
-Okay!

231
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:45,085
Every boy, every girl

232
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:48,721
They got your posters
on their wall, yeah!

233
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:57,916
I don't know about this, man.

234
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,641
-Nah, it'll be fine.
-We shouldn't even be here.

235
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:02,165
I mean, we should be at home,

236
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:04,401
chilling at that party
your parents are throwing.

237
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:07,404
Since when do you want
to party with my parents?

238
00:11:07,446 --> 00:11:10,518
Are you kidding?
The caterer's from Argentina.

239
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:13,080
There's gonna be steak for dessert.

240
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:16,637
Tempting, but I promised Alexis
l'd sing at her birthday.

241
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:20,474
-I'm not going to let her down.
-You and your stupid friendship rules!

242
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:22,517
Yeah, they work for you, don't they?

243
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:25,126
Stay at my house for free,
eat my food, drive my cars...

244
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,077
Okay, okay.

245
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:31,922
And in return, you get to hang out
with myself, Albert J. Stubbins.

246
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:33,843
Best friend since fourth grade.

247
00:11:33,886 --> 00:11:36,320
Yeah. Works for me, too, Stubs.

248
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:38,281
Let's do this.

249
00:11:41,646 --> 00:11:42,999
He's here.

250
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:50,119
Just stay here.

251
00:12:02,046 --> 00:12:05,322
Alexis! Baby! Happy Birthday.

252
00:12:07,966 --> 00:12:10,639
-Where's Christopher?
-He couldn't make it.

253
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:13,758
-He's at home eating steak.
-Alexis, where's your boyfriend?

254
00:12:13,806 --> 00:12:14,955
Come on. Let's go have some fun.

255
00:12:15,006 --> 00:12:16,234
-Stubby!
-What?

256
00:12:16,286 --> 00:12:18,561
I'm so sorry I'm late! Come on!

257
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:22,202
-Do you know her?
-Not yet.

258
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:26,080
Great. I'm gonna be here forever.

259
00:12:37,246 --> 00:12:38,474
Thanks.

260
00:12:42,606 --> 00:12:44,437
Looks like we pulled it off.

261
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:45,641
What would you do without me?

262
00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:47,836
Our birthday girl in the VIP section,

263
00:12:47,886 --> 00:12:50,764
Alexis Bender,
has a special guest tonight.

264
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:53,442
Christopher Wilde.

265
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:56,479
I knew it.

266
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:03,404
Excuse me.

267
00:13:04,846 --> 00:13:08,282
No, you can't see me

Little mama, how ya like me now?

00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:42,481
On the dance floor we can work it out

00:13:42,526 --> 00:13:44,801
And bring this whole place down

282
00:13:44,846 --> 00:13:46,404

317
00:16:12,886 --> 00:16:14,683
No, the door hit me by itself.

318
00:16:14,726 --> 00:16:16,637
-This is not good.
-For you or for me?

319
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:18,244
'Cause right now
it feels a lot worse for me.

320
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:20,595
-This is really not good.
-Wait.

321
00:16:22,206 --> 00:16:23,321
You're Chris...

322
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:24,640
I will give you front-row tickets
to my next concert

323
00:16:24,686 --> 00:16:27,837
-if you don't scream my name.
-l don't want to see your stupid concert.

324
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:31,200
Okay. I need to get you to a doctor.

325
00:16:31,486 --> 00:16:33,044
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

326
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:35,839
No, get this hand. This hand.
There we go. Come on. Just...

327
00:16:35,886 --> 00:16:38,400
-What about Sara?
-Who's Sara?

328
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:40,835
My sister. She's up in the club.

329
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:44,201
-What happened?
-Look, help now. Questions later.

330
00:16:44,246 --> 00:16:46,714
-Okay.
-Just get her in the car.

331
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:54,717
-Who is this?
-Seat belt.

332
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:56,882
-What is your name?
-Jessica.

333
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,234
Well, it's nice to meet you, Jessica.

334
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,277
I can think of nicer ways.

335
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,154
I'm not feeling too hot.

336
00:17:08,206 --> 00:17:10,197
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Do not hurl in Britney, okay?

337
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:12,202
-l just got her detailed.
-Okay.

338
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:15,522
Oh, no, those are my favourite shoes!

339
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,402
I'll buy you new ones. Door.

340
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:22,321
Keys. Just make sure
her sister Sara gets home okay.

341
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:24,926
Just don't tell anyone about this.

342
00:17:24,966 --> 00:17:27,526
I got to get some new shoes!

343
00:17:31,646 --> 00:17:34,206
Follow the light with your eyes.

344
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:40,200
Well, l've done a thorough exam,
and the CT scan was normal.

345
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,444
Everything looks good.

346
00:17:42,486 --> 00:17:44,158
-So she's okay?
-Out.

347
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:46,635
There's no sign of head trauma,

348
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:49,120
and I'm absolutely certain
you don't have a concussion.

349
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,485
How come I threw up?

350
00:17:50,526 --> 00:17:52,005
Maybe it was something you ate.

351
00:17:52,046 --> 00:17:55,197
Or maybe it was a reaction
to meeting that doofus.

352
00:17:56,406 --> 00:17:58,078
lt's a curtain, Sanjay. I can hear you.

353
00:17:58,126 --> 00:17:59,718
No, no, you can't.

354
00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:03,515
-You two know each other?
-Yeah. He's my sister's husband.

355
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,400
So I can go now?

356
00:18:05,446 --> 00:18:08,483
Yes, but I want you to put an ice pack
on that bump until you get home.

357
00:18:08,526 --> 00:18:10,642
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

358
00:18:15,686 --> 00:18:18,439
-You gonna answer that?
-Oh, right. Just...

359
00:18:23,006 --> 00:18:24,758
Hello, Mom? What?

360
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:26,961
Who?

361
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:28,560
Where?

362
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:29,675
Now?

363
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:31,523
Yes! Right now!

364
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:32,601
We thought he wasn't coming,

365
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:34,921
but he just showed up
with your two biggest fans.

366
00:18:34,966 --> 00:18:37,719
Look, you promised him you were
gonna stay home this weekend.

367
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:39,358
lt's up to you to fix this, Christopher.

368
00:18:39,406 --> 00:18:41,237
Okay. Just stall them.
I will be right there.

369
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,878
-Sherry!
-Alan!

370
00:18:42,926 --> 00:18:44,075
Where is he?

371
00:18:44,446 --> 00:18:46,004
-That might be a problem.
-Why?

372
00:18:46,046 --> 00:18:48,560
My waiting room is filled with big guys
with big cameras.

373
00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:50,801
You... The paparazzi found me?

374
00:18:51,846 --> 00:18:54,076
Okay, Sanjay,
what kind of car you driving?

375
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:55,161
Nothing you'd be interested in.

376
00:18:55,206 --> 00:18:57,242
I'm still paying off six years
of medical school.

377
00:18:57,286 --> 00:18:59,595
-Perfect. How about a trade?
-No.

378
00:19:00,046 --> 00:19:01,525
Only happens once.

379
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:02,760
Okay.

380
00:19:16,726 --> 00:19:17,920
Are you sure this is safe?

381
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:19,365
I'm pretty sure.

382
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:21,476
-I'm pretty sure it's not!
-Just calm down, okay?

383
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:25,155
I don't wanna calm down!
I wanna go home! Okay?

384
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,242
-What is wrong with you?
-What's wrong with me?

385
00:19:27,286 --> 00:19:30,084
Nothing. Nothing. I'm looking forward
to being grounded until I'm 30!

386
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:31,161
Oh, is that why you're so crabby?

387
00:19:31,206 --> 00:19:32,958
-I'm not crabby!
-Not crabby. Defensive.

388
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,883
-l am not defensive.
-See?

389
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:36,644
You disagree with everything I say.

390
00:19:36,686 --> 00:19:37,755
-Do not!
-Do, too!

391
00:19:37,806 --> 00:19:40,081
-Just take me home!
-l will!

392
00:19:40,526 --> 00:19:43,643
First we need to make one
teeny-tiny little stop.

393
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:48,402
You've got to be kidding.

394
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:51,516
-You live here?
-Yeah, why?

395
00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:54,325
-Go, go. Let's go.
-What are you doing?

396
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:55,719
Got to go upstairs. Got to go.

397
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:57,597
-Stop pulling me!
-I'm sorry. I just...

398
00:19:57,646 --> 00:19:59,762
Where are we going? Christopher!

399
00:19:59,806 --> 00:20:02,001
-I'm sorry. I just don't know...
-Don't know where to hide me?

400
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:03,320
No, I'm not hiding you.

401
00:20:03,366 --> 00:20:06,836
lt's just that I don't want these
particular people to see you right now.

402
00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:08,205
And because I'm not a movie star.

403
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:11,363
No! Okay, because I don't want anyone
asking questions and neither do you.

404
00:20:11,406 --> 00:20:12,964
Who is she? Where did you meet her?
Are you two dating?

405
00:20:13,006 --> 00:20:16,635
-Dating?
-Yeah, they make stuff up. Come on.

406
00:20:21,006 --> 00:20:22,598
The guestroom. Be my guest.

407
00:20:22,646 --> 00:20:25,001
-Do I have a choice?
-Not really. I'll be right back.

408
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:26,445
Just stay.

409
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,841
Woof.

410
00:20:32,046 --> 00:20:33,764
Good to see you.

411
00:20:33,846 --> 00:20:36,155
I'm glad you came. Thanks for coming.

412
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:39,198
Hey! Hey, how are you?
So nice to see you.

413
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:41,563
Looking good, buddy.

414
00:20:43,406 --> 00:20:45,397
-Hey. lt's about time.
-Hey, Mom.

415
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:47,038
-How you doing, bud?
-Good to see you.

416
00:20:47,086 --> 00:20:48,644
-Christopher, my daughters.
-Oh, yeah. What's up?

417
00:20:48,686 --> 00:20:50,005
I think they wanted to
ask you something.

418
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:51,195
-Yeah.
-Can you sing us a song?

419
00:20:51,246 --> 00:20:52,964
Of course, absolutely.
l've got something new I'm working on.

420
00:20:53,006 --> 00:20:54,041
-Can you grab me a stool?
-Sure, Chris.

421
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,804
-You know where your guitar is?
-Yeah. Of course.

422
00:20:55,846 --> 00:20:57,677
You're gonna love this.

423
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:06,079
Hey, everybody.

424
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:08,640
This is a little something
I'm working on for my next album.

425
00:21:08,686 --> 00:21:10,438
I hope you like it.

426
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:30,476
I'm no superman
I can't take your hand

427
00:21:30,526 --> 00:21:35,441
And fly you anywhere
you wanna go, yeah

428
00:21:35,966 --> 00:21:41,040
I can't read your mind
Like a billboard sign

429
00:21:41,086 --> 00:21:44,965
And tell you everything
you want to hear

430
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:50,444
But I'll be your hero

431
00:21:50,846 --> 00:21:55,681
'Cause I, I can be everything you need

432
00:21:55,726 --> 00:21:57,398
If you're the one for me

433
00:21:57,446 --> 00:22:01,519
Like gravity, I'll be unstoppable

434
00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:05,923
I, yeah, I believe in destiny

435
00:22:05,966 --> 00:22:11,359
I may be an ordinary guy
with heart and soul

436
00:22:11,726 --> 00:22:15,605
But if you're the one for me

437
00:22:15,646 --> 00:22:18,240
Then I'll be your hero

438
00:22:19,486 --> 00:22:25,880
Oh, I'll be your hero, yeah

439
00:22:26,206 --> 00:22:28,436
I'll be your hero

440
00:22:28,486 --> 00:22:30,636
So incredible

441
00:22:30,926 --> 00:22:33,394
Some kind of miracle

442
00:22:33,446 --> 00:22:35,357
That when it's meant to be

443
00:22:35,406 --> 00:22:39,638
I'll become a hero, oh

444
00:22:39,686 --> 00:22:44,806
So I'll wait, wait, wait, wait for you

445
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:52,320
Yeah, I'll be a hero, yeah

446
00:22:53,726 --> 00:22:58,356
'Cause I, I can be everything you need

447
00:22:58,406 --> 00:23:00,124
If you're the one for me

448
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:04,318
Like gravity, I'll be unstoppable

449
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:08,757
I, yeah, I believe in destiny

450
00:23:08,806 --> 00:23:14,324
I may be an ordinary guy
with heart and soul

451
00:23:14,366 --> 00:23:18,564
But if you're the one for me

452
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,961
I'll be your hero

453
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:26,723
Yeah, yeah, I'll be your hero

454
00:23:27,686 --> 00:23:32,680
Yeah, I'll be your hero

455
00:23:33,126 --> 00:23:34,844
Hero

456
00:23:42,966 --> 00:23:44,638
Great. Great.

457
00:23:44,686 --> 00:23:47,359
So, girls, am I the greatest Dad
in the world or what?

458
00:24:02,846 --> 00:24:04,757
Hey! Where you going?

459
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,918
Anywhere but here.

460
00:24:06,966 --> 00:24:08,160
What did I do now?

461
00:24:08,206 --> 00:24:10,720
You said you'd take me home. When?

462
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:12,760
Just pick a car. I'll take you home.

463
00:24:12,806 --> 00:24:15,115
-No!
-Fine, we'll walk.

464
00:24:15,846 --> 00:24:18,121
-Where does Grandma live again?
-Hollywood.

465
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:21,158
Oh, that's great.
We'll get there on Tuesday.

466
00:24:23,326 --> 00:24:24,918
-Okay.
-Okay?

467
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:26,565
But here are the rules.

468
00:24:26,606 --> 00:24:28,483
You drive me straight there,
drop me off,

469
00:24:28,526 --> 00:24:31,359
and then you come back
to your fabulous life.

470
00:24:39,606 --> 00:24:42,564
What's the purpose of that?
I don't get it.

471
00:24:43,486 --> 00:24:45,078
Why does she do this?

472
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:18,242
There's something about
the sunshine, baby

473
00:25:18,286 --> 00:25:21,642
I'm seeing you in a whole new light

474
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,880
Really?

475
00:25:24,486 --> 00:25:26,681
What? I thought you'd like it.

476
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:28,195
Let me guess.

477
00:25:28,246 --> 00:25:30,555
You thought l'd be dying to ride
in a car with Christopher Wilde

478
00:25:30,606 --> 00:25:32,881
as he sings to one of his big hits.

479
00:25:32,926 --> 00:25:36,714
A fan's dream come true!
There's just one problem.

480
00:25:36,766 --> 00:25:38,916
-Which is?
-I'm not your fan.

481
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:44,200
You don't... You don't like my music?

482
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:47,797
No, I like your music.
I'm just not crazy about you.

483
00:25:48,926 --> 00:25:51,565
-But you don't even know me.
-Precisely.

484
00:25:55,206 --> 00:25:57,162
You know, I think if you...
I think if you did know me,

485
00:25:57,206 --> 00:25:59,766
-you'd really like me.
-Turn here.

486
00:26:26,006 --> 00:26:28,884
-Thanks for the ride.
-Hey, look, Jessica.

487
00:26:30,086 --> 00:26:31,758
Look, I just wanna say I'm sorry.

488
00:26:31,806 --> 00:26:33,637
Noted. Are we done now?

489
00:26:34,286 --> 00:26:37,483
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I guess we're done.
-Good.

490
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:39,565
Okay, bye.

491
00:26:51,286 --> 00:26:53,083
Oh, great.

492
00:27:13,606 --> 00:27:14,641
Go away.

493
00:27:14,686 --> 00:27:16,916
Look, I'll give you $5,000
if you do me this favour.

494
00:27:16,966 --> 00:27:19,116
lt's not a favour if you pay for it.

495
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,758
So is that a yes?

496
00:27:25,526 --> 00:27:27,084
You know, you can help a little.

497
00:27:27,126 --> 00:27:30,323
No, this car wouldn't be moving
if I wasn't pushing it.

498
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:32,482
You'll be out of here before morning,
right?

499
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,994
Yes. Hopefully no one will ever know
I was here.

500
00:27:35,046 --> 00:27:36,365
I'll know.

501
00:27:36,646 --> 00:27:39,399
-Thank you. Thanks a lot.
-Yeah.

502
00:27:42,206 --> 00:27:44,003
Hey, is there anything up there
that I can wear

503
00:27:44,046 --> 00:27:46,162
so when I do leave,
the paparazzi won't recognise me?

504
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,197
You can look in those.

505
00:27:49,606 --> 00:27:51,881
So, is all this really necessary?

506
00:27:51,926 --> 00:27:55,839
Yes. Clearly you don't understand.
They're everywhere.

507
00:27:56,486 --> 00:27:57,714
Paranoid.

508
00:27:58,006 --> 00:27:59,564
You know what? Just forget it.

509
00:27:59,606 --> 00:28:00,959
Love to.

510
00:28:02,406 --> 00:28:03,555
Well?

511
00:28:05,566 --> 00:28:07,397
That was my grandpa's hat.

512
00:28:07,446 --> 00:28:09,243
He used to wear it
when he took me fishing.

513
00:28:09,286 --> 00:28:11,242
Oh, wow. I'm sorry. Here.

514
00:28:11,286 --> 00:28:14,244
No. You keep it.
lt looks kind of good on you.

515
00:28:14,566 --> 00:28:15,715
Thanks.

516
00:28:16,286 --> 00:28:17,435
Anything else?

517
00:28:17,486 --> 00:28:19,636
No. No, I'm cool.

518
00:28:19,686 --> 00:28:22,439
Yeah.
So cool you're sleeping in your car.

519
00:28:22,726 --> 00:28:24,045
Jessica.

520
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:27,563
-Stop doing that!
-What am I doing?

521
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:29,642
Oh, you know exactly
what you're doing.

522
00:28:29,686 --> 00:28:31,517
In fact, I bet you do it all the time.

523
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:35,878
You give girls that look
and expect them to fall for you.

524
00:28:35,926 --> 00:28:38,884
Well, it's not working with me,
so get over it!

525
00:28:48,366 --> 00:28:51,995
Eat up. We're helping Grandma
with some yard work today.

526
00:28:52,046 --> 00:28:54,196
-Morning, sunshine.
-Hey.

527
00:28:56,766 --> 00:28:58,245
-Syrup, please.
-l didn't see any.

528
00:28:58,286 --> 00:29:01,596
-Mom, got any more syrup?
-Oh, sure. On the shelf in the garage.

529
00:29:01,646 --> 00:29:03,079
I'll get it.

530
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:07,038
No. I'll get it.

531
00:29:09,126 --> 00:29:12,357
-How was your little cab ride?
-What cab ride?

532
00:29:12,406 --> 00:29:15,557
What cab ride? I am this close
to meeting Christopher Wilde,

533
00:29:15,606 --> 00:29:17,358
and I have to leave because Stubby

534
00:29:17,406 --> 00:29:19,362
tells me that you decided
to take a cab home.

535
00:29:19,406 --> 00:29:20,839
Oh, that cab.

536
00:29:21,606 --> 00:29:25,758
Where did you go? Wait. Don't tell me.
I don't wanna be that bored.

537
00:29:25,966 --> 00:29:28,526
I'll make it up to you.
I'll help you find him.

538
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,875
How are you going to do that?

539
00:29:32,326 --> 00:29:36,160
Let's go... Let's go inside and research.

540
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,124
Mom and Dad don't even need to know.

541
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:39,884
Mom and Dad
don't need to know what?

542
00:29:39,926 --> 00:29:41,723
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

543
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:51,082
I don't understand you girls.

544
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,798
-Oh, that's wonderful.
-Yeah, great.

545
00:29:58,766 --> 00:30:00,916
Oh, Sara.
They're doing a story on television

546
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,558
about that boy you like so much.
In there.

547
00:30:02,606 --> 00:30:03,880
Yeah.

548
00:30:06,366 --> 00:30:07,958
-No!
-What is with you?

549
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,758
I don't...

550
00:30:10,846 --> 00:30:13,519
Alexis Bender arrived
at her birthday party last night

551
00:30:13,566 --> 00:30:15,522
without her leading man.

552
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:19,081
Although no one saw him arrive
at the fabulous Club Under 2 1,

553
00:30:19,126 --> 00:30:22,004
witnesses confirm that
Christopher Wilde did indeed

554
00:30:22,046 --> 00:30:25,880
make a secret appearance to sing
for the packed house of well-wishers.

555
00:30:25,926 --> 00:30:28,121
Partygoers say the pop star
left the club immediately

556
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,440
following his performance,

557
00:30:29,486 --> 00:30:32,205
only to magically reappear
at his Beverly Hills mansion

558
00:30:32,246 --> 00:30:34,999
several hours later with a different girl.

559
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,004
My sources tell me this mystery girl

560
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:39,401
might be stealing the heart
of our favourite pop star.

561
00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:40,959
Stop! I wanna see that!

562
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,281
Why? lt's all lies. Technically, slander.

563
00:30:43,326 --> 00:30:45,476
Why do you care?
You don't even like him.

564
00:30:45,526 --> 00:30:48,199
I care about the truth.
And I'm pretty sure that's not it.

565
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,282
-Girls, knock it off.
-l know what.

566
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:53,159
lt's a beautiful day. Here.

567
00:30:53,206 --> 00:30:55,083
Take the keys to my car,
and go to the beach.

568
00:30:55,126 --> 00:30:57,003
Really? Thanks, Grandma.

569
00:30:59,486 --> 00:31:01,397
Take Jessica with you.

570
00:31:02,966 --> 00:31:04,001
Go.

571
00:31:30,846 --> 00:31:33,918
I thought we were going to Venice.
Why are we in Malibu?

572
00:31:33,966 --> 00:31:36,844
Because Christopher Wilde
surfs in Malibu.

573
00:31:39,206 --> 00:31:42,721
Today's the day. I can feel it.
He's here somewhere.

574
00:31:43,086 --> 00:31:44,201
I doubt that.

575
00:31:44,246 --> 00:31:46,157
I just hope
he's not with Alexis Bender, who,

576
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:49,164
lMHO, is totally not cute enough
for him.

577
00:31:51,206 --> 00:31:54,437
I wonder what his eyes look like.
Up close.

578
00:31:55,366 --> 00:31:57,880
Blue. Really blue.

579
00:32:07,846 --> 00:32:10,280
Excuse me. ls this seat taken?

580
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:14,277
No? Okay.

581
00:32:17,086 --> 00:32:20,078
What a beautiful day.
lsn't it a beautiful day?

582
00:32:23,126 --> 00:32:26,357
Oh, I'm sorry. You were sleeping.
Did I wake you?

583
00:32:27,766 --> 00:32:30,121
No? Oh, then you're awake. Good.

584
00:32:32,006 --> 00:32:34,645
Would you put some
sunscreen on my back?

585
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:41,045
-How did you know it was me?
-The hat.

586
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,405
Does kind of smell like fish.

587
00:32:43,446 --> 00:32:45,676
No, I'm pretty sure that's you.

588
00:32:47,326 --> 00:32:49,157
Now, what are you doing here?

589
00:32:49,206 --> 00:32:50,924
What are you doing here? Go home.

590
00:32:50,966 --> 00:32:52,684
-l tried.
-And?

591
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:56,555
Nah, you wouldn't understand.

592
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:59,600
So you think you're so special
that a nobody like me

593
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:03,082
couldn't possibly understand
how hard it is to be you?

594
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:05,685
Okay.

595
00:33:05,726 --> 00:33:10,117
There were about 1 0 paparazzi parked
outside my house with their cameras.

596
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:14,078
Yeah, that is tough.

597
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:16,800
Not.

598
00:33:17,526 --> 00:33:19,403
See, you don't understand.

599
00:33:19,446 --> 00:33:23,519
I just need to get home in a car
the paparazzi won't recognise.

600
00:33:27,326 --> 00:33:29,237
So what are you driving?

601
00:33:30,206 --> 00:33:33,323
Oh, you'd love it. lt's a classic.
Really vintage.

602
00:33:33,366 --> 00:33:34,845
Perfect. I could pay you.

603
00:33:34,886 --> 00:33:36,399
-l know that's kind of...
-Stop that!

604
00:33:36,446 --> 00:33:38,482
-Stop what?
-Throwing your money around.

605
00:33:38,526 --> 00:33:42,883
I mean, you still owe me five grand
for staying at Garage de la Grandma.

606
00:33:45,246 --> 00:33:47,555
-Just give me your keys.
-Why?

607
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:52,041
Well, if you're taking our car,
you can't leave us here without one.

608
00:33:52,086 --> 00:33:53,235
Keys.

609
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:56,365
Come on.

610
00:34:00,926 --> 00:34:02,598
Okay, look, she's a...

611
00:34:02,646 --> 00:34:04,364
She's a 300 and...

612
00:34:04,886 --> 00:34:06,604
Three hundred
and thirty-five horsepower,

613
00:34:06,646 --> 00:34:10,764
first generation '69 Tudor
with original paint.

614
00:34:11,526 --> 00:34:13,642
Look, I love Cher, okay?

615
00:34:14,006 --> 00:34:15,200
Cher?

616
00:34:16,246 --> 00:34:18,123
You name your cars?

617
00:34:36,406 --> 00:34:38,966
Christopher, meet Petunia.

618
00:34:41,606 --> 00:34:43,483
You've got to be kidding me.

619
00:34:43,526 --> 00:34:46,962
She runs like a top.
Have her back here in an hour.

620
00:34:50,686 --> 00:34:52,199
Down. Get down.

621
00:34:52,246 --> 00:34:55,079
I can't believe it.
How do they know where to find me?

622
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:58,801
My sister knows where to find you,
and she's from Kalamazoo.

623
00:35:03,046 --> 00:35:05,162
All right, here. Put these on.

624
00:35:05,206 --> 00:35:07,561
He's probably under an umbrella.
Look under an umbrella.

625
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,085
-Now!
-Okay.

626
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,236
All right. Get in the car.

627
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:22,124
He's got to be around here, all right.

628
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:24,316
Okay, you really need
to stop hitting me.

629
00:35:24,366 --> 00:35:27,517
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Just get in. Get in. Get in!

630
00:35:31,246 --> 00:35:32,838
Quick, buckle up. Put your head down.

631
00:35:32,886 --> 00:35:35,639
-Put your head down. Head down.
-lt's down.

632
00:35:37,766 --> 00:35:39,802
-What are you doing?
-I'm looking for something.

633
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,518
Here, put this on.

634
00:35:41,646 --> 00:35:43,045
-What... Why?
-Do it now!

635
00:35:43,086 --> 00:35:44,121
-Come on.
-Okay.

636
00:36:14,646 --> 00:36:17,365
You know what?
You drive like my grandpa.

637
00:36:17,846 --> 00:36:19,996
And you look like my grandma.

638
00:36:21,086 --> 00:36:23,395
-Okay.
-l need my sunglasses back.

639
00:36:23,446 --> 00:36:25,801
I don't know. I kind of like them.

640
00:36:25,846 --> 00:36:28,599
-I'll give them to you. Later.
-For reals?

641
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:31,001
Because my friends just won't believe
that l, Jessica Olson,

642
00:36:31,046 --> 00:36:32,877
have an actual pair
of Christopher Wilde sunglasses

643
00:36:32,926 --> 00:36:35,486
worn by Christopher Wilde himself.

644
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:38,282
Will you autograph them for me?

645
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:40,396
-Very funny.
-What?

646
00:36:40,446 --> 00:36:43,199
No, but seriously.
I really want these glasses.

647
00:36:43,246 --> 00:36:45,077
Give them. Come on.

648
00:36:45,886 --> 00:36:49,401
So, how long do I have to
drive around with you this time?

649
00:36:49,446 --> 00:36:51,482
Only until the paparazzi
leave the beach.

650
00:36:51,526 --> 00:36:53,801
-Hey, let's go do something.
-Like what?

651
00:36:53,846 --> 00:36:55,916
Anything. What have you seen
since you've been here?

652
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:59,083
Nothing. l've been too busy
following you around.

653
00:37:00,366 --> 00:37:03,085
-Really?
-With my sister.

654
00:37:03,126 --> 00:37:04,844
She idolises you.

655
00:37:04,886 --> 00:37:07,923
I mean, l, on the other hand,
couldn't care less about you

656
00:37:07,966 --> 00:37:09,479
or your city.

657
00:37:09,806 --> 00:37:12,081
Well, I know you don't like me,
but don't take it out on Los Angeles.

658
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:13,878
This is one of the greatest cities
in the world.

659
00:37:13,926 --> 00:37:17,202
-Really?
-In fact, I'll be your tour guide.

660
00:37:17,246 --> 00:37:18,884
I thought you needed to get home.

661
00:37:18,926 --> 00:37:20,996
Nah. Take the long way.

662
00:37:30,766 --> 00:37:32,996
Wake up to the blue sky

663
00:37:33,046 --> 00:37:36,641
Grab your shades
and let's go for a ride

664
00:37:38,086 --> 00:37:40,156
Breakfast by the ocean

665
00:37:40,526 --> 00:37:43,677
We'll do lunch at Sunset and Vine

It's all about the shopping

Not any more.

718
00:40:17,446 --> 00:40:20,040
Man. I need to lose these vans.

719
00:40:24,806 --> 00:40:26,125
Okay. Take your next left.

720
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:27,758
-You're sure?
-Yes.

721
00:40:41,726 --> 00:40:46,277
Okay, if you take your next left,
the road loops back to the highway.

722
00:40:48,206 --> 00:40:50,242
Or maybe not.

723
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:53,244
This isn't even a road any more.
This is a firebreak, it has to be.

724
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:55,481
Just... Just keep driving.

725
00:40:55,766 --> 00:40:58,360
That last sign said ''Deer crossing.''
There are no deer.

726
00:40:58,406 --> 00:41:00,442
You know,
you complain more than my sister.

727
00:41:00,486 --> 00:41:02,681
Are we on the right road or not?

728
00:41:03,526 --> 00:41:05,721
-Not?
-Show it to me.

729
00:41:05,766 --> 00:41:07,722
No! Keep your eyes on the road.
I'm the navigator.

730
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:09,165
ls that what you call it?

731
00:41:09,206 --> 00:41:11,436
-What's that supposed to mean?
-lt means you're such a know-it-all.

732
00:41:11,486 --> 00:41:13,158
-A what?
-A know-it-all!

733
00:41:13,206 --> 00:41:15,322
God, you are the queen
of snap judgements.

734
00:41:15,366 --> 00:41:17,118
''Turn here! This is the right road!
I'm sure of it!''

735
00:41:17,166 --> 00:41:18,758
-l was sure of it.
-You're sure.

736
00:41:18,806 --> 00:41:20,603
You're so sure of things
you couldn't possibly be sure about.

737
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:23,001
-l am not.
-And you're defensive.

738
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:25,355
Move the car! We're not moving.

739
00:41:38,686 --> 00:41:39,835
Great.

740
00:41:42,486 --> 00:41:44,283
We'll have to get out and push.

741
00:41:44,326 --> 00:41:46,965
-Wait, wait, wait. Look, I'll help you.
-Don't touch me.

742
00:41:47,006 --> 00:41:50,282
-Why are you so mad?
-l don't know. This.

743
00:41:50,326 --> 00:41:51,759
Look, turning onto this road
was not my idea.

744
00:41:51,806 --> 00:41:53,797
-You're blaming me?
-Yeah, you're a terrible navigator!

745
00:41:53,846 --> 00:41:55,837
-You're a terrible driver!
-Hey, I'm a great driver.

746
00:41:55,886 --> 00:41:57,114
Right.

747
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:59,122
-Jess, we're gonna have to jump.
-I'm not jumping.

748
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:02,203
-You got a better idea?
-Use the branch as a bridge.

749
00:42:02,726 --> 00:42:05,160
-lt does not look stable.
-lt looks fine.

750
00:42:05,206 --> 00:42:06,639
All right.

751
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:13,283
Here goes. All right.

752
00:42:15,806 --> 00:42:17,398
lt's sinking and making noises.

753
00:42:17,446 --> 00:42:18,879
-Go faster.
-Okay!

754
00:42:19,966 --> 00:42:21,399
This is my grandma's car!

755
00:42:21,446 --> 00:42:24,199
I understand that.
Just give me your hand.

756
00:42:30,646 --> 00:42:33,399
You okay? Grab the branch!
Grab the branch!

757
00:42:59,726 --> 00:43:02,684
-Excuse you.
-You killed Petunia!

758
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:07,035
Well... Yeah.

759
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:11,278
My backpack! Don't just stand there.
Help me!

760
00:43:11,646 --> 00:43:13,637
Here. Here. Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

761
00:43:13,686 --> 00:43:15,278
-Come on.
-I'm dead. I'm dead.

762
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:16,964
I'm gonna die,
that's what's gonna happen,

763
00:43:17,006 --> 00:43:19,566
'cause my parents are gonna kill me.

764
00:43:19,606 --> 00:43:21,198
Why did I have to get in that stupid car
with you?

765
00:43:21,246 --> 00:43:23,555
-Answer your phone!
-Okay. Sorry.

766
00:43:26,446 --> 00:43:28,801
-Dad?
-Yeah... Son? Can you hear me?

767
00:43:29,446 --> 00:43:33,041
-Hello?
-We are a little worried over here and...

768
00:43:33,086 --> 00:43:34,201
Can you hear me?

769
00:43:35,606 --> 00:43:37,403
Dad? There's no signal.
Can you hear me?

770
00:43:38,126 --> 00:43:41,755
Christopher, come home, honey, okay?
Or call us.

771
00:43:42,246 --> 00:43:43,565
Do you... Hello?

772
00:43:44,646 --> 00:43:45,795
Hello?

773
00:43:53,046 --> 00:43:55,116
Look at this!

774
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,997
When we get out of here,
you're paying for a new one.

775
00:43:57,046 --> 00:43:59,116
I'm paying for it right now.

776
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,364
-Jess.
-What?

777
00:44:03,406 --> 00:44:04,475
Where are you going?

778
00:44:04,526 --> 00:44:07,836
To the beach where my sister
is probably freaking out right now.

779
00:44:08,006 --> 00:44:10,076
-Jess?
-What?

780
00:44:11,086 --> 00:44:12,519
Beach is that way.

781
00:44:22,166 --> 00:44:23,360
Please.

782
00:44:52,886 --> 00:44:55,036
Christopher John Wilde.

783
00:44:56,246 --> 00:44:59,397
Come on. Am I being Punk'd?

784
00:45:03,046 --> 00:45:05,879
-Hey, how you doing? You okay?
-Now you're concerned?

785
00:45:05,966 --> 00:45:07,240
You know, l've always been concerned.

786
00:45:07,286 --> 00:45:09,481
-Maybe you should stop.
-Why are you so grumpy?

787
00:45:09,526 --> 00:45:13,121
I'm not grumpy or cranky or crabby!
I just wanna get home to my family,

788
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:15,999
explain why I disappeared,
and suffer the consequences.

789
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,116
You want to know what I want?
I wanna have fun.

790
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:20,680
Okay, for the first time in years,
there's no reporters,

791
00:45:20,726 --> 00:45:23,286
there's no interviews,
there's no crowds.

792
00:45:23,326 --> 00:45:27,399
I'm having a great time. I want you
to stop complaining so I can enjoy it!

793
00:45:27,446 --> 00:45:29,323
Wow, so that's what it's like with you?

794
00:45:29,366 --> 00:45:32,756
You don't get what you want so you
throw a big ol' tantrum and walk away?

795
00:45:32,806 --> 00:45:35,957
You know, I'll bet your friends
chase after you when you do that.

796
00:45:36,006 --> 00:45:39,316
Christopher, I'm so sorry
I hurt your delicate little feelings.

797
00:45:39,366 --> 00:45:41,118
Christopher, forgive me
for not treating you

798
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:43,521
like the big enormous star
you think you are.

799
00:45:43,566 --> 00:45:45,477
What a brat.

800
00:45:45,526 --> 00:45:48,359
I'm a brat? I'm a brat?
What about you, huh?

801
00:45:48,566 --> 00:45:49,635
-Me?
-Yeah.

802
00:45:49,686 --> 00:45:51,836
Over the last two days,
l've done nothing but think about you.

803
00:45:51,886 --> 00:45:55,242
Really? So when you hit me
with a door twice,

804
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:57,481
hid me in your house,
wrecked my grandma's car

805
00:45:57,526 --> 00:46:00,836
and dropped me in mud,
you were just being thoughtful?

806
00:46:01,046 --> 00:46:03,879
-l pity your friends.
-You wish you were one.

807
00:46:05,166 --> 00:46:07,441
l'd rather go down with Petunia.

808
00:46:11,366 --> 00:46:12,765
You know what,
I'm confused about something.

809
00:46:12,806 --> 00:46:13,955
What?

810
00:46:14,886 --> 00:46:17,320
Okay, when we were
on our little photography tour,

811
00:46:17,366 --> 00:46:19,834
-l thought you liked me.
-You thought wrong.

812
00:46:19,886 --> 00:46:22,241
But everyone likes me.
Why is it that you don't like me?

813
00:46:22,286 --> 00:46:24,675
Maybe because you think
everybody likes you.

814
00:46:24,726 --> 00:46:27,638
-lt's 'cause I'm likeable.
-No, because you're a star.

815
00:46:27,686 --> 00:46:31,395
-What does that mean?
-You don't even see it, do you?

816
00:46:32,806 --> 00:46:34,762
Your life isn't real.

817
00:46:34,806 --> 00:46:37,957
You park in no-parking zones,
you never have to wait in line,

818
00:46:38,006 --> 00:46:41,476
you buy anything you want, anytime.
Your house is like a hotel.

819
00:46:41,526 --> 00:46:43,994
You have so many people
working for you,

820
00:46:44,046 --> 00:46:46,924
and I'll bet
you don't even know their names.

821
00:46:46,966 --> 00:46:48,763
-Do, too.
-Name one.

822
00:46:49,126 --> 00:46:51,924
-Bob.
-You just made that up.

823
00:46:53,846 --> 00:46:56,679
Well, okay, Stubby knows everybody.
That's his job.

824
00:46:56,726 --> 00:47:00,514
See, that's not normal.
Okay, your best friend is your driver,

825
00:47:00,566 --> 00:47:02,841
your parents are on your payroll,
and your girlfriend...

826
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:06,242
I mean, real people date someone
because they want to be with them.

827
00:47:06,286 --> 00:47:07,844
Why are you with Alexis?

828
00:47:12,006 --> 00:47:13,837
That's all I'm saying.

829
00:47:15,286 --> 00:47:18,801
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on.
Wait. Stop. What...

830
00:47:18,846 --> 00:47:21,280
Are you saying I'm not a real person?
Because I am.

831
00:47:21,326 --> 00:47:23,157
I stand corrected.

832
00:47:24,526 --> 00:47:26,323
Well, all right. Well, what if I told you
something about me

833
00:47:26,366 --> 00:47:27,401
that no one else knew?

834
00:47:27,446 --> 00:47:29,118
You collect your toenails
in a peanut butter jar?

835
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:31,441
-No. What... No.
-Then what?

836
00:47:31,486 --> 00:47:34,364
Well, from the first day I met you,
I just... Whoa!

837
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:36,039
Christopher!

838
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:42,919
-l can't swim.
-No.

839
00:47:47,646 --> 00:47:49,955
-Gotcha!
-What? You're evil.

840
00:47:50,006 --> 00:47:52,315
-You deserved it.
-You're so evil.

841
00:47:54,646 --> 00:47:57,206
-You're gonna get it.
-You can try.

842
00:47:57,246 --> 00:47:59,123
Get over here. No. Come on.

843
00:48:00,006 --> 00:48:01,917
-Got you.
-I'm gonna get you.

844
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:11,441
-This is nice, isn't it?
-Man.

845
00:48:12,126 --> 00:48:14,765
I wish I could just stay here
where no one can find me.

846
00:48:14,806 --> 00:48:15,875
Why?

847
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:18,156
'Cause they all want something
from me.

848
00:48:18,206 --> 00:48:21,243
A performance, or an interview,
or a photograph.

849
00:48:21,446 --> 00:48:24,483
-Even your parents?
-That's complicated.

850
00:48:25,366 --> 00:48:27,482
You know, sometimes I feel like
they only care about the business

851
00:48:27,526 --> 00:48:30,120
-of ''Christopher Wilde.''
-I'm sure that's not true.

852
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:34,000
I don't know. I feel like all we talk
about right now is this movie deal.

853
00:48:34,046 --> 00:48:36,401
They think
it's my next big career move, so...

854
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:37,925
Well, what do you think?

855
00:48:37,966 --> 00:48:39,718
Think if I get the offer, I have to take it.

856
00:48:39,766 --> 00:48:42,280
-What about your tour?
-What about it?

857
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:46,765
Well, 30 countries, 1 2 weeks.

858
00:48:46,806 --> 00:48:49,036
One million screaming fans.

859
00:48:49,566 --> 00:48:52,524
I mean, I'm not an expert or anything,
but it seems like a lot,

860
00:48:52,566 --> 00:48:55,126
the tour and the movie
at the same time.

861
00:48:55,486 --> 00:48:56,805
I don't have a choice.

862
00:48:56,846 --> 00:48:59,644
Everyone has a choice.
What do you wanna do?

863
00:49:01,206 --> 00:49:02,480
Well, I know what I don't wanna do.

864
00:49:02,526 --> 00:49:04,835
I don't wanna disappoint anybody.
Especially my fans.

865
00:49:04,886 --> 00:49:06,842
I wouldn't be where I am
without them, so...

866
00:49:06,886 --> 00:49:09,878
I just never say no. To anything.

867
00:49:12,806 --> 00:49:14,762
Maybe I don't understand.

868
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:17,282
-What?
-Your life.

869
00:49:17,326 --> 00:49:19,920
I mean, it's so different from mine.

870
00:49:19,966 --> 00:49:23,322
Everything you do and say
is so big and public.

871
00:49:24,366 --> 00:49:25,879
Not everything.

872
00:49:26,566 --> 00:49:30,525
Right now, here with you,
I feel like I can just be myself.

873
00:49:31,326 --> 00:49:36,878
Not Christopher Wilde. Not famous.
Just... You know, just me.

874
00:49:38,046 --> 00:49:40,640
-How do you like it?
-l like it a lot.

875
00:49:43,206 --> 00:49:44,434
Me, too.

876
00:49:45,926 --> 00:49:47,996
So tell me something about you.

877
00:49:48,046 --> 00:49:50,560
-What do you wanna know?
-Everything.

878
00:49:51,286 --> 00:49:54,562
That could take a while.
I live a very exciting life.

879
00:49:59,326 --> 00:50:01,123
You're doing it again.

880
00:50:01,406 --> 00:50:04,000
-Doing what?
-That thing with your eyes.

881
00:50:04,486 --> 00:50:06,044
You mean this?

882
00:50:07,566 --> 00:50:09,841
Okay, so comedy?
Not your next big career move.

883
00:50:09,886 --> 00:50:11,604
What? No, I'm funny.

884
00:50:11,806 --> 00:50:14,195
-Funny-looking.
-You like me.

885
00:50:14,646 --> 00:50:15,999
You wish.

886
00:50:23,046 --> 00:50:24,479
We should go.

887
00:50:29,566 --> 00:50:32,683
Yeah. Come on.

888
00:50:48,366 --> 00:50:49,560
Stubby?

889
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:53,236
Whoa. Sara?
What are you doing here?

890
00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:57,444
That's not good.

891
00:50:59,966 --> 00:51:02,958
-We made it.
-Yeah. Yeah.

892
00:51:05,246 --> 00:51:08,875
-Look, I had a really great time today.
-Me, too.

893
00:51:09,726 --> 00:51:12,957
You're so different from any other girl
l've ever known.

894
00:51:13,006 --> 00:51:17,477
-Different weird, different annoying?
-Different surprising.

895
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:20,838
In the best way.

896
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:25,636
I mean, you say things to me
everyone else is afraid to say,

897
00:51:26,366 --> 00:51:29,881
and you make me see things
about myself that I can't see.

898
00:51:30,886 --> 00:51:33,605
-You're pretty surprising, too.
-Really? How?

899
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:36,321
Well, for one thing,
you're a terrible driver,

900
00:51:36,366 --> 00:51:38,675
which is strange for a guy with six cars.

901
00:51:38,726 --> 00:51:40,125
I'm wounded.

902
00:51:42,326 --> 00:51:44,886
Do you really think I'm bossy?

903
00:51:45,246 --> 00:51:47,999
No. I think you're amazing.

904
00:51:49,726 --> 00:51:51,842
I think you're amazing, too.

905
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:03,204
What are you doing?

906
00:52:05,526 --> 00:52:07,005
That was close.

907
00:52:08,366 --> 00:52:12,803
Okay. Back to the real world.
You know what happens next, right?

908
00:52:13,926 --> 00:52:16,076
-No.
-This ends here.

909
00:52:17,006 --> 00:52:19,440
-What does?
-This. Us.

910
00:52:19,646 --> 00:52:21,159
You can't tell anybody
about what happened today.

911
00:52:21,206 --> 00:52:22,844
Not even your parents.

912
00:52:22,886 --> 00:52:25,116
Why? They're not gonna go post it
on their blog or anything.

913
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:28,841
Look, if we go down there, if we get
photographed together, it'll get crazy.

914
00:52:28,886 --> 00:52:31,764
-And I won't get this movie deal.
-Why does it have to get crazy?

915
00:52:31,806 --> 00:52:35,401
Because I'm Christopher Wilde.
You're just an ordinary girl.

916
00:52:37,286 --> 00:52:38,878
I have to go now.

917
00:52:39,526 --> 00:52:43,565
Wait, Jess! Jess! Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on. What just happened?

918
00:52:44,006 --> 00:52:46,440
You tell me. One second I'm amazing

919
00:52:46,486 --> 00:52:48,795
and the next you're embarrassed
to be seen with me?

920
00:52:48,846 --> 00:52:51,519
-Jess, I'm not embarrassed...
-Really?

921
00:52:51,566 --> 00:52:53,875
lf I was Alexis Bender,
you'd rush right down there

922
00:52:53,926 --> 00:52:56,565
and make sure
somebody took our picture.

923
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:59,962
-But, no, I'm just an ordinary girl!
-That is not what I meant.

924
00:53:00,006 --> 00:53:03,442
Look, I meant you're normal.
I want you to stay that way.

925
00:53:04,086 --> 00:53:06,680
Right. Just leave me alone.

926
00:53:06,966 --> 00:53:08,797
Jess. Stop. Please.

927
00:53:10,606 --> 00:53:11,675
What?

928
00:53:12,966 --> 00:53:17,960
The pictures you took. Of us.
I should probably keep them.

929
00:53:18,726 --> 00:53:22,275
-You want my camera?
-Just in case.

930
00:53:23,486 --> 00:53:26,637
I wouldn't want the pictures to,
you know, get out.

931
00:53:27,406 --> 00:53:29,920
Fine. You want my pictures? Here.

932
00:53:29,966 --> 00:53:32,719
There's nothing
l'd wanna remember anyway.

933
00:53:42,406 --> 00:53:44,476
I need cab fare to get home.

934
00:53:50,366 --> 00:53:53,403
-I'm going to Hollywood, not Hawaii.
-Just keep it.

935
00:53:53,446 --> 00:53:56,961
I still owe you for my stay
at Garage de la Grandma.

936
00:53:57,606 --> 00:54:01,155
Jess, wait.
I don't wanna say goodbye like this.

937
00:54:01,766 --> 00:54:03,358
Okay, how about this?

938
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,874
How about we both forget
this whole day ever happened?

939
00:54:05,926 --> 00:54:09,441
You won't talk about me
and I promise I won't talk about you.

940
00:54:09,486 --> 00:54:12,319
Go ahead and judge me, okay,
but you don't know what it'll be like.

941
00:54:12,366 --> 00:54:15,244
The paparazzi never go away.
And once they have you in their sights,

942
00:54:15,286 --> 00:54:17,117
they won't quit
until they get what they want.

943
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:20,636
And when they finally get it,
they'll turn it into something ugly.

944
00:54:20,686 --> 00:54:22,244
They'll ruin everything.

945
00:54:22,566 --> 00:54:25,603
They don't have to. You already did.

946
00:54:36,286 --> 00:54:41,314
I'm no superman
I can't take your hand

947
00:54:41,366 --> 00:54:46,315
And fly you anywhere
you wanna go, yeah

948
00:54:46,726 --> 00:54:51,880
I can't read your mind
Like a billboard sign

949
00:54:51,926 --> 00:54:55,680
And tell you everything
you wanna hear

950
00:54:55,726 --> 00:55:01,323
But I'll be your hero

951
00:55:01,366 --> 00:55:06,235
'Cause I, I can be everything you need

952
00:55:06,286 --> 00:55:07,878
If you're the one for me

953
00:55:07,926 --> 00:55:11,760
Like gravity, I'll be unstoppable

954
00:55:11,806 --> 00:55:15,845
I, yeah, I believe in destiny

955
00:55:15,886 --> 00:55:21,085
I may be an ordinary guy
with heart and soul

956
00:55:21,326 --> 00:55:25,035
But if you're the one for me

957
00:55:25,086 --> 00:55:27,316
Then I'll be your hero

958
00:55:27,606 --> 00:55:30,245
Could you be the one
Could you be the one for me?

959
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:31,514
Then I'll be your hero

960
00:55:31,566 --> 00:55:33,921
Could you be the one
Could you be the one

961
00:55:33,966 --> 00:55:35,194
Could you be the one for me?

962
00:55:35,246 --> 00:55:36,964
Then I'll be your hero

963
00:55:37,006 --> 00:55:41,682
Searching high and low
Trying every road

964
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:46,522
But if I see your face
how will I know, yeah

965
00:55:46,846 --> 00:55:51,840
I'll put my trust in fate
That you will come my way

966
00:55:51,966 --> 00:55:56,323
And if it's right, it's undeniable, yeah

967
00:55:56,366 --> 00:56:01,360
I'll be your hero

968
00:56:01,406 --> 00:56:05,445
I, I can be everything you need

969
00:56:05,486 --> 00:56:07,204
If you're the one for me

970
00:56:07,246 --> 00:56:11,159
Like gravity, I'll be unstoppable

971
00:56:11,206 --> 00:56:15,438
I, yeah, I believe in destiny

972
00:56:15,486 --> 00:56:20,560
I may be an ordinary guy
with heart and soul

973
00:56:20,806 --> 00:56:24,355
But if you're the one for me

974
00:56:24,406 --> 00:56:26,078
Then I'll be your hero

975
00:56:26,166 --> 00:56:28,361
Could you be the one
Could you be the one

976
00:56:28,406 --> 00:56:29,725
Could you be the one for me?

977
00:56:29,766 --> 00:56:31,040
I'll be your hero

978
00:56:31,086 --> 00:56:33,281
Could you be the one
Could you be the one

979
00:56:33,326 --> 00:56:34,600
Could you be the one for me?

980
00:56:34,646 --> 00:56:36,523
I'll be your hero

981
00:56:36,566 --> 00:56:41,162
So incredible
Some kind of miracle

982
00:56:41,206 --> 00:56:43,197
That when it's meant to be

983
00:56:43,246 --> 00:56:47,364
I'll become a hero, oh

984
00:56:47,406 --> 00:56:53,879
So I'll wait, wait, wait, wait for you

985
00:56:54,366 --> 00:56:57,278
Yeah, I'll be your hero

986
00:57:00,766 --> 00:57:04,918
I, I could be everything you need

987
00:57:04,966 --> 00:57:06,718
If you're the one for me

988
00:57:06,766 --> 00:57:09,758
Like gravity, I'll be unstoppable

989
00:57:10,806 --> 00:57:14,799
I, yeah, I believe in destiny

990
00:57:14,846 --> 00:57:20,318
I may be an ordinary guy
with heart and soul

991
00:57:20,366 --> 00:57:24,120
But if you're the one for me

992
00:57:24,166 --> 00:57:25,519
Then I'll be your hero

993
00:57:25,566 --> 00:57:27,682
Could you be the one
Could you be the one

994
00:57:27,726 --> 00:57:29,079
Could you be the one for me?

995
00:57:29,126 --> 00:57:31,515
Then I'll be your hero

996
00:57:31,566 --> 00:57:34,034
Could you be the one
Could you be the one for me?

997
00:57:34,086 --> 00:57:36,725
Then I'll be your hero

998
00:57:37,566 --> 00:57:39,158
That was great, Chris. Take five.

999
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:42,164
Thanks, guys. That was great.
Let's take a break.

1000
00:57:42,206 --> 00:57:43,434
All right, man.

1001
00:57:46,206 --> 00:57:49,118
-Good job, guys. Yeah.
-Hey, wait up.

1002
00:57:59,526 --> 00:58:01,960
Yo. You okay?

1003
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:06,402
Yeah. Yeah,
I just can't get her out of my mind.

1004
00:58:07,246 --> 00:58:11,205
Yeah, me neither.
She cacked all over my shoes.

1005
00:58:14,526 --> 00:58:16,642
I mean, she's real, you know?

1006
00:58:16,686 --> 00:58:21,282
She's annoyingly honest, she's smart,
she's cool, she's funny, she's beautiful.

1007
00:58:21,326 --> 00:58:22,395
Yeah.

1008
00:58:22,846 --> 00:58:24,325
Hello, boys.

1009
00:58:25,646 --> 00:58:27,238
Talking about me?

1010
00:58:29,406 --> 00:58:30,521
Dude.

1011
00:58:32,806 --> 00:58:35,718
-Look, Alexis, I can explain...
-l don't want to know who she is.

1012
00:58:36,086 --> 00:58:38,884
ls she an actress?
ls she more famous than me?

1013
00:58:38,926 --> 00:58:42,316
No. No, she's not an actress.
She's not famous at all.

1014
00:58:42,726 --> 00:58:45,798
Then I really don't understand
why you would pick her.

1015
00:58:45,846 --> 00:58:48,314
I didn't pick her.
lt just kind of happened.

1016
00:58:48,366 --> 00:58:51,802
Silly. That kind of stuff
only happens in the movies.

1017
00:58:51,846 --> 00:58:53,359
This is the real world.

1018
00:58:55,846 --> 00:58:58,599
I have a date with Zac. I have to go.

1019
00:58:58,806 --> 00:59:01,604
Whoa. Are you breaking up with me?

1020
00:59:03,486 --> 00:59:04,635
Okay.

1021
00:59:05,526 --> 00:59:07,676
-Friends?
-Sure.

1022
00:59:26,326 --> 00:59:30,319
-Bye, Grandma. I love you.
-Goodbye, Sara. I love you more.

1023
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:34,086
-You sure you're gonna be okay, Mom?
-Yes, Barbara.

1024
00:59:34,126 --> 00:59:36,924
And you mustn't believe
what you read about old folks.

1025
00:59:36,966 --> 00:59:40,959
-Howard and I are gonna be just fine.
-l can see that.

1026
00:59:41,606 --> 00:59:43,836
-Love you.
-Love you. Love you.

1027
00:59:47,006 --> 00:59:50,203
And how about you, Jess?
Are you gonna be all right?

1028
00:59:50,966 --> 00:59:54,436
Sweetheart. I know it hurts right now,

1029
00:59:55,606 --> 00:59:59,315
but things are not always
what they seem in the moment.

1030
00:59:59,366 --> 01:00:03,564
Given some time, life has a way
of working itself out for the better.

1031
01:00:04,046 --> 01:00:07,118
-Really, Grandma?
-Yup. I mean, look at me.

1032
01:00:08,126 --> 01:00:11,596
l've been trying to get rid of that ugly
old car since your grandpa died.

1033
01:00:11,766 --> 01:00:14,200
-Honey.
-l love you, Grandma.

1034
01:00:14,246 --> 01:00:16,202
I love you, sweetheart.

1035
01:00:20,246 --> 01:00:22,237
-Bye, Howard.
-Take care, sweetheart.

1036
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:23,514
You, too.

1037
01:00:24,766 --> 01:00:26,563
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

1038
01:00:30,606 --> 01:00:32,119
Bye, everybody!

1039
01:00:35,806 --> 01:00:38,240
Jessica Olson.

1040
01:00:39,246 --> 01:00:43,159
-Such a nice name for a nice girl.
-Where'd you get that?

1041
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:44,844
Where do you think I got it,
Christopher?

1042
01:00:44,886 --> 01:00:47,605
Libby Lam has had a whole fleet
of photographers on you

1043
01:00:47,646 --> 01:00:51,002
-for the past two days.
-l know, but I was so careful.

1044
01:00:51,046 --> 01:00:54,595
Now, this is exactly the kind of thing
I was afraid of with you, kid.

1045
01:00:54,646 --> 01:00:57,240
I mean, you're obviously not serious
about doing this movie.

1046
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:58,685
I don't know,
maybe you're just too young.

1047
01:00:58,726 --> 01:01:01,877
No, sir. Look, I made a mistake.

1048
01:01:02,006 --> 01:01:05,965
Come on, Alan.
Give us a chance to fix this.

1049
01:01:09,526 --> 01:01:13,201
All right, all right.
Make the story go away.

1050
01:01:13,646 --> 01:01:16,114
-How do we do that?
-You call Libby Lam.

1051
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:19,476
You offer her an exclusive.
You say you don't know this girl.

1052
01:01:19,526 --> 01:01:23,041
You say she's just some fan
who was following you around all day.

1053
01:01:23,086 --> 01:01:25,475
-You want me to lie?
-Christopher!

1054
01:01:25,526 --> 01:01:29,201
This is the tabloid press, dude.
This is not the Supreme Court.

1055
01:01:29,246 --> 01:01:30,838
Say whatever you have to say,

1056
01:01:30,886 --> 01:01:36,722
because I promise you, either this girl
goes away or the movie does. Okay?

1057
01:01:41,686 --> 01:01:42,914
Goodbye.

1058
01:01:46,406 --> 01:01:50,922
So we're talking about this girl,
Jessica Olson.

1059
01:01:52,406 --> 01:01:55,637
-Yeah, she looks kind of familiar.
-Come on, Christopher.

1060
01:01:55,686 --> 01:01:57,563
We know you were at the beach
with her.

1061
01:01:57,606 --> 01:02:00,484
Look, lots of fans come to Malibu
to watch me surf,

1062
01:02:00,526 --> 01:02:03,484
and I try to say hi to everybody
that comes up to me, but...

1063
01:02:03,926 --> 01:02:04,995
Please.

1064
01:02:05,046 --> 01:02:07,162
Maybe I signed an autograph for her
or something.

1065
01:02:07,246 --> 01:02:09,043
Excuse us. lt's okay.

1066
01:02:09,086 --> 01:02:10,280
According to our sources,

1067
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:12,920
she came all the way from Kalamazoo,
Michigan, just to see you.

1068
01:02:12,966 --> 01:02:15,639
-Coming through. Enough of that.
-Wow, really?

1069
01:02:15,686 --> 01:02:17,165
I'm sorry
I didn't get the chance to meet her.

1070
01:02:17,206 --> 01:02:18,434
Going inside.

1071
01:02:22,326 --> 01:02:24,123
You have to talk to us, Jess.

1072
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:26,122
What happened out there in California?

1073
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:28,043
Nothing bad, I promise.

1074
01:02:28,086 --> 01:02:31,965
I can't talk about it.
Please, please, just trust me.

1075
01:02:33,286 --> 01:02:36,642
Christopher Wilde
is talking about you on Starstruck!

1076
01:02:37,366 --> 01:02:41,075
So you're saying
that you don't know this girl.

1077
01:02:41,646 --> 01:02:44,922
Yeah. I mean, I don't know
what she's saying about me,

1078
01:02:44,966 --> 01:02:47,844
but I don't know anybody
named Jessica Olson.

1079
01:02:47,886 --> 01:02:50,684
Sorry, Libby,
there's nothing more to tell.

1080
01:02:51,086 --> 01:02:53,884
Okay. You heard it here first.

1081
01:02:53,926 --> 01:02:56,565
I'm Libby Lam. This is Starstruck News.

1082
01:03:01,806 --> 01:03:05,640
I can't believe they're still out there.
Why don't they just go home?

1083
01:03:05,886 --> 01:03:08,923
Because they haven't got
what they came for yet.

1084
01:03:09,526 --> 01:03:11,835
You know,
you should just go talk to them.

1085
01:03:11,886 --> 01:03:14,605
I mean,
you're already all over the lnternet.

1086
01:03:14,646 --> 01:03:16,602
-l am?
-Yeah!

1087
01:03:16,886 --> 01:03:21,243
There's like a whole website devoted
to what people think about Chrissica.

1088
01:03:21,326 --> 01:03:22,839
''Chrissica''?

1089
01:03:27,606 --> 01:03:31,599
Wow.
You really shouldn't read any of these.

1090
01:03:32,766 --> 01:03:34,996
Wait, wait, here's a good one.

1091
01:03:35,486 --> 01:03:39,035
''That Jessica Olson chick
is a real nut, dude.

1092
01:03:39,086 --> 01:03:43,443
''She just wants to be famous.
She should get a life because she...''

1093
01:03:57,526 --> 01:03:59,323
Guys, stop. Just stop.

1094
01:04:00,846 --> 01:04:04,555
Maybe it's the phrasing or the tempo.
Something's not right.

1095
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:10,958
-Yo, what's up with you, man?
-l don't know.

1096
01:04:11,286 --> 01:04:14,039
You want to know what I think?
Sure you do.

1097
01:04:14,246 --> 01:04:16,316
I think you're still torn up about Jessica.

1098
01:04:16,366 --> 01:04:18,402
No. I'm good. I'm over her.

1099
01:04:26,926 --> 01:04:29,804
All my life people telling me
just who I am

1100
01:04:29,846 --> 01:04:32,644
They don't wanna know
They don't really understand

1101
01:04:32,686 --> 01:04:35,359
Too many people trying to tell me
to be practical

1102
01:04:35,406 --> 01:04:38,557
Only think that I am one-dimensional

1103
01:04:38,606 --> 01:04:41,678
But I can feel it
There's a fire raging underneath

1104
01:04:41,726 --> 01:04:44,445
Burning through the pages
here I am coming clean

1105
01:04:44,486 --> 01:04:47,319
I'm sick of lying to myself
Gotta live the truth

1106
01:04:47,366 --> 01:04:50,915
Now I gotta do what I gotta do

1107
01:04:50,966 --> 01:04:54,197
This is where I should be

1108
01:04:54,246 --> 01:04:56,806
There ain't no other place, yeah

1109
01:04:56,846 --> 01:05:00,043
Where my soul really speaks

1110
01:05:00,086 --> 01:05:01,838
There ain't no other way

1111
01:05:01,886 --> 01:05:05,276
I can feel it
save me, move me, shake me

1112
01:05:05,326 --> 01:05:08,602
Gotta go where the music takes me

1113
01:05:08,726 --> 01:05:12,355
Let it set me free

1114
01:05:12,406 --> 01:05:15,318
You got to believe

1115
01:05:20,206 --> 01:05:23,084
Is it a crime to just be who I wanna be?

1116
01:05:23,126 --> 01:05:26,163
I need some space
so that I can chase all my dreams

1117
01:05:26,206 --> 01:05:28,879
'Cause when I hit the stage
anything is possible

1118
01:05:28,926 --> 01:05:31,998
I get lost in the song
and that is magical

1119
01:05:32,046 --> 01:05:34,958
So crank it up, feel the rush
then just turn me loose

1120
01:05:35,006 --> 01:05:37,884
I wanna feel the inspiration
that is coming through

1121
01:05:37,926 --> 01:05:40,884
And there's no other place
where I feel so alive

1122
01:05:40,926 --> 01:05:44,441
When I start to sing you just can't deny

1123
01:05:44,486 --> 01:05:47,603
This is where I should be

1124
01:05:47,646 --> 01:05:50,365
There ain't no other place, yeah

1125
01:05:50,406 --> 01:05:53,478
Where my soul really speaks

1126
01:05:53,526 --> 01:05:55,357
There ain't no other way

1127
01:05:55,406 --> 01:05:58,716
I can feel it
save me, move me, shake me

1128
01:05:58,766 --> 01:06:02,202
Gotta go where the music takes me

1129
01:06:02,246 --> 01:06:05,875
Let it set me free

1130
01:06:05,926 --> 01:06:08,645
You got to believe

1131
01:06:08,686 --> 01:06:11,598
When everybody's gone

1132
01:06:11,646 --> 01:06:14,638
And I'm here all alone

1133
01:06:14,686 --> 01:06:17,359
I don't gotta hide
I don't have to try

1134
01:06:17,486 --> 01:06:20,284
You got to understand

1135
01:06:20,526 --> 01:06:23,916
That this is who I am

1136
01:06:24,086 --> 01:06:27,203
And it's where I shine

1137
01:06:27,246 --> 01:06:31,956
And it's where I shine, I know

1138
01:06:32,086 --> 01:06:35,283
This is where I should be

1139
01:06:35,326 --> 01:06:37,965
There ain't no other place, yeah

1140
01:06:38,006 --> 01:06:41,203
Where my soul really speaks

1141
01:06:41,246 --> 01:06:42,998
There ain't no other way

1142
01:06:43,046 --> 01:06:46,356
I can feel it
save me, move me, shake me

1143
01:06:46,406 --> 01:06:49,796
Gotta go where the music takes me

1144
01:06:49,846 --> 01:06:53,441
Let it set me free

1145
01:06:53,486 --> 01:06:55,841
You got to believe

1146
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:59,037
This is where I should be

1147
01:06:59,086 --> 01:07:01,725
There ain't no other place, yeah

1148
01:07:01,766 --> 01:07:04,917
Where my soul really speaks

1149
01:07:04,966 --> 01:07:06,638
There ain't no other way

1150
01:07:06,686 --> 01:07:10,235
I can feel it move me

1151
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:13,523
Gotta go where the music takes me

1152
01:07:13,566 --> 01:07:17,115
Let it set me free

1153
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:19,441
Let it set me free

1154
01:07:19,486 --> 01:07:23,161
Let it set me free

1155
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:26,084
You got to believe

1156
01:07:36,646 --> 01:07:38,921
You are definitely not over her.

1157
01:07:47,166 --> 01:07:50,715
-Okay, they need to go now.
-l thought you liked being on TV.

1158
01:07:50,766 --> 01:07:55,157
Yeah, but I need to buy a dress for
the dance, and they're blocking my car.

1159
01:07:55,206 --> 01:07:59,119
Christopher said this would happen.
He said it would get crazy.

1160
01:08:00,886 --> 01:08:04,117
Celebrities might have to
put up with this, but I don't.

1161
01:08:06,246 --> 01:08:07,645
Jessica! Jessica.

1162
01:08:07,686 --> 01:08:10,246
Tell us about your weekend
with Christopher Wilde.

1163
01:08:10,286 --> 01:08:11,799
We only want the truth.

1164
01:08:11,846 --> 01:08:15,122
You don't want the truth.
You want a story.

1165
01:08:15,486 --> 01:08:17,204
You take a good, normal person

1166
01:08:17,246 --> 01:08:20,443
and turn him into
your own little reality show.

1167
01:08:20,486 --> 01:08:22,363
You build him up into a big celebrity

1168
01:08:22,406 --> 01:08:25,318
just so you can tear him down
in public.

1169
01:08:25,366 --> 01:08:28,756
Just so you can sell magazines
and TV shows?

1170
01:08:28,806 --> 01:08:30,603
That's really sick.

1171
01:08:31,526 --> 01:08:34,199
And Christopher Wilde's
just one example.

1172
01:08:34,246 --> 01:08:37,283
He's talented and successful.

1173
01:08:37,326 --> 01:08:40,443
He has all the stuff
lots of kids dream of having.

1174
01:08:40,486 --> 01:08:44,604
But thanks to you, he's had to give up
some of the best things in life.

1175
01:08:44,646 --> 01:08:47,365
Freedom. Privacy.

1176
01:08:49,566 --> 01:08:50,999
Honesty.

1177
01:08:52,126 --> 01:08:55,323
So, congratulations,
you've created a celebrity.

1178
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:58,998
But you have wrecked
the human being inside.

1179
01:08:59,286 --> 01:09:01,720
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

1180
01:09:03,286 --> 01:09:04,765
Did you get that?

1181
01:09:04,806 --> 01:09:07,195
Jessica. Jessica,
just one more question.

1182
01:09:07,246 --> 01:09:10,841
In your opinion,
who is Christopher Wilde, really?

1183
01:09:13,486 --> 01:09:17,115
Who is he? I don't know.

1184
01:09:18,566 --> 01:09:21,876
The Christopher Wilde
you're all so obsessed with,

1185
01:09:24,686 --> 01:09:29,237
I promise you, I never met him,
and I wouldn't want to.

1186
01:09:33,006 --> 01:09:36,442
Didn't you say you liked her
because she was so honest?

1187
01:09:36,486 --> 01:09:37,919
-Yeah.
-Wow.

1188
01:09:39,366 --> 01:09:43,359
Congratulations, Chris. You did it.
You got her to lie for you.

1189
01:09:43,406 --> 01:09:45,556
I didn't have a choice, okay?

1190
01:09:47,886 --> 01:09:49,285
All right.

1191
01:09:49,646 --> 01:09:51,602
-Where are you going?
-To find my best friend,

1192
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:53,921
'cause he's not the guy
sitting here now.

1193
01:09:53,966 --> 01:09:57,242
-Dude, what are you talking about?
-''l didn't have a choice.''

1194
01:09:57,286 --> 01:10:00,403
Lately that's been your answer
to everything, man.

1195
01:10:01,926 --> 01:10:03,678
-Really?
-Yeah.

1196
01:10:04,566 --> 01:10:08,445
Your life, your choice, man.
What do you want?

1197
01:10:21,006 --> 01:10:22,041
Cut!

1198
01:10:24,366 --> 01:10:27,517
Guys, you nailed it. Perfect, guys.

1199
01:10:27,566 --> 01:10:31,195
That was the one. That was perfect.
Let's go one more time.

1200
01:10:31,246 --> 01:10:35,558
Circle. Great take. Great... Christopher!

1201
01:10:35,766 --> 01:10:39,202
Buddy. Great news. You're in.
Rehearsals start on Monday.

1202
01:10:40,006 --> 01:10:43,043
-Actually, I'm not available.
-Not a problem. We'll change the date.

1203
01:10:43,086 --> 01:10:45,236
No. I came to say, you know,
thanks for the offer,

1204
01:10:45,286 --> 01:10:49,245
but if I have to lie to be
in your little club, think I'll pass.

1205
01:10:54,326 --> 01:10:58,604
Wow. Kid's got edge. Fire. I like that.

1206
01:11:00,646 --> 01:11:02,238
And cue the rain!

1207
01:11:15,126 --> 01:11:17,924
Okay. He's got two weeks
between Oslo and London.

1208
01:11:17,966 --> 01:11:20,116
We could make him available
for the movie then.

1209
01:11:20,166 --> 01:11:23,317
That's tight.
You know, he needs some downtime.

1210
01:11:24,726 --> 01:11:29,117
Okay. All right. How about after Tokyo,
but before Melbourne?

1211
01:11:29,206 --> 01:11:30,685
-What's going on?
-Hi, honey.

1212
01:11:30,726 --> 01:11:31,841
Hey.

1213
01:11:31,886 --> 01:11:35,003
We're working the movie
into your tour schedule.

1214
01:11:40,246 --> 01:11:42,840
I don't want to do the movie any more.

1215
01:11:42,886 --> 01:11:44,604
Sweetie, don't be silly.
Of course you do.

1216
01:11:44,646 --> 01:11:46,796
We're about to make the deal, bud.

1217
01:11:46,846 --> 01:11:49,565
Well, it's too late. l've already passed.

1218
01:11:50,686 --> 01:11:52,961
Honey, that's not your decision.

1219
01:11:53,686 --> 01:11:55,039
Yes, it is.

1220
01:11:55,806 --> 01:11:59,435
I'm 1 7 years old.
I just want to have fun and make music.

1221
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:02,956
Okay, okay. Hey. No worries.
No worries. We'll handle it.

1222
01:12:03,006 --> 01:12:07,955
No. No. lt's time that I started
managing my own life. So...

1223
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:12,437
You know what? You're fired.

1224
01:12:13,926 --> 01:12:15,041
Wow.

1225
01:12:15,086 --> 01:12:18,681
l'd really like for you
to just be my parents from now on.

1226
01:12:30,326 --> 01:12:31,475
Right.

1227
01:12:33,566 --> 01:12:35,158
Okay, come here.

1228
01:12:37,246 --> 01:12:38,315
Turn.

1229
01:12:40,486 --> 01:12:43,717
lt's just not girly enough.

1230
01:12:43,886 --> 01:12:47,435
But imagine it on me. Girlier, right?

1231
01:12:48,606 --> 01:12:52,121
-Maybe.
-Why don't you just try it on yourself?

1232
01:12:52,526 --> 01:12:54,721
Stop whining. Here.

1233
01:12:55,126 --> 01:12:58,198
We have three hours before the dance.
Go change.

1234
01:13:00,046 --> 01:13:01,161
Kids!

1235
01:13:01,286 --> 01:13:04,084
So what was it like
to have reporters on your lawn?

1236
01:13:04,126 --> 01:13:07,038
Exciting. But I need my privacy, too.

1237
01:13:07,606 --> 01:13:11,599
We all watched your sister on TV,
and she looked wacko.

1238
01:13:12,046 --> 01:13:13,365
-Really?
-Yeah!

1239
01:13:13,406 --> 01:13:15,442
lt was so weird
the way she made up that story

1240
01:13:15,486 --> 01:13:19,718
about meeting Christopher Wilde.
She is so pathetic.

1241
01:13:24,206 --> 01:13:26,162
Do you think she heard that?

1242
01:13:26,206 --> 01:13:28,561
-AJ. You're an idiot.
-What?

1243
01:13:28,606 --> 01:13:29,675
-Get out.
-But...

1244
01:13:29,726 --> 01:13:30,761
Go!

1245
01:13:34,846 --> 01:13:36,916
-Jessica.
-Go away.

1246
01:13:39,406 --> 01:13:41,636
No. I actually live here.

1247
01:13:42,806 --> 01:13:43,921
What?

1248
01:13:45,726 --> 01:13:47,876
Go with me to the dance.

1249
01:13:48,566 --> 01:13:51,285
I thought I was pathetic
and embarrassing.

1250
01:13:52,126 --> 01:13:55,721
Only if you actually dance. So don't.

1251
01:13:55,766 --> 01:13:58,963
Come on. Come on.

1252
01:13:59,566 --> 01:14:02,444
Let's make you pretty enough
to be my sister.

1253
01:14:24,526 --> 01:14:27,518
You look good. Don't slouch.

1254
01:14:30,246 --> 01:14:33,682
You know, Sara, in a weird way,
you're a good sister.

1255
01:14:36,006 --> 01:14:38,076
Pretend you don't know me.

1256
01:14:56,606 --> 01:14:57,925
Lame.

1257
01:15:03,086 --> 01:15:05,042
Oh, my God!

1258
01:15:09,006 --> 01:15:10,519
Jessica Olson?

1259
01:15:21,046 --> 01:15:24,755
There's some things I forgot to say
to you back in California.

1260
01:15:34,086 --> 01:15:36,884
Can't blame you

1261
01:15:36,926 --> 01:15:38,598
For thinking

1262
01:15:38,646 --> 01:15:42,605
That you never really knew me at all

1263
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:47,919
I tried to

1264
01:15:47,966 --> 01:15:49,922
Deny you

1265
01:15:49,966 --> 01:15:54,482
But nothing ever
made me feel so wrong

1266
01:15:55,326 --> 01:16:00,844
I thought I was protecting you
from everything that I go through

1267
01:16:00,886 --> 01:16:05,721
But I know that we got lost
along the way

1268
01:16:06,606 --> 01:16:08,756
Here I am

1269
01:16:08,806 --> 01:16:11,525
With all my heart

1270
01:16:11,566 --> 01:16:14,797
I hope you understand

1271
01:16:14,846 --> 01:16:17,360
I hope you understand

1272
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:21,115
I know I let you down

1273
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:27,321
But I'm never gonna make
that mistake again

1274
01:16:28,846 --> 01:16:34,045
You brought me closer
to who I really am

1275
01:16:34,206 --> 01:16:37,118
So come take my hand

1276
01:16:37,166 --> 01:16:39,361
I want the world to see

1277
01:16:39,406 --> 01:16:41,966
What you mean to me

1278
01:16:44,846 --> 01:16:48,122
What you mean to me

1279
01:16:54,966 --> 01:16:56,319
What did you think?

1280
01:16:56,366 --> 01:16:57,685
That you could just come here
and sing to me

1281
01:16:57,726 --> 01:16:59,796
and everything would be fine?

1282
01:17:01,246 --> 01:17:04,841
Yes. No? No. No.

1283
01:17:05,166 --> 01:17:06,804
Well, which is it?

1284
01:17:07,446 --> 01:17:11,121
I just came to tell you
I was wrong about everything,

1285
01:17:12,046 --> 01:17:13,764
especially about you.

1286
01:17:14,966 --> 01:17:17,321
-Don't you think you're a little late?
-Come on.

1287
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:20,278
Everyone here thinks I was lying.

1288
01:17:20,326 --> 01:17:22,317
But I'm the one who lied.

1289
01:17:28,846 --> 01:17:31,644
I lied about knowing Jessica Olson.

1290
01:17:31,686 --> 01:17:33,995
'Cause the truth is
I know Jessica Olson.

1291
01:17:34,046 --> 01:17:37,755
Jessica Olson's a terrible navigator
and a know-it-all,

1292
01:17:37,806 --> 01:17:39,034
but she's honest.

1293
01:17:39,086 --> 01:17:41,202
When she makes a promise,
she keeps it.

1294
01:17:41,246 --> 01:17:43,965
She understands me
like no one else does.

1295
01:17:45,766 --> 01:17:47,757
And I'm crazy about her.

1296
01:17:48,886 --> 01:17:51,525
Jessica, I'm so sorry.
I know that I hurt you

1297
01:17:51,566 --> 01:17:54,524
and I will never do
anything like that again.

1298
01:17:54,566 --> 01:17:57,603
Just, please, forgive me.

1299
01:18:10,766 --> 01:18:14,964
-Go away. Now.
-Okay. Get out of here. Move it.

1300
01:18:26,326 --> 01:18:30,524
Christopher, this is my sister, Sara.
Sara, this is Christopher Wilde.

1301
01:18:30,566 --> 01:18:33,922
Sara. Do you wanna dance with me?

1302
01:18:37,206 --> 01:18:39,515
I think I got this one, Chrissy.

1303
01:18:42,126 --> 01:18:44,401
You didn't have to come
all the way to Michigan for this.

1304
01:18:44,446 --> 01:18:45,959
Yeah, I did.

1305
01:18:46,006 --> 01:18:47,485
lt's not cool
to ask a girl out on the phone.

1306
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:54,035
So, will you go out with me?
On a real date.

1307
01:18:54,606 --> 01:18:58,235
-Do I have to wear a disguise?
-No.

1308
01:18:58,686 --> 01:19:01,359
-Do you?
-No.

1309
01:19:02,126 --> 01:19:05,038
Then, yeah. l'd really like that.

1310
01:19:08,286 --> 01:19:11,517
I almost forgot. For you.

1311
01:19:11,726 --> 01:19:15,401
You remembered. How do I look?

1312
01:19:17,566 --> 01:19:19,158
Like a superstar.

1313
01:19:26,406 --> 01:19:27,475
Party up

1314
01:19:27,526 --> 01:19:30,359

All night, here we go now
Come on and get right on the floor now

1319
01:19:44,126 --> 01:19:45,878
Nah, nah, baby girl, don't slow down

1320
01:19:45,926 --> 01:19:48,042
'Cause me and you gonna have
a showdown

1321
01:19:48,086 --> 01:19:51,123
Little mama get lowdown

Can't lose with a flow that is so swift

1323
01:19:54,966 --> 01:19:57,924
So maybe when you wake up
and your face still got that grin

1324
01:19:57,966 --> 01:20:01,356
You can smile all day in a flygirl way
and say, ''Yeah, I'm that chick''

1325
01:20:01,406 --> 01:20:04,842
And maybe we can get the deejay
