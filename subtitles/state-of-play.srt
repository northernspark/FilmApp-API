(CAL SINGING) Oh, the night
that Paddy Murphy died

11
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,114
Is a night I'll never forget

12
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,283
Some of the boys
got loaded drunk

13
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,660
And they ain't got sober yet

14
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,204
As long as
a bottle was passed around

15
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,165
Every man was feeling gay

16
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,500
O'Leary came
with the bagpipes

17
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,085
Some music for to play

18
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,672
That's how they
showed their respect
for Paddy Murphy

19
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,758
That's how they showed
their honor and their pride

20
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,427
They said it was
a sin and shame

21
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,179
And they winked
at one another

22
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,014
And every drink in
the place was full

23
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,474
The night Pat Murphy died

24
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,565
As Mrs. Murphy sat
in the corner

25
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,275
Pouring out her grief

26
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,361
Kelly and his gang came
tearing down the street

27
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,197
They went into an empty room

28
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,865
And a bottle of whiskey stole

29
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,867
They put the bottle
with the corpse

30
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,535
To keep that whiskey cold

31
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,996
That's how they showed
their respect for...

32
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,999
They took the white
kid to the hospital.

33
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,709
He's in a coma.

34
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,463
Officer, you should
check in with the family.

35
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:41,178
Whatever you're selling,
I ain't buying.

36
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,304
Okay, guys, take off.

37
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,555
Yes, sir.

Coffee's free for

39
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,731
I heard Metro ballistics
was just here.

40
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,441
Who told you that?

41
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,193
You just did.

42
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,195
You got the names of
the victims for me?

43
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,821
You gotta be kidding me.

44
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,573
You know I'm gonna
find out anyway.

45
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,408
Not from me.

46
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,662
Okay. You want to play
a little confirm or deny?

47
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:10,082
I'm not playing this
game with you, Cal.

48
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,501
Look, Don, I got
a living to make,
all right?

00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,003

no quotes,
all right?

52
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,510
Okay.

53
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,303
Two victims,
one shooter?

54
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,596
Confirm.

55
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,431
One dead,
one in the hospital?

56
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,308
Confirm.

57
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,851
Drug related?

58
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,561
Confirm,
but deny later
if I have to.

59

Good morning.
WOMAN: Good morning, sir.

60
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,347
Okay, I'm late. I know.

61
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,848
I don't need to
be reminded of it.

62
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,892
I've been over
the briefing notes
1,000 times.

Yes?

64
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,062
Metro Police just called.

65
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,646
What?

66
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,110
Sonia Baker was
killed in an accident
on the Metro this morning.

67
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,114
They identified her
by her staff badge.

68
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,619
Horrible news
for all of us.

69
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,789
But, Stephen,
we're scheduled
to start now.

70
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,957

74
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,360
Talk to me
about this shooting.

75
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,778
You know,
one guy's still alive.

76
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,238
Deshaun Stagg?

77
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,823
No, he's dead.

78
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,491
The other guy on the bike,
Vernon Sando.

79
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,493
Hey, Gene, did you read
the guinea pig piece I filed?

80
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,619
Yeah, I'll get
to it, Ferris.

81
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,746
Because it's a great
human interest story.
Yeah, human interest.

82
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,914
So what's the deal?

83
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,959
Stagg's drug deal goes wrong,
and this guy just rides by?

84
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,460
Yeah, something like that,
I think.

85
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,795
That's a remarkable
feat of survival.

86
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,214
Well, at least it's
got a little bit of
a zip code to it.

87
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,590
Georgetown's the angle,
right?

88
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,468
No, no, the angle is
that this guy Vernon Sando

89
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,928
has got an MBA from Duke.

90
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,138
What's he doing on a bike?

91
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,389
He's buying
a pizza franchise.

92
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,932

they make you ride the bike

for the first six months,
learn the ropes.

94
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,894
He's got a wife,
two kids, mortgage,
total citizen.

95
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,312
What's his condition?

96
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,940
Critical, non-reactive.
Paragraph three.
He's in a coma.

97
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,609

outsourcing practices.

104

I've just received
some terrible news.

who was the lead researcher
for this committee

107

and a valued
member of my staff,
died this morning.

the tragic death was
initially,

and understandably,
one of shock,

127

yet questions immediately
began to surface

as soon as Ms. Baker's death
was announced.

as a purse snatcher.

kind of thing,

incident this morning

on the horizon?

00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,528
Yeah. Have you spoken
to him today?

150
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,948
Are you trying to make me
part of your story?

151
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,909
No. I'm trying to get
a little context.

152
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,911
Context, re: Dirt?

153
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,958
Well, do you think
he was having
an affair with that girl?

Gee, Della.

155

Yeah.

I'd have to read
a couple of blogs

before I could
form an opinion.

be worse for Collins.

He needs all the political
leverage he can get

into the Defense Department's

Okay?
Cal.

316
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,725
Now, Stephen,

317
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,270
you gotta be
proactive, okay?

318
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,898
If you're not,
then you're just letting
the bloodsuckers

319
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,025
and the bloggers
have another
free shot at you.

320
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,444
The bloodsuckers
and the bloggers.

321
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,946
Have you seen
the Globe's website
tonight?

322
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:00,990
No.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

324
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:18,966
Hello?

325
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,302
Miss Capitol Hill Blog?
It's Cal McAffrey.

326
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,511
Do you have a pen?

327
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,763
What?

328
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,514
Sonia Baker, right?

329
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,350
I have a source,
and you need to talk to him.

330
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,310
Well, why?

331
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,686
Do you have a pen?

332
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:31,938
Yeah.

333
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,108
Lieutenant Leon Comey.
Pen, pen, pen.

334
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,486
Write that down. C-O-M-E-Y.

335
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,571

He's gonna show you
an off-the-record preview

338
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,915
of the security camera tapes
from the Metro station.

339
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,875
What, you mean...
Do you mean, like, now?

340
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,961
Yeah, like now.
Sorry. Who am I calling?

341
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,088
I was trying to get
Della Frye the reporter.

342
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:00,049
Gee, I'm sorry.
I thought that I was
talking to the guy

343
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,634
who wouldn't give me
the time of day this morning.

344
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:06,806
Look,
I am just trying to help you
get a few facts in the mix

345
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,517
next time you decide
to upchuck online.

346
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,810
What?

347
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,894
(LINE DISCONNECTS)

348
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,858
I'm not doing it. I'm not.

349
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,743
DELLA: Wake up.

350
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,468
Does anybody know
where Room 514 is?

351
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,806
514A or 514B?

352
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,602
It doesn't say.
Is there a big
difference?

353
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:57,398
Big enough. You looking
for Uniform Squad
or Investigation?

354
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,652
I don't know.
Cal McAffrey sent me.

355
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,280
Why didn't you say so?

356
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,906
You Cal's new assistant?

357
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,992
No, I'm not.

358
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,161
Hey, can I see that?

359
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,332
Yeah, it's right
down the hallway here.

360
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,416
Thank you.

361
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,084
Like a police escort?

362
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,003
No, I'm okay.
Thank you.

363
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:22,173
Hey, no trouble.
I'm just grabbing
some dinner here real quick.

364
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,717
So, how long have
you known Cal?

365
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:25,926
Too long.

366
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,225
What's your title?
Okay, Sergeant,

367
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,935
I can file
a public records request

368
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,771
and get
the information anyway.

369
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,863
You got nothing?

370
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,448
No.

371
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,743
They've got 56 cameras
covering the track platforms.

372
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,245
There are three blind spots
in the entire system,

373
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,539
and Sonia Baker went
down in one of them.

374
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,333
You got copy for me, Cal?

375
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,627
The shooting delivery guy,
what are we doing?

376
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,753
I'm on it.

377
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,880
Well, I got Marty lined up
to take some
pictures of the family.

378
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,965
If you'd like,
I can send somebody
out there with him.

379
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,926
He can do the crying,
you can do
the nuts and bolts.

380
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,053
No. No need. I'm on it.
You'll have it tonight.

381
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,638
You're on it.

382
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,641
(EXHALING) Okay.
You know what you gotta do?

383
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,518
Call Leon, all right?

384
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,478
Just sort of push
him for the details.

385
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,021
Ask him a few more questions.
You know...

386
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:23,567
Nine suicides in 20 years.
There were five
accidental deaths,

387
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,985
three from people
trying to get their stuff

388
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,487
off the tracks
before the train came

389
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,073
and two of
the psycho-on-stranger
pushing attacks.

390
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,825
Did Collins sleep at
your place last night?

391
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,160
What?
Hmm?

392
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,665
I was just trying to
get my facts straight.

393

(PHONE RINGING)

394
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,168
Excuse me. Della here.

Yeah, just a sec.

Hang on, hang on, hang on.

It's Anne Collins.

398
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,853
Hey, I'm not at my
desk at the moment.
Can I call you back?

399
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,521
Yeah.

400
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,900
You know, look into
the two psycho-on-stranger
cases,

401
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,194
see if anything correlates
or anything connects.

402
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,279
Mmm-hmm.

00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,208
You okay?
No.

406
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,794
There are
paparazzi on my lawn,

407
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,548
so I guess that entitles me
to half off on Us Weekly.

408
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,718
I've been trying
to call you.

409
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,679
I had my phone off.

410
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,890
You talk to Stephen yet?

411
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,516
No.

412
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,521
They want me to come down
for a press conference.

413
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:46,108
Well, you know if you don't,
they're gonna toss
him on the bonfire.

414
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,861
You know,
I'm not that hurt.

415
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,654
I'm not even that surprised.

416
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,451

you know.

418
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,371
Tell me you
didn't know about her.

419
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,539
I didn't.

420
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,625
I did not know
about her, okay?

421
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,377
I'll take the train down.

422
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,506
Will you buy me
a drink after?

423
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,677
Of course. Hey,
just call him,
all right?

424
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,471
Just call Stephen.

425
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,306
Thanks.

426
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,611

00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,404
Be nice if they could
spell his name right.

428
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,031
No one's even come
to get his stuff yet.

429
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,699
It's appalling.

430
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,660
Never happen
to a white man.

431
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,703
Skip it.
I'm not in the mood.

What, no love,
no politics?

433
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,415
What are we gonna talk about?

434
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,125
We're not.
You gotta get out of here

435
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,961
before we both
get into trouble.

436
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,923
They're saying it
was only one shooter.
What do you think?

437
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,258
No idea.

438
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,719
What about drugs?

439
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,471
It's a good bet.

440
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,099
Come on, Cal,
leave that shit alone.

441

I'm just checking
out his cell phone.

(SIGHING) Watch, this will be
the moment they decide

443
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,065
to come and pick
all this shit up.

444
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,234
Then what are you gonna do?

445
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,486
Write some articles,
get me my job back?

446
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,154
You know I will.

Cal?

448
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,077
Cal, for Christ's sakes,
what do I tell Jack
if he walks in?

449
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,162
Nothing, 'cause I'm done.

450
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,460
I'll give you a hug
next time, all right?

00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:53,003
and the time you called,
I'll be sure to get
back to you. Thanks.

474
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,350
Hi. You've reached
Sonia Baker.

475
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,810
I can't take
your call right now,

476
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,353
but if you leave
your name, number,

477
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:12,523
and the time you called,
I'll be sure to get
back to you. Thanks.

478
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,698
Excuse me.

479
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,327
Sonia Baker.

480
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,913
We got any kind of
drug angle on her?

481
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,374
She ever arrested or rehabbed
or anything like that?

482
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,292
Who's asking?
Me.

483
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,795
You're not on the story.

484
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,797
I gave you
the Metro tapes idea, right?

485
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,674
Yeah.

486
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:43,137
So are you trying to ruin
what's left of
her reputation?

487
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,056
Are you doing
this for Collins?

488
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,142
A little context on Sonia?

489
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,187
You gotta be kidding.

490
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,908
Hey, Maurice.

491
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,369
Hey, Cal,
you getting your regular?

492
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,412
Yeah.

493
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,872
Sure. Hey, Jay!

494
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:15,294
I need a chili cheeseburger,
a chili cheese fry,
and a chili half-smoke.

495
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,212
I got the burger on!

496
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,507
Anybody get you yet?

497
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,934
All right.
You're a hungry man, eh?

498
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,019
Yeah.

499
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,645
How's it going, Happy?

500
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,295
That's a long way to
go for another soda.

501
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:04,593
You want to buy something
from the last bag
Deshaun ever stole?

502
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,553
I need 500 bucks.

503
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,240
Did you get the train okay?

504
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,491
What?

505
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,660
Did you get on
the train all right?

506
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,870
Get through.
Everything okay?

507
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,582
You're gonna
make small talk?

508
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:43,090
(CLEARING THROAT) I will go
check on the arrangements.

509
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,985
I'm sorry.

510
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,536
It doesn't have to be
a detailed statement.

511
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,581
Short and dignified,
and we'll be out of here.

512
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,417
Dignified. Got it.

513
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,927
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for
joining us here today.

514
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:32,180
Mr. And Mrs. Collins
would like to give you
a brief statement.

515
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,659
GIRL: Deshaun boosted
this metal briefcase

516
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:55,495
from some guy
outside of Starbucks.

517
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,582
That's what we did,
you know?

518
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:03,337
Grab a guy's bag and
sell it back to him.

519
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:12,220
Usually we just got,
like, people's business
papers and shit.

520
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,099
This one?
This one was different.

521
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,216
GIRL: There was a gun
in there, too,

522
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:53,261
and a little bag of these
weird-looking bullets.

523
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,139
Did you see the guy
that owned the bag?

524
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,683
No.

525
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,814
I told Deshaun
we shouldn't
sell this bag back.

526
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,149
I mean, you know,
what about the girl?

527
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,569
But he needed
a fix real bad,

528
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:14,199
and he and this
guy figured out
a time and place.

529
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,076
And that was it.

530
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,289
My boy never came back.

531
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,626
You took these out of
the briefcase first,

532
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,504
and then you called her
from Deshaun's phone.

533
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,589
Her number was there, too.

534
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,134
I figured someone
had to warn her

535
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,469
that this psycho was
following her around.

536
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,973
She just didn't pick up.

537
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,101
Mr. Collins moved to
staunch a growing tide

538
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,645
of hostility towards him
this afternoon

539
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,147
when he appeared
together with his...

540
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,732
...the long line of
politicians' wives.

541
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,526
We've had triumphs
and disappointments,

542
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,029
and we've both made mistakes
that have caused...

543
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:56,867
MAN: Apologize for
his affair and offer an
apology to his constituents.

544
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,326
Can you believe this?

545
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,162
We're on six channels
simultaneously.

546
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:03,040
CAL: Who might have
wanted Sonia dead?

547
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,792
What?
Is there something
in her history,

548
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,044
you know, something you
haven't told me about?

549
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:10,047
Some connections
that might have
got her in trouble?

550
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:13,884
No. No, no. Wait, who...

551
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:14,968
Am I talking to
my friend now,

552
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,136
or am I talking
to a reporter?

553
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,474
I gotta be both.

554
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,934
You ever heard of a guy
called Deshaun Stagg?

555
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,019
No.

556
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,687
Was a kid. Minor criminal.

557
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:29,483
Drug addict.
Got shot and killed
the night before Sonia died.

558
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,818
Cal,
Sonia didn't have anything
to do with drugs.

559
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,780
Look, Stephen,
I'm telling you things

560
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,865
that I haven't even
discussed with the paper.

561
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,909
Okay, you gotta
think about this.

562
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,994
Who might have
wanted Sonia dead?

563
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:01,348
CHRIS: Who is this man here
in all the photographs
where she's crying?

564
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,308
CAL: We don't know that yet.

565
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:08,271
And what was her background
before she started
working with Collins?

566
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,358
DELLA: Well, she has some
very random moments
in her résumé.

567
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,819
She was...
She waitressed
a couple times.

568
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,904
She had
a string of bad debts.

569
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,073
Shoplifting conviction
two years ago.

570
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:20,117
Don't they do
background checks
on the Hill?

571
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,202
DELLA: She wrote position
papers for Collins

572
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,329
about bank regulations
and the SEC.

573
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,331
I mean,
a lot of people thought
she was a star.

574
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:30,377
She was also
the lead researcher
on the PointCorp hearings.

575
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,295
CAMERON: So?

576
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:38,051
Stephen represents
the loss of a lot of
money for those guys.

577
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,140
Look, what if all of
this is just an attempt

578
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,016
to marginalize
Stephen Collins?

579
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,436
CAMERON: You've gotta love him
for it, haven't you?

580
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,731
I mean,
you give him 24 hours,
body in the alley,

581
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,483
and this geezer
will turn it into

582
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,277
a full-blown
corporate conspiracy.

583
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,486
You don't see
any connection?

584
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,779
No.

585
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,490
All right.
Let's go through
what we know, okay?

586
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,368
The guy that was
stalking Sonia Baker,

587
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,288
he shot Deshaun Stagg
and Vernon Sando.

588
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:11,626
Deshaun Stagg,
of no fixed abode,
he boosts a briefcase.

589
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,337
Now, in that briefcase
are these photographs,

590
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:18,425
and according to our source,
a little baggie
of weird bullets.

591
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:20,969
Metro PD ballistics tell me

592
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:24,806
the casings at
the crime scene were reloads,
untraceable.

593
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,978
The slugs were hand cast
at twice the weight of
store-bought bullets,

594
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,314
X'ed for expansion.

595
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,442
So that means
that the shooter
intended to kill.

596
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,945
Stagg and Sando were
both double-tapped,

597
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,656
one bullet in the spine,
one in the head.
That is the mark of a pro,

598
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,743
or at the very least,
somebody with
a military background,

599
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,828
perhaps even Special Forces.

600
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:53,376
PointCorp founded by,
staffed by 100% ex-military.

601
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,632
I think that's
a connection
we can't ignore.

602
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:05,347
Chris, how long before
we have to hand these over?

603
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,934
CHRIS: Time to verify,
consult relevant case files,

604
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,478
outside counsel,
48 hours, tops.

605
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,733
But if this is evidence,
don't they need
to see it now?

606
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,995
How's he doing?

607
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,766
Hey, you gonna let me know
if I gotta call
the ID team, right?

608
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,184
NURSE: I'll let you know.

609
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,901
Walter Schroyer,
Army buddy of your
libidinous friend,

610
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,237
gives his moving tribute
to Stephen Collins

611
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:05,323
in that asswipe
excuse of a paper
and not to us. Why?

612
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,702
CAL: Platitudes,
padding and fluff.

613
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,329
I'm a journalist.
I'm not a publicist.

614
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,747
CAMERON: I want to bring
some more people in

615
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,207
to work with
you on this, Cal,

616
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,252
on the political side,
people with real experience.

617
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,712
I'm thinking Ted Moody.

618
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,171
I mean,
Ted's perfect for this.

619
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,799
Are you taking me
off the story?

620
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:25,844
No, no.
Not off, just off point.

621
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,179
If this is as big as he
says it is, a big "if,"

622
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,557
then it's gonna
be good for you.

623
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,600
How? How is that good?

624
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,394
Well, watching
seasoned reporters

625

Don't let her do it.

And, Cal, if you're on this,
I want this to be
clean through and through.

630
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,448
Tell her to forget it.
It's your gig.

631
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,575
You got it. Get loud now.

Excuse me.
You're defending her now?

633

She's fine.
I can work with her.

634
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,623
But, Cal,
she's inexperienced.

635

Inexperience isn't fatal.

If I could just have
a few more days with it,

gonna let you down.

on the third floor ICU.

All right,

Access for what?

667

Vernon Sando, the pizza guy,
looks like he's coming around.

That's your side
of the story.

670

You heard me.

671

You want me to go
and sit around
in some hospital,

who looks like he might be
coming out of a coma,

while you clean up
the rest of the story?

that was all about in there?

It's not open
for interpretation.

It does not require opinion.

678
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,360
We got two dead bodies,
and we got a guy in a coma,

679
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,946
and we got us with a lead
that nobody else has got.

680
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,156
So you gotta make
a decision,

because I have to follow
another lead tonight,

682

and I cannot be in
two places at one time.

683
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,288
So, are you gonna
be okay slumming it

684
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,540
to find out if Vernon Sando's
coming around or not?

Good.

we gotta work together.

You knew exactly
what you had.

783
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:11,244
You just decided
that your need was
greater than ours,

784
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,954
and now you have
blood on your hands.

785
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,038
CAL: Hold on.

786
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,206
CAMERON: Detective, look.

787
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,917
The thesis that
we are pursuing

788
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:22,505
involves a certain company
that Congressman
Collins is investigating.

789
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,590
DONALD: What, this is
corporate conspiracies

790
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,676
that threaten
the highest levels?

791
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,012
All my years on the job,
I've only ever seen that
on TV.

792
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,391
All the years I've known you,
you've only ever
watched sports on TV.

793
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:37,562
CAMERON: So, Detective,
in exchange for
our cooperation,

794
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,273
can we be assured
that you will open
your books to us?

795
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,441
Quid pro quo?

796
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,823
If we decide to go
public with this,
we'll give you six hours,

797
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:50,032
but that's the end of it.

798
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,868
This is an open
homicide investigation.

799
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,619
You slow us down,
endanger the public

800
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,454
any more than
you already have,

801
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,747
it won't be pretty.

802
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,207
For the record,
I'm still not happy

803
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,667
the way you presented
the evidence.

804
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:02,461
I'm just gonna
put that out there.

805
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,550
CAMERON: Police gossip
being what it is,

806
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,510
I'm guessing that even
Entertainment Tonight

807
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:12,388
will know as much as we do
within 48 hours.

808
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,682
So we've gotta have
something solid today.

809
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:17,268
That means no assumptions,
no unnamed sources.

810
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:20,146
Not fast and loose.
I want this thing wrung out.

811
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:24,692
Damned if we can't
do a better job of it
than those cops.

812
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,112
Della, how are you?

813
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,072
I'm good.

814
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:31,824
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

815
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,200
Good, okay.

816
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,368
Well, you take
Sonia Baker, okay?

817
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,245
I want to know everything
that we can about her,

818
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,081
who she knew, who she blew,
the color of her knickers.

819
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,000
Got it.
PointCorp?

820
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,002
Okay. Hank and Pete,
you work with Cal.

821
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,503
Cool.

822
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,130
The rule on this
one is discretion.

823
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:50,509
This is not a good
subject for gossip over
drinks at the Monocle,

824
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:54,096
or spliffs in
the stationery
cupboard, you.

825
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,389
I'm offended, truly.

826
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:56,766
CAMERON: Well, be offended.

get your stuff,
bring it in here,

your new home.

829
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,688
Go on!

830
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,690
Okay! Yes, yes, yes.
Speed of light.

831
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:15,493
Cal? Any conflict
of interest here?

832
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:18,996
No.

833
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,917
SLATOFF: Perhaps this is
a good opportunity

834
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,794
to address another issue
that's been discussed

835
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:28,130
during these hearings,
your price structure.

836
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,549
Surely,
and I thank you
for giving me

837
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,052
an opportunity to
touch on that today.

838
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,222
Our price structure follows
the Defense Department model

839
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,766
as established in
the first Gulf War,

840
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:41,352
adjusted, of course,
for inflation.

841
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:44,855
Happily,
what's costing us so much
this time around

842
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,693
are some incredible advances
in on-field medical care.

843
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,778
But, simply,
we're now keeping more...

844
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,989
Sir, I'm sorry. Just...

845
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,324
When you were in the military,
did you see any combat duty?

846
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,909
No, sir, I did not.
No.

847
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,953
Do you think if you had,
you might see
things differently?

848
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,830
MAN: We're all aware
of your war record,
Congressman.

849
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,331
STEPHEN: I'm not talking
about my record.

850
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,918
I'm talking about the numerous
allegations of atrocities

851
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,088
committed by PointCorp
and its subsidiary
contractors

852
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,757
against
the civilian population
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

853
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,885
MAN: Those are
unsubstantiated allegations.

854
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,430
Okay.
This is straightforward.

855
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:21,017
Since a war on
terror was declared,

856
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:25,271
has your personal
net worth gone up
by more than $250 million?

857
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,903
Straightforward question.

858
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:36,032
Excuse me,
I was told that
personal financial data

859
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:39,035
would not be addressed
in open session.

860
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,453
Adapt.

861
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,623
Isn't that your slogan?

862
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,459
"Adapt and Achieve?"

863
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,004
It's on the brochure here.

864
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,799
"Commoda et Confice."
You have it in Latin.

865
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:55,551
MAN: Your point being?

866
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:57,803
Putting war in
the hands of mercenaries

867
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,056
and those who
consider it a business

868
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,391
is a contradiction in
terms in any language.

869
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,810
May I remind you,
sir, that the wars

870

this country fought,
that defined it,

871
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:10,399
were fought
despite what they cost,
not because of it.

No, I expect you didn't.

Well, especially from you.

875

The men who work
for PointCorp,

the men you dishonor by
calling them mercenaries

877
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:26,999
are, by and large,
retired American
military personnel.

isn't it?

00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:02,947
Nobody's got her yet.

937
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:06,200
She changed her
name a couple times
in the past year.

938
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,743
How'd you get it?

939
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:10,079
I had to agree
to go on not one,

940
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,498
but two dates with
a sweaty guy named Vic.

941
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:17,044
Don't even ask me.

942
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:18,504
Hey, Bob, it's Cal.

943
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,589
Want to run a Social
Security number for me?

944
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,097
(EXCLAIMS)

945
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:30,099
Rhonda Silver's number.

946
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,142
Did we just break the law?

947
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:34,270
Nope, that's what you call
damn fine reporting.

948
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,188
Your pen.
Keep it.

949
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:39,275
You're welcome!
Thank you!

950
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,238
Hi. Is Rhonda there, please?

951
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,241
I'm actually an old
friend of Rhonda's
from school.

952
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:51,245
I'm in town for the day,
and I thought maybe
I'd stop by and see her.

953
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,372
Do you think I could
show up at her work?

954
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:55,541
Would that be all right?

955
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:12,224
Actually, sir,
can I call you back?

956
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,311
That page and the next page.

957
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,689
HANK: This guy, Jerry Symes,
local politician,

958
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,482
he campaigns
against the expansion,

959
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,318
and then he dies in
a freak car accident.

960
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,570
CAL: All right,
what does "freak
car accident" mean?

961
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,488
Middle of the day...
He's driving on the
open road...

962
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,614
No witnesses.
...30 miles an hour...

963
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,116
Perfect weather,
no skid marks.
...car turns over.

964
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,994
And the police think
it might be sleep apnea.

965
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:35,080
Cal. Sorry,
I really need to talk to you.

966
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:38,834
What do you got?

967
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,336
So, I was looking
for images of Sonia

968
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,880
in the Metro security
footage, right?

969
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:47,801
And 20 seconds after
she went into the blind spot,
this guy appears.

970
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,720
Okay?

971
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:55,893
I think that I
saw him last night
at the hospital.

972
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,901
Are you sure?

973
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,541
Michael, it's Cal.

974
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:23,337
Your PointCorp insider,
I need to meet him, now.

975
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,411
I want you to know something.

976
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,162
I love my country.

977
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,372
I love the military.

978
00:56:58,498 --> 00:56:59,623
My aim here is to save them.

979
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:00,874
You understand my terms?

980
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,042
I will not give you my name.

981
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,586
I will not give you
my rank in the PointCorp
military structure,

982
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,380
or the in and out
dates of my service.

983
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,965
Understand.

984
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,051
CAL: I'm looking for
a guy that PointCorp

985
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,845
are using on
a covert operation.

986
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,263
Total deniability.

987
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,515
Our mutual friend
at DOD thought

988
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,851
you might be able
to help us find him.

989
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:22,855
I don't know.
I'll check it out.

990
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:28,777
So, what's your understanding
of the PointCorp MO?

991
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,279
Their MO?

992
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:32,072
They do whatever
the hell they want.

993
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,575
These soldiers are
answerable to no one.

994
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,785
They're loyal to nothing
but a paycheck.

995
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:39,538
It's the Muslim
terror gold rush.

996
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:41,790
You've been watching
these hearings?
Yeah.

997
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,293
So, the head of
the committee there,
Stephen Collins...

998
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:45,502
He's finished.

999
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,921
They'll just keep
knocking him down
until he goes away.

1000
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,840
Do you have any idea
what he's threatening here?

1001
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:53,010
This is $30 or $40
billion annually.

1002
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,720
That's wrath of God money.

1003
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:57,097
The hearings
are saying 3 or 4.

1004
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,683
Overseas. The real
money is what PointCorp

1005
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:02,352
stands to make in its
domestic operations.

1006
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,646
I wasn't aware
that they had any.

1007
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:08,901
Who was sent in
for crowd control
after Hurricane Katrina? Us.

1008
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,236
Private security
contractors deputized

1009
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:13,197
to shoot at
American citizens.

1010
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:17,326
Who's training
Chicago police on new
interrogation techniques?

1011
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:20,662
Soon, PointCorp will
take over from the NSA

1012
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:23,540
on phone taps,
terrorist databases,
all of it.

1013
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,168
It's a fundamental
restructuring

1014
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:28,337
of domestic
intelligence policy.

1015
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,965
It is the privatization
of Homeland Security.

1016
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,468
Billions and
billions of dollars.

1017
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:37,262
Now you really think
they're gonna
forfeit all that

1018
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,264
because some hero
from the seventh district

1019
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:41,350
of Pennsylvania thinks
that they should?

1020
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:42,434
Hey.

1021
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:47,064
CAL: I just got told
by a former
PointCorp employee

1022
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:49,775
that they have a plan
to monopolize
domestic security

1023
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,568
that's worth about
$40 billion a year.

1024
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,362
Is that true?

1025
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:55,239
STEPHEN: Yes.
CAL: How?

1026
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:57,866
You cannot connect anything
that I tell you back to me.

1027
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,117
You understand?
Of course.

1028
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,202
Okay.

1029
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:04,540
Last year, 47 companies
bid on major Homeland
Security contracts.

1030
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:07,251
Of those,
16 companies were
granted the bids.

1031
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:11,380
Of those,
I could make connections
between 14 companies,

1032
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,423
and I'm not
just talking about someone
leaving one company

1033
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,550
and go work for another.

1034
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,468
I'm talking about
shared banking practices.

1035
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:18,387
I'm talking about
collusive behavior.

1036
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,806
Now, my belief is,
when all's said and done

1037
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,267
and when
the veil is pulled away,

1038
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:26,478
you will not see 14
individual companies.

1039
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:30,983
You will see one company.
You understand?

1040
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,527
And you've been
digging around

1041
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:34,861
trying to make
those connections clear.

1042
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,780
Yeah. That's right.

1043
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,992
And Sonia was
working on that?

1044
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,952
She was my lead researcher.

1045
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,954
She was involved in
everything we did.

1046
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,623
They're gonna
get you, Stephen,
one way or another.

1047
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:50,252
They got 40
billion good reasons to want
you out of the way.

1048
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:51,712
You gotta go on the record.

1049
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,213
Swing the spotlight
back on them.

1050
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,799
You gotta
protect yourself, man.

1051
00:59:57,051 --> 01:00:00,721
You go out there
and find me evidence

1052
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:04,141
linking Sonia's
death to PointCorp.

1053
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:08,228
I will go on the record.

1054
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:10,689
I will shout this thing
from the rooftops.

1055
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,275
I can do that.

1056
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:20,907
All right.
I gotta get back.
I'll be in touch.

1057
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,909
Stephen.
Yeah?

1058
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:25,329
Just watch your back.

1059
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,205
You, too.

1060
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,216
Hi. Is Rhonda here?

1061
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,135
Yeah, she's just
right over there.

1062
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:41,928
(SINGING) Whoa

1063
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,264
I'm walking on sunshine

1064
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,308
Whoa

1065
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,977
I'm walking on sunshine

1066
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,687
Whoa

1067
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,773
And don't it feel good

1068
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:53,982
Yeah!

1069
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:57,569
DELLA: Cal, you're not gonna
believe what Sonia's old
roommate just told me.

1070
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:00,822
You're right.
I don't believe
a word of it.

1071
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,033
You got no corroboration,
no independent witness,

1072
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:05,202
and she obviously has
a financial motivation.

1073
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:07,287
We've got Sonia
Baker's roommate claiming

1074
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:09,331
she had a threesome
with Stephen Collins,

1075
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:10,499
and you want to ignore that?

1076
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,168
I am not saying ignore it.
I am saying consider it.

1077
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:15,170
Consider how it impacts
everything else we have,

1078
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:17,172
and consider that
she is full of shit!

1079
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:19,549
Yeah, but, Cal,
she's also saying

1080
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:23,011
that Stephen paid off
Sonia's $40,000
credit card debt.

1081
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,388
That is a story.

1082
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:26,306
Somebody's gonna put that
on the front page.

1083
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:29,101
Okay, is that
the right thing to do?

1084
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:32,521
Look, it's your half
of the story.
It's your scoop.

1085
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:35,273
Your decision.
Do whatever you want.

1086
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,786
ANNE: But I do know
that Stephen and I

1087
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,789
have been through
far too much together

1088
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:54,543
to make this one moment
the thing that
defines us forever.

1089
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:55,961

future...

1090
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:12,894
I tried to call.

1091
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:17,691
I mean, I actually
did call about 12 times,
but I hung up every time.

1092
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:21,236
Well, you know,
I'm glad you dropped by,

1093
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,823
'cause I've been
wanting to talk to you.

1094
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:30,996
Remember you
brought that girl
from Humboldt?

1095
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,456
Soleil,
or whatever her name was.

1096
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,623
Luna.

1097
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:36,334
Luna. That's right.

1098
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:40,088
And you two were
stoned the whole time.

1099
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,173
Yep.

1100
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,133
You managed to flip the boat,
and we lost everything.

1101
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:44,259
We had to walk
the rest of the way...

1102
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:45,427
We flipped the boat?

1103
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:46,595
You did.

1104
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:48,930
It was an adventure.

1105
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:51,183
That's what you kept saying.

1109
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,488
So...
So...

1110
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:07,783
I've been...
I wanted to ask...

1111
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,701
Sorry.
You first.

1112
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,497
I was wondering,

1113
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:21,004
do you think Stephen
could have pulled together
$40,000 without you knowing?

1114
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,214
What?

1115
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,465
Well, it's a story
that might break

1116
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:26,051
that basically
accuses Stephen
of doing something

1117
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:30,472
that would require
his having access
to a large amount of cash.

1118
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:33,391
I was just wondering,
could he do that?

1119
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,684
A story that might break?

1120
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,645
You mean something that
you're involved in?

1121
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:38,522
Indirectly.
What are you doing?

1122
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:41,358
I'm trying to help Stephen.
I'm trying to protect you.

1123
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,443

You always do this.

1126

Sometimes I feel like
we all made this deal,

1127
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:56,706
and it works out
great for you and Stephen,
and not for me.

1128
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,166
And instead of us
just figuring it out,

1129
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:02,462
you guys are just
fine walking around
as if nothing ever happened.

1130
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,344
Okay.

1131
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,891
Okay, let's start over.

1132
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:16,351
I come here to tell you
that I'm thinking

1133
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:17,769
about walking away
from my marriage,

1134
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,604
and you say what?

1135
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:23,942
I say it's too late.
We're way past this.

1137
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:28,196
Because you
wouldn't step up.

What do you mean?

1139
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:34,077
Not then, not now,
not in college.

1140
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:37,581
I'm saying that
you're asking me

1141
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,624
for something
that's not real.

1142
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,377
That's what I'm saying.

Annie...

1144
01:04:58,352 --> 01:05:00,896
We have two mortgages.

1145
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,148
We have the place
in Virginia.

1146
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:05,442
We've got
the apartment here.

1147
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:06,902
Basically, we spend
everything we make,

1148
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:10,780
so there's no way
Stephen could have
given anyone $40,000

1149
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,158
without me
knowing about it.

It's okay.

1151

at security trade shows.

01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:24,393
Except we didn't, did we?

1246
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:27,522
No, no, no, 'cause some wanker
decided it was beneath us.

1247
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:29,524
Look at her, come on!
Look at her!

1248
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:32,443
She's a sideshow!
It's a smear campaign.

1249
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,111
It's exactly what
these companies do

1250
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:35,863
to destroy people
who get in their way.

1251
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:39,742
The true story here,
the real story here,
is PointCorp.

1252
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:44,830
The real story is the sinking
of this bloody newspaper!

1253
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:47,625
Christ!

1254
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:52,380
(SIGHS)

1255
01:15:52,464 --> 01:15:54,882
We have new management
to answer to now, Cal,

1256
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:58,344
and they are
interested in sales,
not discretion.

1257
01:15:58,428 --> 01:16:00,888
And how am... How am I
gonna tell them that we are
now behind a story

1258
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:03,140
we were once in front of?

1259
01:16:04,851 --> 01:16:08,062
Well, we're running with
what we've got today.

1260
01:16:08,146 --> 01:16:09,814
No! No.

1261
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:13,276
You can't do that.
Why not?

1262
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,902
We've got more than
enough to go with.

1263
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:17,572
You run with it,
and you're gonna
frighten off the wildlife.

1264
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,156
And we haven't got
the rest of the story.

1265
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:22,660
I do not give a shit
about the rest of the story!

1266
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:27,665
We are going to
press tonight.

1267
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,750
You've got eight hours.

1268
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:33,963
WOMAN: You look tired.
Want some coffee?

1269
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:35,798
Yeah, that's nice.

1270
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:40,678
Can you hold on
for one second?

1271
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:43,306
George, a word with you
for a minute?

1272
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:45,224
Sure, Steve.
Thanks.

1273
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:47,768
Listen, I just wanted
you to know

1274
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:49,145
my speaking up
in the hearings
the other day

1275
01:16:49,229 --> 01:16:53,983
was not meant
in any way as a gesture
of disrespect to you

1276
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:58,571
or a lack of gratitude
for the support that you've
shown me.

1277
01:16:58,655 --> 01:16:59,780
No, no. Not at all.

1278
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:01,365
It was a very
impressive performance.

1279
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:03,784
You have your passions,
I understand that.

1280
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:06,871
All right, good. Well,
that's a relief to know.

1281
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:09,624
You have your show horses,
and you have your work horses.

1282
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:12,877
I'm sure we can all
find a way to get along.

1283
01:17:20,844 --> 01:17:22,428
There's no way.

1284
01:17:22,554 --> 01:17:24,180
There is no way we
can meet that deadline.

1285
01:17:24,264 --> 01:17:27,224
Yes, we can.
All right, guys, we're
getting our balls busted.

1286
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:29,310
What do you got?
All right, the guy
you had us check out,

1287
01:17:29,394 --> 01:17:31,520
Dominic Foy,
turns out he's a gold mine.

1288
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:32,647
CAL: Dominic?
Foy.

1289
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:35,441
Right.
He's a guy
I keep hearing about.

1290
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:38,653
A friend of Sonia's in all
the surveillance
photos where she's crying.

1291
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:42,281
And he's in
Rhonda's cell phone shots.
CAL: Mmm-hmm.

1292
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:43,366
Okay, so,
is this Halloween,

1293
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:45,159
or is he
some kind of freak?
PETE: Freak.

1294
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:46,535
He runs a legitimate
PR business.

1295
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:47,953
Handful of corporate clients.

1296
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:49,330
Just likes to party
on the weekends.

1297
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:51,332
PETE: Special parties.

1298
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:53,125
Tell him the good part.
Yeah,

1299
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:54,627
mostly works out
of the Daily Grill,

1300
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:56,170
but guess where his
registered office is?

1301
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:57,838
Where?
Guess.

1302
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:58,923
Where?

1303
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,091
HANK: The Watergate.

1304
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:03,260
Oh.
PETE: Not only that,
Suite 413.

1305
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:06,889
Same suite as the Medal
of Freedom Initiative,
which is...

1306
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:09,600
The lobbying
subsidiary of PointCorp.

1307
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:18,442
Let's get him on tape.

1308
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,027
PETE: You want me to
call Rodney and get the gear?

1309
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:21,278
Yeah, same place.

1310
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,114
What... I'm sorry.

1311
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,990
You want to
put him on tape?

1312
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:26,242
Yeah.

1313
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:29,245
What are we, cops now?

1314
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:31,372
That's totally illegal.

1315
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:35,167
If Dominic Foy can
connect Sonia Baker
to PointCorp,

1316
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:36,502
he's gonna be
under a lot of pressure

1317
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:38,546
to recant anything
he might tell us,
all right?

1318
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:40,506
So we put him on tape.
That's our insurance.

1319
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:42,717
And why do you think
he's even gonna talk to you?

1320
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:44,593
Because he's scared.

1321
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:46,262
How do you know?

1322
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:47,972
Because I'm gonna scare him.

1323
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:24,008
Hey, is that your
Cadillac out there?

1324
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:27,386
Yeah.

1325
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:31,682
V-8 XLR, 320 horsepower,
adaptive cruise control,
heads-up display?

1326
01:19:31,808 --> 01:19:34,185
That's the one.
That's a hell of
an impressive car.

1327
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:35,770
Yes, I know.

1328
01:19:37,147 --> 01:19:40,691
What do you got
in your gay-rage?

1329
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:44,612
Excuse me?
Your gay-rage.
Your garage.

1330
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:46,197
Right.
You drive
the same thing?

1331
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:50,451
No, I don't.
I have a 1990 Saab.
Oh.

1332
01:19:50,535 --> 01:19:54,371
Yeah. I got velour seats.
The passenger side
one's ripped,

1333
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,624
but it gets me
from A to B, you know.

1334
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:58,209
Sorry to hear that.

1335
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:01,212
If only I could get
a job in PR, right?

1336
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:06,467
Who the hell are you?

1337
01:20:06,551 --> 01:20:08,511
Do you read
the newspapers,
Dominic?

1338
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:10,346
Sometimes.
Okay.

1339
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:12,431
I got something I want
to run by you, all right?

1340
01:20:12,516 --> 01:20:14,850
It ain't finished.
I'm still working it up.

1341
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:17,353
Let's see how
you feel about this.

1342
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:20,564
"Dominic Foy, a D.C.
Public relations figure

1343
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:23,526
"with known ties
to defense contractor
PointCorp

1344
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,236
"was yesterday
linked to the death

1345
01:20:25,403 --> 01:20:27,029
"of Capitol Hill
staffer Sonia Baker."

1346
01:20:27,113 --> 01:20:29,365
Come on.
Are you a reporter?

1347
01:20:29,449 --> 01:20:32,076
This is not cool.
This is definitely not cool.

1348
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:33,953
Very unprofessional.
I'm just sitting here...

1349
01:20:34,037 --> 01:20:35,329
Cal McAffrey from the Globe.

1350
01:20:35,455 --> 01:20:36,789
Congratulations. Keep it.

1351
01:20:36,873 --> 01:20:38,999
That's gonna run
tomorrow unless

1352
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:40,417
you can tell me what
I need to know today.

1353
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:42,294
I don't think so.
I got a car out the back.

1354
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:44,505
I got a nice, safe place
where you and I can talk.

1355
01:20:44,589 --> 01:20:48,008
Hey, hey, Saab.
I don't know anything about
anything, all right?

1356
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,135
I'm a PR guy. Got it?

1357
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:52,012
Be that as it may,
there's two ways

1358
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:54,056
this article
can run, Dominic.

1359
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:57,476
Without your name
or with your name,

1360
01:20:57,561 --> 01:21:00,020
and maybe even
a photo from your website.

1361
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:03,649
Now, who knows who
that's gonna piss off
and how badly?

1362
01:21:03,733 --> 01:21:06,026
I'm trying to be
your friend, Dominic,
all right?

1363
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:09,905
I'd hate to see you
end up under a train
like Sonia Baker.

1364
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:13,534
And you promised never
to use my name, right?

1365
01:21:13,618 --> 01:21:14,869
Yes, I did.

1366
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:16,745
This place is nice?
It's classy?

1367
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,664
I'm gonna be
comfortable?
Uh-huh.

1368
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:39,643
DOMINIC: What kind
of dump is this?

1369
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:41,562
Where have you brought me?

1370
01:21:41,646 --> 01:21:43,188
No booze in the mini-bar.

1371
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:45,524
There's no
On Demand on the TV.

1372
01:21:45,775 --> 01:21:47,067
What kind of hotel is this?

1373
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:48,944
Little bit more of a motel,
I'd say, isn't it?

1374
01:21:49,029 --> 01:21:50,905
CAL: Nobody's gonna find
you here, Dominic.

1375
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:52,573
DOMINIC:
How are your beer-getting
skills, sweet pea?

1376
01:21:52,657 --> 01:21:54,992
You want to go get
Uncle Foy a nice frosty?

1377
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:56,869
I'll time you.
Christ.

1378
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:59,079
So, let's start
from the beginning.

1379
01:21:59,205 --> 01:22:01,332
Where did you
meet Sonia Baker?

1380
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,001
Why don't we start
with a little compensation?

1381
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:07,421
This guy's
stoned off his face,
and now he wants a beer.

1382
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:09,423
Can I have one?
Yeah.

1383
01:22:09,507 --> 01:22:11,258
What's he
taking exactly?

1384
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:14,553
Dude, downers.
This guy's losing his shit.

1385
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:18,223
For what? For what?
Me helping you out.

1386
01:22:18,308 --> 01:22:20,643
Me losing my business. Me...

1387
01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:22,770
This bed's disgusting.

1388
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:24,939
Compensate me, okay?

1389
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:28,943
Okay, so you want to be paid
to help solve Sonia's murder?

1390
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:30,903
(SIGHS) Save it, all right?
I'm in PR.

1391
01:22:30,987 --> 01:22:32,279
I know a little bit
about phrasing questions.

1392
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:33,822
Why don't you try
phrasing it like this?

1393
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:36,951
Would I like to be paid
for helping you
get a book deal?

1394
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:38,452
Nobody's here
for a book deal.

1395
01:22:38,536 --> 01:22:39,954
Really?
Everybody wants a book deal.

1396
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:42,289
And I'd like my cut, okay?
That's just fair.

1397
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:43,958
When did you meet Sonia?

1398
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:45,668
Compensation,
compensation.

1399
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:47,169
You came here
to talk, Dominic.

1400
01:22:47,253 --> 01:22:50,297
You know, mouse,
I'm the talent and I
don't like the vibe.

1401
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:52,716
So why don't you
change that up, okay?

1402
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:54,009
It's a non-smoking room.

1403
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:55,344
It's under your name.

1404
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:58,097
He's a douche.
I love this guy.

1405
01:22:58,181 --> 01:22:59,890
I want to call my lawyer.

1406
01:23:00,016 --> 01:23:01,725
I think you should
think that through.

1407
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,852
Can we get a signal
in this rat hole?

1408
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,397
Why don't you
think it through? Hmm?

1409
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:09,149
Dominic, let me just lay this
out for you one more time,

1410
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:10,484
because I don't
think you're getting it!

1411
01:23:10,568 --> 01:23:12,152
So I'll lay it out
for you! Okay?
Relax.

1412
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:14,655
I'll lay it out for
you nice and clear!

1413
01:23:14,739 --> 01:23:17,992
The newspaper can slant this
any which way they want to,

1414
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:21,161
and they can make you
the one and only
principal source.

1415
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,538
How do you think
that's gonna go down

1416
01:23:22,622 --> 01:23:24,164
with your friends
at PointCorp?
Not great.

1417
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:25,332
And anybody else
you're connected to?

1418
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:27,710
Don't do that.
Please don't do that.

1419
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:37,886
The more you talk,
the more you give us,

1420
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:41,056
the more protected you are.

1421
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:42,891
That's the way we work.

1422
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:47,771
And your compensation
is your anonymity,

1423
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,275
and that is all you're
gonna get from us.

1424
01:23:57,949 --> 01:23:59,825
Okay?
Yeah.

1425
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:02,119
Great.

1426
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:03,328
DELLA: Okay, how's
it going in here?

1427
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:05,372
Sounds frigging great.
We're just about ready.

1428
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:07,332
Let's do it.
DELLA: Great. Good.

1429
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:08,375
Come on.

1430
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:09,918
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm gonna open the door,

1431
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:11,211
and I'm gonna
let you say it.

1432
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:12,504
You have to talk to her.

1433
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:13,964
Cal is asking us to
push the deadline.

1434
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,382
We really can't
afford to keep doing

1435
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:16,717
this type of thing.
Where the hell are they?

1436
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:18,594
(EXCLAIMS) You saying that
as if I should know?

1437
01:24:18,678 --> 01:24:19,887
Yeah, well, you just
spoke to him.

1438
01:24:19,971 --> 01:24:21,555
Yeah, well,
they didn't tell
me where they were.

1439
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:22,806
$20,000 an hour.

1440
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,308
Yeah... All right!

1441
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:25,851
Bugger off!

1442
01:24:32,192 --> 01:24:33,192
Shit.

1443
01:24:36,446 --> 01:24:40,991
It was just this guy, okay,
that I knew from
the clubs, all right?

1444
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:43,327
And he worked
for a PR firm,
a very big one.

1445
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:45,370
Name?
And... No, I'm not gonna
give you his name.

1446
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:47,998
He's a friend, okay?
He had this, uh...

1447
01:24:48,124 --> 01:24:49,416
He had this...

1448
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:50,793
Well, the company
that he worked
for had a client,

1449
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:53,087
a very special client.
Name?

1450
01:24:53,671 --> 01:24:56,090
I'll give you that one.
PointCorp.

1451
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:58,342
And they wanted
a special employee.

1452
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:01,178
They needed a girl.

1453
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,890
I thought of Sonia.

1454
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,354
You got that?

1455
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:16,068
I'm sorry, are you saying
that Sonia was working
for PointCorp?

1456
01:25:16,194 --> 01:25:18,028
Like a steel trap,
this one.

1457
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:19,988
Don't lose her
to another paper.

1458
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:21,115
Yeah, that's
what I'm saying.

1459
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,033
Turn it up, turn it up.

1460
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:24,952
DOMINIC:
She was a perfect fit.
She had balls.

1461
01:25:25,036 --> 01:25:27,037
She was smart.
She was in debt.

1462
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:28,288
And she was
in debt, exactly. Yeah.

1463
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:31,291
They paid her
$26,000 a month.

1464
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:32,668
Whole hell of a lot
more than they gave me.

1465
01:25:32,752 --> 01:25:33,794
They paid me
a flat 20.
It's big.

1466
01:25:33,878 --> 01:25:35,295
Did they tell you
what the job was?

1467
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:37,214
No, they did not.
She told me what
it was, though.

1468
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:38,382
She told me about Collins.

1469
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:39,883
She told me
about spying on him.

1470
01:25:40,343 --> 01:25:43,137
And did they want Sonia
to sleep with Collins?

1471
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:45,472
No. She got on her
back all by herself

1472
01:25:45,598 --> 01:25:47,891
and screwed
everything up,
didn't she?

1473
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:50,477
How did they get her
onto Collins' staff?

1474
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:52,354
That I'm not gonna tell you.
You can forget it.

1475
01:25:52,438 --> 01:25:55,691
You can kidnap and torture
someone else for that toughie.

1476
01:25:55,775 --> 01:25:56,900
We have a deal.
Yeah.

1477
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:58,986
I've done my work.
Nobody's here
to screw you,

1478
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:02,698
but we need to know
who was working
this on the Hill.

1479
01:26:02,782 --> 01:26:04,032
Mmm-hmm.

1480
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:08,203
From the Hill, huh?
Well, from the Hill,
they found a guy to fix it.

1481
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:09,621
Name?
No.

1482
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:11,582
Who?
Leave it.

1483
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:12,833
Who?
Come on.

1484
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:14,084
What, are you
not hearing me?

1485
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:16,378
Forget it. I'd be
afraid to start that

1486
01:26:16,462 --> 01:26:18,922
sweet ass Caddy
every morning.

1487
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:21,842
I mean, keep in mind
if I was driving

1488
01:26:21,926 --> 01:26:23,427
that wheelbarrow
Saab of yours,

1489
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,054
I'd probably blow it up
myself with me in it.

1490
01:26:27,056 --> 01:26:30,475
You seen that thing?
It's like a lawnmower.

1491
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,853
I'm gonna get you
another beer.

1492
01:26:33,563 --> 01:26:34,813
Hey.

1493
01:26:35,565 --> 01:26:36,565
Oi.

1494
01:26:36,649 --> 01:26:39,151
Are you sleeping
with that guy?

1495
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,404
I mean, what are
you doing here?

1496
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:44,573
Are you sleeping
with him? Hmm?

1497
01:26:44,657 --> 01:26:47,159
Or you got a guy.
You got a guy, right?

1498
01:26:47,952 --> 01:26:49,286
DOMINIC: Donna?

1499
01:26:49,787 --> 01:26:51,371
DELLA: Della.
DOMINIC: Della.

1500
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:55,667
I got a guy.
Got a girl, too.

1501
01:26:56,127 --> 01:26:57,836
Right? I don't want
to leave anybody out.

1502
01:26:57,921 --> 01:27:00,005
Hey, Stephen.
How did you find Sonia?

1503
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:01,882
STEPHEN: What?

1504
01:27:01,966 --> 01:27:03,133
How did she come to
work in your office?

1505
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:04,801
Was somebody...
Did somebody recommend her?

1506
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:06,303
What are you talking about?

1507
01:27:06,429 --> 01:27:07,846
I think you've been played.

1508
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:08,889
Really?

1509
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:10,599
Who gave you her name?

1510
01:27:10,808 --> 01:27:12,559
What is this about?
Don't dick around about this,

1511
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:14,102
Stephen, all right?
Two questions.

1512
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:15,687
How the hell did she come
to work in your office,

1513
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:18,607
and the name of
the individual
who recommended her?

1514
01:27:21,444 --> 01:27:25,364
Fergus. George Fergus.

1515
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:28,992
Said she was the daughter
of an old family friend.

1516
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:33,705
Doug Sponder's
bachelor party.

1517
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:36,250
You remember that hotel,
the Americana?

1518
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:37,542
Yes.

1519
01:27:37,627 --> 01:27:42,130
Get here now, alone.
I'm in Room 408.

1520
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:47,427
I'll meet you
at the office.

1521
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:48,762
Stephen, we're
late already.

1522
01:27:48,846 --> 01:27:49,930
I'll call in.

1523
01:27:50,014 --> 01:27:51,682
Stephen, we are
late already.

1524
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:52,891
I'll call in.
Okay.

1525
01:27:56,145 --> 01:27:57,479
(SIGHS)

1526
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:03,902
Don't check
your voicemail.

1527
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:07,364
Cameron's going
on a rampage
about this deadline.

1528
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:08,782
So, did you cue it
where I asked?

1529
01:28:08,866 --> 01:28:10,200
HANK: Close enough.

1530
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,620
Okay. So, guys,
I'm gonna need you
to clear the room.

1531
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,539
That means you, too.
What?

1532
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:20,335
CAL: I got Stephen Collins
coming in here.

1533
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:22,004
It's gonna be a lot
more comfortable for him

1534
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:23,714
if you're not here,
all right?

1535
01:28:24,757 --> 01:28:25,882
Tell me you're kidding.

1536
01:28:28,177 --> 01:28:30,804
DELLA: Since when does
the subject of an
investigation

1537
01:28:30,888 --> 01:28:33,390
get his own private
preview of another
subject's interview?

1538
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:34,808
That's crazy!

1539
01:28:34,892 --> 01:28:36,893
You're polluting the story!

1540
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:38,395
Special circumstance.

1541
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:40,063
What? What?

1542
01:28:40,857 --> 01:28:43,150
Is it that he's a congressman,
or that he's your friend,

1543
01:28:43,234 --> 01:28:45,277
or that you have
a crush on his wife?

1544
01:28:45,361 --> 01:28:47,112
Could you
fill me in here?

1545
01:28:48,364 --> 01:28:49,406

country was founded.

1699
01:37:11,575 --> 01:37:14,202
And Sonia Baker's
mother's first name is?

1700
01:37:17,581 --> 01:37:21,793
Pardon me?
You heard me,
family friend.

1701
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:29,509
Do you really think
that your new owners,

1702
01:37:29,593 --> 01:37:31,052
these responsible
corporate citizens,

1703
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:35,974
are going to allow
you to publish this

1704
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:39,102
speculative drivel?

1705
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:42,021
You are gonna be
out of a job before

1706
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:46,734
the devil can even
say your name, son.

1707
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:51,865
Janine.

1708
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:57,662
Sonia's mother's
first name is Janine.

1709
01:38:17,016 --> 01:38:18,224
CAL: You're missing the point.

1710
01:38:18,309 --> 01:38:19,475
You didn't see his face.

1711
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:22,312
I saw his face. Fergus is
at the heart of this story.

1712
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:24,564
CAMERON:
This story is dead, Cal.

1713
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:27,984
One way or another,
PointCorp pushed

1714
01:38:28,068 --> 01:38:29,694
Sonia Baker in
front of that train.

1715
01:38:29,778 --> 01:38:31,404
Really? The trouble is,

1716
01:38:31,488 --> 01:38:34,407
our new corporate owners
won't let me print any of this

1717
01:38:34,491 --> 01:38:36,701
unless I have one
of the major players
on the record.

1718
01:38:36,785 --> 01:38:39,370
On the record, Cal!

1719
01:38:39,914 --> 01:38:41,789
And the only person
who could do that won't.

1720
01:38:41,874 --> 01:38:43,374
Would you like
to tell me why?

1721
01:38:43,459 --> 01:38:45,919
Or is it just that
you shagged his wife?

1722
01:38:54,053 --> 01:38:55,887
Maybe you'd like to
explain to me how, when

1723
01:38:55,971 --> 01:38:58,181
and why MediaCorp
chopped off your balls.

1724
01:38:59,183 --> 01:39:01,768
This is as big and as
connected as it gets.

1725
01:39:01,852 --> 01:39:04,604
You follow
any fissure of this,
it's a massive story.

1726
01:39:04,688 --> 01:39:06,856
You got Fergus,
you got PointCorp,

1727
01:39:07,024 --> 01:39:09,192
and now you got MediaCorp,
all connected,

1728
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:12,070
all in collusion,
all playing for
the same country club.

1729
01:39:12,863 --> 01:39:14,280
I didn't realize you'd
taken up the game.

1730
01:39:14,365 --> 01:39:18,993
Oh. Oh, Cal, if there's
any corruption involved here,
it's coming from you.

1731
01:39:19,078 --> 01:39:22,330
You have injected
yourself in this story
right from the beginning,

1732
01:39:22,414 --> 01:39:24,040
and we all know why.

1733
01:39:25,459 --> 01:39:27,794
It's over, Cal,
as far as you're concerned.

1734
01:39:27,878 --> 01:39:30,004
I can't protect you anymore.

1735
01:39:30,923 --> 01:39:33,758
And right now,
I'm not too sure
I'd want to.

1736
01:40:01,286 --> 01:40:02,996
You want the story?

1737
01:40:05,916 --> 01:40:08,584
Yeah. Come on.

1738
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:21,764
(CLEARS THROAT)

1739
01:40:23,934 --> 01:40:28,896
I was first introduced
to Sonia Baker

1740
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:33,943
in April of 2007.

1741
01:40:35,612 --> 01:40:38,823
She was hired
as a research assistant
on my staff.

1742
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:43,995
She was recommended
by the Majority Whip,

1743
01:40:44,955 --> 01:40:49,792
Congressman from
West Virginia,
George Fergus.

1744
01:40:51,628 --> 01:40:57,467
Three months into
her time there,
Sonia and I began

1745
01:40:59,636 --> 01:41:02,472
a romantic relationship.

1746
01:41:03,348 --> 01:41:08,728
STEPHEN: I have e-mailed
copies of documents to you,
which show beyond doubt

1747
01:41:09,063 --> 01:41:11,731
the corruption between
members of my own party.

1748
01:41:11,815 --> 01:41:17,070
I now know
that she had been placed
in my office as a spy.

1749
01:41:17,154 --> 01:41:19,280
PointCorp's tentacles reach
into every corner

1750
01:41:19,364 --> 01:41:21,240
of the ever-growing
private security industry,

1751
01:41:21,325 --> 01:41:22,825
both at home and abroad.

1752
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:24,368
Not only does
this pose a great...

1753
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:25,953
But it is
a violation of our laws.

1754
01:41:26,038 --> 01:41:27,080
A monopolistic business...

1755
01:41:27,164 --> 01:41:29,373
...obstruct and
otherwise destroy

1756
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,751
my investigation
into PointCorp.

1757
01:41:32,669 --> 01:41:35,922
Sonia was paid
to make regular reports
to PointCorp...

1758
01:41:36,006 --> 01:41:38,716
Left unchecked, I believe
that within five years,

1759
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:41,302
PointCorp will have
its own standing army
on US soil.

1760
01:41:41,386 --> 01:41:42,678
...into their
fraudulent practices...

1761
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:45,098
It will control our
intelligence-gathering
apparatus...

1762
01:41:45,182 --> 01:41:47,934
What happened in committee...
She had access to
everything we were doing

1763
01:41:48,018 --> 01:41:49,685
and effectively crippled
our investigation.

1764
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:53,731
It is a frightening vision
and one which must be stopped.

1765
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:59,153
However, when
my relationship with her grew,

1766
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:02,657
she ceased her spying
on their behalf,

1767
01:42:02,741 --> 01:42:05,576
and I believe
they killed her for it.

1768
01:42:08,705 --> 01:42:10,123
STEPHEN: For people like this,
who I've spent

1769
01:42:10,207 --> 01:42:13,167
the last year and a half
of my life investigating...

1770
01:42:13,252 --> 01:42:18,005
Innocent civilians are
really little more than
disposable lives,

1771
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:21,634
thought of as
collateral damage.

1772
01:42:23,053 --> 01:42:26,305
And I believe it was
simply the public nature
of my position that

1773
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:30,518
saved me
from a similar fate.

1774
01:42:33,647 --> 01:42:38,734
So, as political suicides go,

1775
01:42:40,028 --> 01:42:41,737
how was that?

Yeah.

probably have newsprint

Anyway, back to the story.

Yes.

1814
01:46:48,026 --> 01:46:50,486

Mmm-hmm.

He was a kind of a longhaired
hippie kind of guy.
Mmm-hmm.

01:46:55,367 --> 01:46:57,993
He had
a pen problem. Yeah.
Oh.

1817
01:46:58,495 --> 01:47:00,329
He solved it by
having a piece

1818
01:47:00,497 --> 01:47:02,289
of leather string
around his neck,

1819

he'd keep his pen.

01:50:30,665 --> 01:50:32,041
No.

1852
01:50:34,377 --> 01:50:37,546
I saved Robert Bingham's
life in Kuwait in '91.

1853
01:50:38,548 --> 01:50:40,799
He was a 17-year-old kid.

1854
01:50:40,925 --> 01:50:43,135
He was a good soldier.

1855
01:50:43,219 --> 01:50:45,387
He was proud
of what we did.

1856
01:50:46,222 --> 01:50:51,268
The Army was his life,
and he had problems
when he got discharged.

1857
01:50:51,394 --> 01:50:54,313
So you had a guy that
you knew to be unstable

1858
01:50:55,607 --> 01:50:58,651
do what, exactly?
Scare her?

1859
01:50:58,735 --> 01:51:00,027
Maybe beat her up
a little?

1860
01:51:00,111 --> 01:51:02,780
No, Cal.
I had him follow her.

1861
01:51:03,198 --> 01:51:04,156
Why?

1862
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:07,368
Because I knew
she was hiding
something from me.

1863
01:51:08,536 --> 01:51:09,828
Because when I'd...
I'd be at her house

1864
01:51:09,913 --> 01:51:11,664
and a fax would come in,
she'd get nervous.

1865
01:51:11,748 --> 01:51:14,333
Because there were
phone calls late at night.

1866
01:51:14,417 --> 01:51:16,168
I was suspicious.

1867
01:51:16,252 --> 01:51:19,963
I asked Bingham
to observe her
and report back to me.

1868
01:51:20,048 --> 01:51:22,132
That's all.

1869
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:24,635
You're a liar, Stephen.

1870
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:27,471
He was more upset
about what she was
doing than I was.

1871
01:51:27,555 --> 01:51:29,807
You have to understand
what the military
means to Bingham.

1872
01:51:29,891 --> 01:51:32,351
He hates PointCorp
for what they're
trying to do to it.

1873
01:51:32,435 --> 01:51:33,811
In his mind,
she just had to stop.

1874
01:51:33,937 --> 01:51:35,354
But she did stop,
right?

1875
01:51:35,438 --> 01:51:37,856
She tore up her paychecks,
and she put her life
at risk for you.

1876
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:40,067
Yes, but I didn't
know that.

1877
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:43,112
I didn't know that
he was gonna kill her.

1878
01:51:43,655 --> 01:51:45,364
I didn't know
he had killed her.

1879
01:51:45,448 --> 01:51:47,366
When I found out,
my thought was just
the same as yours.

1880
01:51:47,450 --> 01:51:49,284
I thought PointCorp
had done it.

1881
01:51:49,369 --> 01:51:50,369
And when you did
find out?

1882
01:51:50,453 --> 01:51:51,412
What was
I supposed to do?

1883
01:51:51,496 --> 01:51:53,163
Tell someone.
I tried.

1884
01:51:53,248 --> 01:51:54,373
When?
When I came
to your house,

1885
01:51:54,457 --> 01:51:55,666
and I wanted to
talk to you about it,

1886
01:51:55,792 --> 01:51:56,834
and all you cared
about was the story.

1887
01:51:56,918 --> 01:51:59,503
No, Stephen,
I cared about helping you.

1888
01:51:59,587 --> 01:52:01,463
Bullshit. Bullshit.

1889
01:52:01,548 --> 01:52:04,174
All you cared about was
clearing your conscience
over this little soap opera

1890
01:52:04,259 --> 01:52:05,968
you have with Annie.
So you used me.

1891
01:52:06,094 --> 01:52:07,428
No, Cal.
The same way
as you used Bingham.

1892
01:52:07,512 --> 01:52:09,388
I was suspicious of her.
I brought him in.

1893
01:52:09,514 --> 01:52:11,432
That's all it was!
It was a mistake!

1894
01:52:11,516 --> 01:52:12,641
It's my responsibility.

1895
01:52:12,809 --> 01:52:13,934
I should never
have done that.

1896
01:52:14,018 --> 01:52:16,145
But I never asked
him to kill her.

1897
01:52:16,312 --> 01:52:18,439
He owed you his life!

1898
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,401
That's why
you called him.

1899
01:52:23,153 --> 01:52:25,446
You called him,
and you used him,

1900
01:52:26,281 --> 01:52:28,699
like you've been
trying to use me.

1901
01:52:29,325 --> 01:52:32,578
One to kill,
and one to cover it up.

1902
01:52:32,829 --> 01:52:34,329
If PointCorp and
Fergus hadn't hired her,

1903
01:52:34,456 --> 01:52:36,540
none of this
would've happened!
No. This is not about Bingham

1904
01:52:36,624 --> 01:52:38,417
and PointCorp
and Fergus, man!

1905
01:52:38,501 --> 01:52:42,045
It's about you
and the decisions
that you have made

1906
01:52:42,130 --> 01:52:44,506
that have led to four
people being killed.

1907
01:52:45,842 --> 01:52:48,802
One of them was
delivering a pizza,
Stephen.

1908
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:54,349
Cal. What are
you gonna do?

1909
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:57,686
You know
what I'm gonna do.

1910
01:53:00,273 --> 01:53:05,194
You know, it's laughable,
your sense of
your own self-worth.

1911
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:08,739
Why is that?
'Cause nobody reads
the papers anymore?

1912
01:53:08,823 --> 01:53:10,616
Is that it?

1913
01:53:10,825 --> 01:53:13,327
It's just another story,
a couple days of shitstorm,

1914
01:53:13,411 --> 01:53:15,162
and it's wrapping paper?

1915
01:53:15,246 --> 01:53:17,247
You know, in the middle
of all this gossip
and speculation

1916
01:53:17,332 --> 01:53:18,457
that permeates
people's lives,

1917
01:53:18,541 --> 01:53:20,083
I still think
they know the difference

1918

between real news
and bullshit.

1919

someone cares enough

and print the truth.

Cal, don't do this.
Please.

01:53:31,054 --> 01:53:33,263
I'm asking you
as your friend.

1923
01:53:35,892 --> 01:53:39,269
You got about three minutes
before the cops get here.

1924
01:53:41,564 --> 01:53:44,274
I thought you said
you didn't call them.

1925
01:53:45,568 --> 01:53:46,735
I lied.
