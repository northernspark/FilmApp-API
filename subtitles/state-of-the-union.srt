2
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,907
Gin.

3
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,007
Gin!

4
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,346
Gin.

5
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,312
Here's the doc.

6
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,221
What's the verdict, Doc?

7
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,724
Can't last
another 24 hours.

8
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,818
Any chance of us making the
early edition? He'd want to.

9
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,658
What about some pictures,
last-moment stuff?

10
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,890
No.

11
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,895
Good afternoon, Miss
Thorndyke. Your father...

12
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,096
I heard your verdict,
Dr. Crane.

13
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:22,232
That's the daughter. She's
tougher than the old man.

14
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,941
Get out.
But, Mr. Thorndyke, I...

15
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:29,812
Out! Out, I say.
Stupid nurses, doctors.

16
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,407
Oh.

17
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,047
How are you feeling, Sam?

18
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:39,151
Oh, this blasted thing's
eating my guts away.

19
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,293
Did you see that editorial
in the Albany paper?

20
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,095
That fella won't take orders.
Fire him.

21
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,190
I did.

22
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,894
That's my girl.

23
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,361
The White House called
to ask about you.

24
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:52,995
He should call.

25
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,674
If those Republicans hadn't
knifed me,

26
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,835
he wouldn't be
in the White House.

27
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,606
I'd be dying there.

28
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,972
Well, well, well. What else?

29
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,243
Longstreet called.

30
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,308
Longstreet? That buzzard.

31
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,179
Made me an offer
for the papers.

32
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,285
Willing to keep my name
on the masthead, he says.

33
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:18,920
I'll keep it there, Sam. You don't
need Longstreet or anyone else.

34
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:25,334
Kay, I used to hate you
for being a girl.

35
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,465
I always wanted
a son like me.

36
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:31,769
But you're bigger
than any son.

37
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,703
A woman's body with
a man's brains.

38
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,378
My brains. Use them.

39
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:41,375
You'll make the White House,
Kay, one way or another.

40
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,713
The Republican Party
owe us that. Don't forget it.

41
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,849
I won't forget it.

42
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,586
That's my girl.

43
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,851
Men are weak,

44
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,057
vain, idealistic.

45
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,960
Can't stand pain.

46
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,029
Can't stand pain any longer...

47
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,973
Sam.
Women are the only realists.

48
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,509
Until they get sentimental. Don't
you ever get sentimental, Kay.

49
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,842
I never have.
Yeah.

50
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,142
Er...

51
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,386
Goodbye, girl.

52
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,520
I guess I'll call it a day.

53
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,556
You're the chief
from herein.

54
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,422
I'm gonna miss you, Sam.
Yeah, yeah.

55
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,561
You'll be all right.
You'll be all right.

56
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,130
Make those heads roll.

57
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,967
Make those heads roll.

58
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,908
Don't go in there.
But, Miss...

59
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,977
Oh, good heavens!
Oh, Doctor!

60
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,552
Doctor!

61
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,161
Call the police!

62
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,405
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

63
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,650
Fifty-one.
Oh, Doctor.

64
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,152
Lose your stomach,
Mr. MacManus?

65
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,688
Mr. Hawkins' office, please.
First door to your right.

66
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,054
Thank you.

67
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,753
Hi, Scylla.
Hi, Charybdis.

68
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,924
Well, if it isn't the
poor man's Drew Pearson.

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,661
Hey, new talent.

70
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,132
You better go in before
we have a new columnist.

71
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,536
Wait a minute. Who's in
there with the lion-tamer?

72
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,574
Team secret. Came in
through the fire escape.

73
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,075
Tailored?
Mmm-hmm.

74
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,906
Tailored politician?
Hmm.

75
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,538
Tailored Republican politician? What else?

76
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,445
Tailored worried
Republican politician?

77
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,381
All politicians are
worried today.

78
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,044
Jim Conover.
Announce me.

79
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,951
<i>Spike MacManus.
Send him in.</i>

80
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,892
If I had your number,
I'd call you and tell you

81
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,190
who's gonna be the next
President of the United States.

82
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,524
I know. Truman.

83
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:09,632
You want the walls to cave in
around here? I'll see you later.

84
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,766
Hello, boss.
Hello, Jim, what's cooking?

85
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,467
You'll be. If one word
of my being here gets out.

86
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,406
Hey, boss,
the freedom of the press.

87
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,207
If you must grace your column
with my name, it's Conover.

88
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,474
C-O-N-O-V-E-R.

89
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:26,006
You've spelt it "Canover", "Can
opener", everything but Conover.

90
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,984
Don't squawk, I haven't
spelt it "Conniver" yet.

91
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,420
Let's skip the jokes.

92
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,253
Jim, you know the Republican Convention
this year can end in a deadlock.

93
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,418
I don't know anything.

94
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,325
My uncle with the two heads does. Spike.

95
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,092
He tells me they're following
the usual Republican policy:

96
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,531
The Tafts, Deweys, Stassens,
and Vandenbergs

97
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,035
may knock each other out of the
running even before the Convention.

98
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,503
Thus providing a perfect
track for a dark horse.

99
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,800
Which leaves you,
Mr. Conover,

100
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,399
a fight manager looking for a
good heavyweight who can punch.

101
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,034
Jim, I think
I have your man.

102
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,544
Yeah, you
and everybody else.

103
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,275
This is Kay Thorndyke,
not everybody else.

104
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,850
I'm sorry, Kay, it's just that you
have to show me. I'm from Missouri.

105
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,978
Ha!

106
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,386
If you were from Missouri,
you'd have a job in Washington.

107
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,754
Lay off, Spike.

108
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,921
All right, let's have it, Kay.
Who's your man?

109
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,791
ltem one: born in Nevada.

110
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,524
But there's never been
a western president.

111
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,327
There are Americans
out there, too.

112
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,369
Item two: self-made, sold newspapers,
worked his way through school.

113
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,668
Item three: good war record.
Partisaned Lafayette Escadrille WWI,

114
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,731
decorated by three
governments. Ancient history.

115
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,004
Item four: started the
two-by-four airplane factory

116
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,409
and ran it into the biggest
thing in aviation today.

117
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,206
Look at me
when I'm talking to you.

118
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,083
First industrialist to introduce
labor-management plant administration.

119
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,018
He's never even been
threatened with a strike.

120
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:39,023
He'd have labor in one pocket, big
business in the other. Are you interested?

121
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,525
No. What's Horatio Alger
look like?

122
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,994
Women have been crazy about him all
his life, if that's what you mean.

123
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,655
Well, that lets me out.

124
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,423
And men?

125
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,558
Part owner of a ball club.

126
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,760
Ever run for office?

127
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,064
Not even for dog catcher.

128
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,161
Hates politics.

129
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,229
Then what's given him
this presidential yen?

130
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,068
Oh, he hasn't got it yet.

131
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,037
You're going to
give him that.

132
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,078
On the newsstands tomorrow.

133
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:04,182
<i>"Our planes have wings
but not our ideas."</i>

134
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,275
You could make him
the next president, Jim.

135
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,910
Kay, I'm not terribly impressed.
I never am by amateurs.

136
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,149
But if you and Grant Matthews
happen to be in Washington,

137
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,124
and knock on my door
to get out of the rain...

138
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,751
But I have been trying to
make this clear all afternoon.

139
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,763
I don't want to be President
of the United States.

140
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,063
Guess the job isn't
big enough for him, boss.

141
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,069
President. Holy smoke.

142
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,731
Why, when I was a kid, my
dad took me on a two-day trip

143
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,536
just to look at
President Taft.

144
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,839
On a clear day you could see him
for a couple of hundred miles.

145
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,242
Yeah,
you sure could.

146
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,940
After he passed, my father
slapped me right across the face.

147
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,642
When I asked him
what that was for, he said,

148
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,710
<i>"Just so you'll never forget the day you
saw the President of the United States."</i>

149
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:45,351
Well, Mr. Conover, I've listened to
some pretty tall reasons around here

150
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,857
why I could
run for president.

151
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,793
Self-made man, friend of labor,
dark horse and all that stuff.

152
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,727
All very flattering,
I might add.

153
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:55,130
But, could I ask you, a professional
politician, to give me one good reason

154
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:59,968
why me, Grant Matthews, should run for
the biggest and the best job in the world

155
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,803
when there are 10,000
other men... Wait a minute.

156
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:06,367
Let's understand each other. I'm not
telling you you should be President.

157
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,912
I was under the impression that
Kay Thorndyke brought you down here

158
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,846
to sell me on the idea,
not for me to sell you.

159
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,943
Now let's not get childish, nobody's
trying to sell anybody anything.

160
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,784
Kay, the man doesn't want the
job, and hundreds of others do.

161
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,551
We're wasting our time.
That's right, Kay.

162
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,023
He's right.
We're wasting his time.

163
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,720
I'm not interested
in politics or politicians.

164
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,422
And I don't
like airplanes.

165
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,995
That makes us even.

166
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,623
Although I could get
to like you, Mr. Conover.

167
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:33,104
Mr. Matthews, it's no skin off my
nose, but just for my private files,

168
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,600
you made a speech in Cleveland that hit
the front pages all over the country.

169
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,803
<i>Even the New York Times
with that stuff about,</i>

170
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,073
<i>"Either we pull together
or get pulled apart."</i>

171
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,842
Every Republican leader
wishes he'd made it.

172
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,907
So? I'm trying to get
it through my lame brain,

173
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,880
if you have no interest in politics,
why did you make that speech?

174
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,253
Oh, now, wait a minute. I can
be interested in the country

175
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,757
without being interested
in politics.

176
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,656
That'll surprise Jim Conover.

177
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,560
I don't care
who it surprises.

178
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,995
Don't get the idea that I'm not
interested in what's going on.

179
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,692
I like this country,
Mr. Conover.

180
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,393
It's been darn good to me.

181
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,629
I started with a screwdriver
and a monkey wrench

182
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:08,196
and two years of high school,
and built the Matthews Aircraft.

183
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,166
Did you ever fly an airplane? Oh,
no, you don't like airplanes, do you?

184
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:15,611
You better not elect me President
then, because I'd make it a law

185
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,377
for every politician to spend
at least 100 hours in the air.

186
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,147
This year, most of us are
up in the air all the time.

187
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:25,145
Well, the next time you're up
there, Mr. Conover, look down.

188
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,058
Look down on Pittsburgh,
for example, what do you see?

189
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,756
Smoke. That's right,
smoke. From the steel mills.

190
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,096
Miles and miles of
steel mills.

191
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,634
But you see something else, too, don't you?

192
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:43,240
Farms, factories, lumber, mines,
railroads, business, management, labor.

193
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,437
Not one able to exist alone,
but together, working together

194
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,878
with courage and imagination.
That makes America.

195
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,007
That's a great picture
from the air.

196
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,742
Yeah, but come down to earth and
walk into one of those meetings

197
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,618
like that one in Cleveland,
and what do you find?

198
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:02,021
Farmers, cattlemen, lumbermen,
business, labor, they were all there.

199
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,429
All working together?
In a pig's eye.

200
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,890
All scared to death,
all fighting each other.

201
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,761
Each out for the biggest bite
in the apple.

202
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,138
Well, there aren't
that many bites in the apple.

203
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,035
That's what I was
talking about in Cleveland

204
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,407
and that's why I'm surprised
that you asked me here.

205
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:20,671
Why surprised?

206
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:21,906
Because you politicians,

207
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,471
instead of pulling
the country together

208
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,211
are helping pull it apart,
just to get votes.

209
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,753
To labor, you promise
higher wages and lower prices.

210
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,688
To business,
higher prices and lower wages.

211
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:35,525
<i>To the rich, you say, "Let's cut
taxes". To the poor, "Soak the rich".</i>

212
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,186
To the veterans,
cheaper housing.

213
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,697
To the builders,
uncontrolled prices.

214
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,262
There's no halo
around my head, Mr. Conover,

215
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:45,132
but that's what keeps
men like me out of politics.

216
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:46,898
Hurray!

217
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,275
You didn't ask me to
make this speech, did you?

218
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,867
You just asked me what I said.
Let that be a lesson to you.

219
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:56,312
Mr. Matthews, you've just created
the ideal political platform.

220
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,746
Drown the politicians.

221
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,079
Very funny.

222
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,512
Mr. Matthews, now, if you
really believe those things

223
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,419
and weren't just spouting
to hear yourself talk,

224
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,856
you've just given yourself
several reasons to run.

225
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,416
That's my whole point.

226
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,361
The only way to correct those
evils is to get into politics.

227
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,728
Get into the White House where
you can do something about it.

228
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,097
But, Kay, you just don't
get into the White House,

229
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,635
millions of people
have to vote for you.

230
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,733
You're not afraid of the job,
are you?

231
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,602
What do you mean, I'm afraid?
Of course I'm not afraid

232
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,574
I'd make
a darn good president.

233
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,605
What am I saying?
You've got me doing it now.

234
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,511
I would like to
pause at this moment

235
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,607
and take a one-man
Gallup poll.

236
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,845
What chance do you think Mr.
Matthews here really might have, Jim?

237
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,356
I don't know. Any native-born
American over 35 has a chance.

238
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,483
Jim, on Tuesday Grant
starts a tour of his plants.

239
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,584
Everywhere he's going
he's been invited to speak.

240
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,492
Wait a minute. I'm going to be
pretty busy, you know.

241
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,588
I've got problems
in all those plants.

242
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,667
Grant, you've got to go along
with us that far. Try it out.

243
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,464
At least you get
a few things off your chest.

244
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,936
Spike, you're going
along with him.

245
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,098
You've been telling everyone
for years how to run a campaign.

246
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,573
Now we'll see
if you can really run one.

247
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,907
Fine, I'll go over to the White House
and tell the Trumans to start packing.

248
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,246
Yes, Norah, what is it?

249
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,415
Norah!

250
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,192
Do you know a man named Mac? Mac who?

251
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,490
<i>He's calling from New York.
He just said to say, "Mac."</i>

252
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:17,688
Oh, Mac.

253
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,796
Hello? Yes, I've been
waiting to hear from you.

254
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:27,464
Oh? Oh, wait a minute. I'll
take this call in another room.

255
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,905
I'll hang up
as soon as you're on.

256
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,100
Do you mind?

257
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,666
Might get a little
Drew Pearson blood.

258
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,575
I thought it was agreed
we'd all trust each other.

259
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,546
Only when we're
in the same room.

260
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:36,939
Jim, I've been
waiting for you...

261
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,813
Just a minute, Congressman.
I've got a call to answer.

262
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,778
I don't get this. If he's
really serious about me

263
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,151
as a possible candidate,

264
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,087
the Republican Party
must be pretty desperate.

265
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,250
The party isn't desperate,
just Conover.

266
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,817
If he doesn't personally select
the Republican candidate this year,

267
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:53,661
he may as well turn, if you'll
pardon the expression, Democrat.

268
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,733
Are you on?
All right, I'll hang up.

269
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,569
Kay, put that down.
Wait a minute, what?

270
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,844
They've had someone
looking you up.

271
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,436
They picked up some gossip
about you and me.

272
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,640
Uh-oh.
No.

273
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,883
There's been some talk about
Mary. Mary and some major.

274
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,183
Who's Mary?
Mrs. Matthews.

275
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,656
Oh!

276
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:22,193
A major? What's his name?
I can't...

277
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,558
What does it sound like?

278
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,455
A major!

279
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,464
Did you see what that so
and so wrote about me today?

280
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,797
Well, isn't it true?

281
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,570
Hey, it's 5:00 already.

282
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,801
Spike, you may have trouble
finding a taxi at this hour.

283
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,468
If you want to talk privately,
why don't you say so?

284
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,704
I just did.

285
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:43,008
Mr. Matthews, you and I might
take time to finish our drinks.

286
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,709
Do you mind,
Miss Thorndyke?

287
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,377
Jim, I want you to know that
Grant and I trust you implicitly.

288
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,613
Thank you.

289
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,347
I'm very happy about this,
Grant. Miss Thorndyke.

290
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,551
You might as well wait, too. That's
what I was going to talk about.

291
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,257
Close the door, Spike.

292
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,859
Do you mind being seated?

293
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:07,332
Naturally, Mr. Matthews, when your name
first came up, I made some enquiries.

294
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,703
It seems there's been
some talk about you two.

295
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:13,404
There's been that kind of gossip about
every candidate except Herbert Hoover.

296
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,175
They didn't pull it on Hoover
'cause nobody would've believed it.

297
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:22,352
There are no grounds for talk. Mr. Matthews
and I are very good friends. Period.

298
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:25,990
You see, Mr. Matthews, while Miss
Thorndyke happens to be single,

299
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,150
you are a married man,
with two children.

300
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:32,323
If you consider that
a major... A vital factor.

301
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,597
I guess that ends it.

302
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,498
What's the answer, Jim?
It isn't my problem.

303
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,866
But if it were, you two wouldn't
be seen together from now on.

304
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,566
Now wait... You can't get to first
base against a whispering campaign.

305
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,301
Could I get a word in here?

306
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,538
Perhaps Kay's friendship means more
to me than all this political...

307
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,443
That's all I wanted
to hear, Grant.

308
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,948
Jim's right. We don't see
each other from now on.

309
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,381
I knew she'd feel
that way about it,

310
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,442
and I'm sure she'll agree
with me on the next step.

311
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,954
I think Mrs. Matthews should
be down here with her husband.

312
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,456
And I'd like to see her make
this trip with him. Now, Jim.

313
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,186
Brother Conover,
that does it.

314
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,923
You have just ended the shortest
political campaign on record.

315
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,530
If my wife knew that
I was even thinking of myself

316
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:11,160
as President of these United
States, you just don't know my wife.

317
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:14,034
She'd call me Nappy every
other minute. "Nappy"?

318
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,968
Nappy. That's short
for Napoleon.

319
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,872
That's what she calls me when I get
a little too big for my britches,

320
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,412
which is quite often.
I know what Grant means.

321
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,175
The world is full of wives
who devote their time

322
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:24,408
to clipping
their husbands' wings.

323
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,610
Now Kay, that isn't
quite fair to Mary.

324
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,916
Mr. Conover, I don't want you to get
the wrong impression about my wife.

325
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,083
She's a very attractive woman
and a very bright one.

326
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,093
It's just, you know, a man can
just take so much criticism.

327
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,160
If you become a candidate, you'll
have to take a lot of criticism.

328
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:42,359
Yeah. Your wife might be good
training for you. Toughen you up.

329
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,499
We've got to kill
this gossip, Mr. Matthews.

330
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,597
The American people want to see a
candidate and his wife campaign together.

331
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,939
It's an American tradition. Otherwise
you can forget the whole thing.

332
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,002
I warned you I had
no talent for politics.

333
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,843
I wouldn't think of using
my wife as a smoke screen.

334
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:00,248
Would she have to know? In
answer to your question, yes.

335
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,743
That's what I said.

336
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,286
You know, I haven't quite
made up my mind about you.

337
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,360
Mr. Conover, I'm going to
tell you something.

338
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,423
As things now stand,
I'm not too sure

339
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,469
that my wife would go out
and have dinner with me,

340
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,629
much less
make a trip like this.

341
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:24,842
But I still say, I would've
made a darn good president.

342
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,584
Shall we dance?

343
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,619
Now what?
Senator Fosdick is here.

344
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,391
Ex-Senator Fosdick. Blast, what
does that lame-duck want now?

345
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:48,923
Lame? The last election
broke both his wings.

346
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,992
Put him somewhere. He may
get elected again sometime.

347
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,095
My room's the only one
that's not full up.

348
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,434
I can be out of mine
in 20 minutes.

349
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,134
No, no, no. Give him a drink,
we'll get him settled later.

350
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,401
Politicians seem to think

351
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,604
there's a law against
paying hotel bills.

352
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,613
Getting back to your wife,
Mr. Matthews, she's over 21.

353
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,343
Don't you think the fairest thing
would be to let her decide herself?

354
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,851
Grant knows what's fair
and what isn't.

355
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,447
Besides, he has a much more
important call to make. Remember?

356
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,551
My boy's birthday! I should've
phoned long ago. May I use that?

357
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:15,718
Please.
Thank you.

358
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,194
What's the number here? District
6530. Use the private phone.

359
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,457
This one?
That's right.

360
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,427
This is district 6530.

361
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,263
I'm calling Greatwood,
Long Island.

362
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,337
Yeah, the number is 247.
Please.

363
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,371
The little guy
is eight today.

364
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,009
You'll talk to Mary, Grant.

365
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,471
You want me to?

366
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,108
I want anything that will
get you where you belong.

367
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,812
Invite her to stay here,
of course.

368
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,785
No way for a fellow
to be elected president

369
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,825
without his wife
knowing about it, is there?

370
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,884
Hello? Hello, Swenson.
Hello, Buck, how are you?

371
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,753
Put Mrs. Matthews on.

372
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:55,489
What's all the noise?
Oh, the birthday party.

373
00:18:57,035 --> 00:19:00,835
Hello? Hello, Joyce!
How are you, sweetheart?

374
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,233
It's my daughter, she's 10.

375
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,467
Hmm.

376
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,744
Hello, Butch, is that
you, son? How are you?

377
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,545
Happy birthday!

378
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,847
Well, uh,
I can't sing it now.

379
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:21,523
Yeah, Butch. Hello?
Hello, Mary.

380
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,086
Mary, could you get the kids
off the other phone?

381
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,528
Mary, I can't sing it here.
Yeah.

382
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,797
Now don't call me Nappy.

383
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,599
No...

384
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,233
Okay, okay. You'll love this.

385
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,244
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

386
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,548
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

387
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,881
Truman's gonna get
the musical vote.

388
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,653
<i>Happy birthday, dear Grant</i>

389
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,687
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

390
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,127
Flat? I was not flat.

391
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:02,397
Look, Mary,
I'm here in Washington, D.C.,

392
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,367
and I'm going to make
a tour of the plants.

393
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,529
Hello, Butch...

394
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:10,835
Look, Mary, Mary, it's a
little too tough over the phone.

395
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,935
Could you come down here,
do you suppose? Yeah.

396
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,980
We'll stay with Jim Conover.

397
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,044
Conover!

398
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,310
He's a sort of a ham.

399
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,785
I'll send you the address,
Mary...

400
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:27,022
Mary, come please, will you?
All right, dear.

401
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,993
Yes, yes, Butch.
Yeah, yeah, I know.

402
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,094
Yes, Joyce. Goodbye, sweetheart. Goodbye.

403
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,196
She's coming?

404
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,766
Yes, yes, heaven help me.

405
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,407
And when she gets here, she's
to be told the whole story.

406
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:46,069
If she decides to change
her mind and go back home,

407
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,540
nobody is to
interfere with her.

408
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,945
Is that understood?
Funny world.

409
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,078
I want you to be President,
so I go back to New York

410
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:54,618
and you tour the country
with your wife.

411
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,779
Politics make
strange bedfellows.

412
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,258
Come in.

413
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,692
Hello, Grant.

414
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,667
How's the people's choice?

415
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,042
This fantastic notion had me
thinking about myself so much,

416
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,413
I forgot there were others.

417
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:28,214
Just talking home on the phone
did that to you?

418
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,687
Mary and the kids can't be dismissed
with a wave of the mind, Kay.

419
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,958
Still dragging around some of those
little chains, aren't you, Grant?

420
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,655
What chains? Those little
chains of middle-class morality

421
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,560
that've kept big men down,
all through the ages.

422
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:43,362
Nothing's dragging me down. I just
want everything out in the open.

423
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:47,030
No more hiding in the dark. No more
playing both ends against the middle.

424
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:50,097
And no White House.
No, Kay, no White House.

425
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,739
Sounded like a pipe dream,
anyway.

426
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,904
No pipe dream to me, Grant.
I believe in you.

427
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:00,913
I know you do, Kay.

428
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,552
And I know just what
you've meant to me.

429
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,355
But...
But, sit down.

430
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,691
Look, Grant.
Don't you suppose I knew

431
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:15,426
what was going to happen to
me if you ran for president?

432
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,263
Don't you suppose I knew
there had to be a Mary

433
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,133
if there was going to be
any White House?

434
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,831
Your knowing it
doesn't make it easier.

435
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,567
Have I asked for it
any easier?

436
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,768
I'm the corner of this triangle
that'll take the beating.

437
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,835
I'm not going to let you take
that beating. Yes, you are!

438
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,248
Go after the biggest
and the best there is.

439
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,181
You'll make
a great president.

440
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,644
And if somebody suffers,
if I suffer, so what?

441
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,685
<i>As my father used to say, "Life is
war, don't count the casualties."</i>

442
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:46,961
Look, Grant, I think I know
you. And I know I love you.

443
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,867
If you're in the White House,
I'll be in the White House,

444
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,062
whether I'm in New York
or on the Moon.

445
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,332
You're a great gal, Kay.

446
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:58,569
Come in.

447
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:03,244
Oh? Conference? I'll be back.
No, no, no, come on in, Jim.

448
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,583
I think I'll go down and inspect
the plumbing at the White House.

449
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,050
I'll see you later.

450
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,021
There's a mighty big man, Jim. Yes.

451
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,580
Mighty big man,
with a mighty small chance.

452
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:14,716
Oh?

453
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,956
Kay, do you mind if I let
my hair down? It's your hair.

454
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,395
Look, with no Roosevelt
to run against,

455
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,365
it's green pastures again
for Republicans.

456
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,198
So I dig up enough money to
rent this house for two years

457
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,431
and think I'll angle myself
back into politics.

458
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:31,306
Do I get a bid from Dewey, Taft, Vandenberg,
and Stassen to manage their campaigns?

459
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,638
I do not.

460
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,269
Harding-gang stink
is still on me, they say.

461
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:38,111
So this house becomes a boarding
house for political has-beens

462
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,673
who can't get on
any bandwagon,

463
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,480
and you come along with
your airplane builder.

464
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:43,145
And me, the best political
brain in this country

465
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,381
outside of Jim Farley,

466
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:47,118
I'm now nursing a rank amateur
like Grant Matthews.

467
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:50,218
A mixed up guy who sees ideals out of
one eye and ambition out of the other.

468
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,422
A guy who hates politicians,
you heard him.

469
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,929
A guy with a busted-up home
that'll be poison at the polls.

470
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,058
Jim.

471
00:23:56,868 --> 00:24:00,065
Wouldn't you like to become
Chairman in the Republican Party?

472
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,833
I'd give my right arm
up to here

473
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,807
to become Chairman of
the Republican...

474
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,706
Say, are you making
commitments for him?

475
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,371
Get that hair back up again.
What's the matter with you?

476
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,541
You getting old or something?
Keep that stomach in, chin up.

477
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,516
Why do you think
I brought Grant to you?

478
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,110
Because I know you're the
best politician in the country.

479
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:20,147
Kay, a stubborn rank amateur.
Wilke was a stubborn rank amateur.

480
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,756
Get that political brain
of yours working.

481
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,428
This is the year
of the dark horse.

482
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,430
The best we could go
into that convention

483
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,261
with would be a small
handful of delegates.

484
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,891
Communists have taken over
whole countries

485
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,492
with a small
handful of delegates.

486
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,538
This guy worries me. The
way he shoots his mouth off.

487
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,266
He'll make enemies.

488
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,238
I'm sending Spike along
for just that.

489
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,472
Spike? I need Spike like
I need a hole in the head.

490
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,407
<i>Jim, The Thorndyke Press
needs a new vice president,</i>

491
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,951
a sort of silent partner to
advise on political matters.

492
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,918
Good salary, expense account
that might include

493
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,217
a four-year lease
on this house.

494
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,817
Win or lose?
Win or lose.

495
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,058
Well, the dark horse is
getting whiter.

496
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,595
Kay, just so I don't stumble
over things in the dark,

497
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,266
what's your stake in all this?
I want nothing.

498
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,999
No. People who want nothing
worry me. The price isn't right.

499
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,439
You know, I know about your
father and the Republican Party.

500
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,976
You also know that
they've given me

501
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,943
the beautiful brush-off
ever since.

502
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,579
On occasions
they've even seen fit

503
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,842
to describe the support
of my newspapers

504
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,645
<i>as the "kiss of death".</i>

505
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:22,915
I thought if I could present the
country and the Republican Party

506
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,479
with the next President
of the United States,

507
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:30,220
it would give me more than a little
pleasure to see certain heads roll.

508
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,120
If they're the same heads
I'm thinking about...

509
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,256
They are.

510
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,266
Let's put this thing over,
Jim.

511
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,631
He's the ideal man.

512
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,670
He's the rare combination
of sincerity

513
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,763
and drive that the common herd
will go for.

514
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,468
They think he's one of them.
He thinks he's one of them.

515
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,807
But is he the kind of man we
can handle? Will he play ball?

516
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,277
He's in love with me, Jim.

517
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:51,838
You can lead a dark horse to water with
that love stuff, but can you make him drink?

518
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,885
A moment ago,
you very shrewdly observed

519
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:55,476
that Grant saw ideals
out of one eye

520
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,318
and ambition out of the
other. You were dead right.

521
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:01,720
But wait till that presidential
bug really bites him.

522
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:04,791
Wait till he sees the White
House out of both eyes.

523
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,430
Then he'll drink.

524
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,897
And so will I.

525
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:19,803
The White House.

526
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:23,837
My, my, hallowed ground.
Just think.

527
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:28,682
All of the presidents since Adams
have occupied that noble edifice.

528
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,645
Needs painting.

529
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,851
I beg your pardon?
I say, it needs painting.

530
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,052
Needs painting?

531
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,729
Sir, you're the kind
who'd whitewash the dawn.

532
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:45,102
What colors would you add
to a desert sunset

533
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,970
or to the cool green of the
sea, or the blue of the sky?

534
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,509
Does the goddess of
liberty need make-up?

535
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:57,578
Do you know who lives
in this historic mansion?

536
00:26:58,717 --> 00:26:59,775
Yeah.

537
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:04,449
The spirit of all those who fought
for human dignity lives there.

538
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,325
Moses, Buddha, Confucius,

539
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,027
Christ, Paul, Saint Francis,

540
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:16,299
Thomas Aquinas, Roger Bacon,
Joan of Arc,

541
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,996
Martin Luther, Plato, Homer,

542
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:23,205
Dante, Shakespeare,
Michelangelo,

543
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,402
Pasteur, Newton, Galileo,

544
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:30,579
Edison, Franklin, Lincoln,
Washington, Jefferson,

545
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:33,810
Crispus Attucks,
Lafayette, Garibaldi,

546
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:36,186
Bolivar, Kosciusko.

547
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:38,882
The martyrs, the saints,
and the poets.

548
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,118
Civilizations past
and present.

549
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:42,318
Man's whole history.

550
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,919
His evolution from worm
to animal to Einstein,

551
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,691
his long search for God,

552
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,029
all those things live
in that noble dwelling,

553
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,500
but I still say
it needs painting.

554
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:59,532
Sir, may I buy you
a glass of beer?

555
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,169
With pleasure.

556
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,555
Could you bring my bags in
for me? Thank you.

557
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,333
Check with Leith before you
print that one. The rest of...

558
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:26,393
Jess, no more good stuff from
now on, just the cheap stuff.

559
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,564
If that's a long-distance call,
you'll pay for it yourself.

560
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,235
Mr. Conover, Mr. Conover, Mrs. Matthews
is here. Mrs. Matthews? Already?

561
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,245
Jim, don't faint now, but what
if she won't make this trip?

562
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,837
She's got to make it.

563
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,447
Jess, the good stuff for
Mrs. Matthews

564
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,541
and put a bottle of
champagne on ice. Yes, sir.

565
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:42,779
Where'll I put her? Put her
in Mr. Matthews' bedroom.

566
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,650
Take care of her bag. Remember
that phone call's on your own.

567
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,356
I'll mail everything in
from now on. Right.

568
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:03,404
I hope it doesn't inconvenience
you, my flying down tonight.

569
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:06,239
I'm delighted, I'm only sorry
you didn't get here earlier.

570
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:09,747
Spike, this is Mrs. Matthews.
Mr. MacManus.

571
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,509
Oh, the writer?
How do you do, Mr. MacManus?

572
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,451
And you're very beautiful. How are
you, Mrs. Matthews? I'll take this.

573
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,680
Where's my husband got to?

574
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,121
A politician's smoke-filled
room's got too much for him.

575
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,318
Oh, you're that Mr. Conover.
I'm afraid I am.

576
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,725
Grant went for a walk. He
didn't expect you until tomorrow.

577
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,320
I sent him a wire.

578
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,658
The fact is, Mr. Conover, I
was so excited about this trip,

579
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,224
I couldn't bear to wait.

580
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,994
Oh, is this my room?

581
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,130
No, this is Grant's room.
I'm getting you another.

582
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:37,674
Leave the bags here a minute.
You're moving Senator Fosdick.

583
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:38,902
Again?

584
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:42,105
Put him in the south
bedroom with Mr. Godfrey.

585
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,977
But the Commissioner's
in there with Mr. Godfrey.

586
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:45,174
Commissioner?

587
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,578
He can have the pool table.
That's nonsense.

588
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:51,120
Don't move Senator Fosdick.
Grant and I can stay here.

589
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,349
Here?

590
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:55,187
It's all right.
We're really married.

591
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,220
Unless the rest of the Senate
is in here with Grant.

592
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:01,026
No, no, he's in sole
possession. Good, I'll stay here.

593
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:05,430
After all, Senator Fosdick was an
isolationist. I think he should be isolated.

594
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:08,404
Shall I unpack for you, ma'am?
Don't bother. I'll do it later.

595
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,531
This is very pleasant.

596
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:11,074
Now I can boast that
I've really been

597
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,632
behind the scenes
in Washington.

598
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,234
You certainly can.

599
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,748
The Republican Party has been
behind the scenes for 15 years.

600
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,010
But that's over now.

601
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,675
We've won Congress
and there'll be a change

602
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,913
in the White House
after the next election.

603
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,545
Has Mr. Truman
heard about this?

604
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,457
I'm gonna like you.

605
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:30,994
I'm a good Republican.

606
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:33,690
The voters do control the lease
on the White House, don't they?

607
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,255
Not just the Republican Party.

608
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,597
Your husband's been lecturing
me along the same lines.

609
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,261
Then I'd better
change the subject.

610
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,932
Grant can be very outspoken.
But not by anybody I know.

611
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:46,770
May I fix you a drink? I'm a very
inexpensive guest. I don't drink.

612
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,775
You'll make history
in this house.

613
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,240
Has she moved in there?
She's established a beachhead.

614
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,717
Tell Jim it's all right
to convince the world

615
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,276
there's nothing between me
and Mr. Matthews,

616
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,618
but not to bother convincing
Mrs. Matthews.

617
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,180
I thought that was the idea.

618
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:03,125
Don't be naive, Spike. I want her
against me. I want her fighting for him.

619
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:06,686
That way she'll do everything
possible to get him elected.

620
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:09,827
Women.

621
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,133
Goodbye, Mr. MacManus.

622
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,166
Goodbye.

623
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,202
Bye.

624
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:18,873
Oh, thank you.

625
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:27,641
Mrs. Matthews, I have a great
admiration for your husband.

626
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:33,386
Look at that.
What did you say?

627
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,482
I say, I have a great
admiration for your husband.

628
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,028
I'm many years ahead of
you on that, Mr. Conover.

629
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,724
The whole country will feel as
we do after hearing the speeches

630
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:42,095
he's going to make
on this trip.

631
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,760
Speeches? Is he gonna make
speeches? Yes, in several places.

632
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,304
Oh, dear, I should've packed my earmuffs.

633
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:49,166
I didn't mean that
the way it sounded.

634
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,935
Grant makes
a very good speech,

635
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,239
but public appearances
for me...

636
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:54,842
Would it be considered
bad form,

637
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,403
if I just stayed
quietly at the hotel

638
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,312
and listened to him
over the radio?

639
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,214
I'm afraid it would. It would
defeat the whole purpose.

640
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:01,616
Purpose? What purpose?

641
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,950
For a man who may become
a political figure,

642
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:06,582
people like to know his wife,
like to see what she looks like,

643
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:09,889
and most important of all, they
like to see the two of them together.

644
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:10,950
Oh.

645
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,657
I see.

646
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,762
That explains Grant's inviting
me to make this trip with him.

647
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,802
No, no, no,
Grant wants you to go along.

648
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,531
These public appearances,
they're my idea.

649
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,869
Just an old politician's habit
of cashing in on an opportunity.

650
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,102
It all fits a little
too neatly, Mr. Conover.

651
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,541
I don't know whether you know,
or perhaps you do,

652
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,138
that Grant and I haven't
been very close recently.

653
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,408
Wouldn't you prefer to
create a contrary impression?

654
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:34,746
Then you do know.

655
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,349
Let's be open about this,
Mr. Conover.

656
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,357
These public appearances that
Grant and I are going to make,

657
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,052
are they designed
to kill off any talk

658
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,889
about my husband
and Kay Thorndyke?

659
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,123
There's that kind of talk
about every important man.

660
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:47,755
If there are any rumors
about your husband,

661
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,561
this would be a good chance
to kill them. You see...

662
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,363
No, may I use your telephone?

663
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,404
Certainly. On the night table.
Thank you.

664
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,565
I want to get back to New
York tonight, if I can.

665
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,903
Airport...
Executive 2345.

666
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,343
Thank you.

667
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,885
Mrs. Matthews?

668
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:12,889
I think any man who has a chance to
become President of the United States

669
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,822
deserves that chance.

670
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,595
President of
the United States?

671
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:23,963
Yes. Don't you think
he'd make a good president?

672
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,902
Yes, I do.

673
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:30,101
A fine president.

674
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:33,369
Then you see how this goes
beyond personal considerations.

675
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,906
We can't think of this just
in terms of you and Grant.

676
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,538
And Kay Thorndyke.

677
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,708
And Kay Thorndyke. I'm sure
you'll go along with this.

678
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,183
You're a good citizen.

679
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:44,244
Right now, Mr. Conover, I'm
not feeling like a good citizen.

680
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:45,516
I'm feeling like a woman.

681
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,082
All right, as a woman, then. As
a woman, no, I resent being used.

682
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:53,320
This evening has been quite a kick
in the teeth to me, Mr. Conover.

683
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,192
I was hoping that

684
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,200
Grant's call meant
no more Miss Thorndyke.

685
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,704
It'd be fine
to kill these rumors.

686
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,138
It'd be even finer
to kill Kay Thorndyke.

687
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,005
Let's think of this in terms of the
country. That's what I've had to do.

688
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:09,706
Frankly, your husband is not the
answer to a politician's dream.

689
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,306
I've been wondering why any
political party should choose Grant,

690
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,748
knowing the things
he stands for.

691
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,115
I want the country
to make the choice,

692
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,154
and I know the choice
they'll make.

693
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,118
Take my word. Your husband
is a pretty big man.

694
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:22,182
There's no argument
about that.

695
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,827
I know he's a big man.
You know he's a big man.

696
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,990
My bad days are when
he knows he's a big man.

697
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,194
You don't suppose
there's any way

698
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,667
of Grant's being
elected president

699
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,704
and keeping it
a secret from him, do you?

700
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,164
It wasn't as funny
as all that.

701
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,539
Yes, it was. Your husband asked
me almost the same question.

702
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,237
He wondered if
he could be elected

703
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,109
without a wife
knowing about it.

704
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:44,512
Poor Grant.

705
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,142
Is he speaking in Seattle?
Yes. Why?

706
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,650
We were married in Seattle.

707
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,778
When I think of him
speaking there

708
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,380
as a candidate
for president...

709
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,256
He's not speaking now as a
candidate. That's a deep, dark secret.

710
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:59,319
The whole idea of this trip
is to create the demand.

711
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:00,789
Oh.

712
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:03,128
That clears up something
you just said.

713
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:06,568
He's to be your choice first,
then the people's choice.

714
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,362
Well, I'm a citizen.
I have the right to a choice.

715
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,541
Long distance calling,
Mr. Conover.

716
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,803
Thank you, Norah.
May I take it here?

717
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:16,472
Am I in the way? Not at all.
This will take just a minute.

718
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,907
Hello.

719
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:19,609
Yes. How are you?

720
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:23,078
Yes, I'm sorry, too, Joe. You
should have carried that district.

721
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:26,487
Advice? My advice is to change
your whole campaign this year.

722
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:29,521
How many Poles have you
got down there? That many?

723
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,523
Tell them not to believe
what they read in the papers.

724
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:34,190
Tell them we love Poland and we're
going to lend them a lot of money.

725
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,790
Oh, they don't feel
that way about it?

726
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,634
Well, tell them Poland won't
get one red cent out of us.

727
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:43,598
The Democrats have
beaten us to that?

728
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,336
Well, promise them
something else.

729
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,343
They must want something,
just promise them!

730
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:50,504
You swing that district and they'll
have to give you that Veterans' Hospital.

731
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,048
Otherwise, no dice.

732
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:54,583
Call any time. Thanks.

733
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,780
Sorry for the interruption.

734
00:35:56,854 --> 00:36:00,312
I'm grateful for it. It gave
me a chance to change my mind.

735
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:02,324
I'll make this trip
with Grant.

736
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:03,893
Well, that's fine.

737
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,690
That pleases me very much.

738
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:08,755
That's our first big
campaign contribution.

739
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:13,226
To you, my dear, the loveliest
plank in your husband's platform.

740
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,067
That's a heck of a thing
to call a woman.

741
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:18,038
Still, you did say loveliest.

742
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,974
Think of any more words like
that, don't repress them.

743
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:22,740
Don't tell me you'd fall for
a politician's sweet syrup.

744
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:25,839
Mister, you're looking at
a mighty dry waffle.

745
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:27,775
I don't know.

746
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,547
This trip may kill
more than one rumor.

747
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,281
Is there someone
I don't know about?

748
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,755
There have been some rumors
about you.

749
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:35,517
About me?

750
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:38,061
Hmm. About you
and a certain major.

751
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,820
That's wonderful. That's the
best news I've heard in weeks.

752
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:42,593
Does Grant know?
Not as far as I know.

753
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,794
You're going to tell him, aren't you? No.

754
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,497
I deserve something out of all
this. I was hoping he'd told you.

755
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:50,302
No, I have a little
intelligence service of my own.

756
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:54,333
I wish Grant had. The places I've
dragged that poor, nice major,

757
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:57,245
just in the hopes
that Grant would see us.

758
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,380
I'm beginning to feel
like a new woman.

759
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,317
I think I'll put a new face
on the new woman.

760
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:06,817
And I feel like a new man and I
think I'll give the new man a drink.

761
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:10,192
How about it?
We have even champagne here.

762
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:13,992
Don't ever tempt me that way.
The results can be disastrous.

763
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,123
No!

764
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,666
Has Grant told you
we haven't seen each other

765
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,894
in nearly four months?

766
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:21,530
No. Our last encounter
was something to remember.

767
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,966
Kay has quite a technique
with husbands.

768
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,508
Other women's, that is.

769
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,439
She's a great builder-upper.

770
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,036
Grant was getting the
inflation treatment that night.

771
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,373
Which, by the way,
he doesn't mind at all.

772
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,647
So, I inflated myself a little,
too, starting with martinis.

773
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,778
And told her off.

774
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:38,287
Off and out of my house.

775
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,688
I played right into her hands.
I acted like a fishwife.

776
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,749
It's the olive in the
martinis. That's what does this.

777
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:45,625
No, things were simmering
before that.

778
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,926
Grant needs a lot of room
to stretch in.

779
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:51,526
He likes to get up on those mountain
tops and slap the hurricanes down.

780
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,001
He can do it, too.

781
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,195
He began to feel that
I was sort of small potatoes

782
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,797
and holding him back.

783
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,236
I was, I guess.

784
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:01,642
I'm a sort of a cozy
corner person, Mr. Conover.

785
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,073
I like those quiet valleys.

786
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:08,981
I'm afraid I even have a
weakness for small potatoes.

787
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,920
I've got two wonderful ones
at home. Yes, happy birthday.

788
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,958
There we were. Grant had
a bad case of the mountains

789
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,823
and I became stubborn
about small potatoes,

790
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,522
and she stepped into the picture
as the beautiful mountain guide.

791
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,861
Now I have no way of knowing
how far things have gone.

792
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,058
How do you mean?

793
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,102
There are three stages
in a man's,

794
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,330
whatever you want to call it,
to Kay Thorndyke.

795
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:29,737
First he follows her
with his eyes,

796
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,241
then with his feet,
then on his knees.

797
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,835
My trouble is, I don't know
whether Grant is still in stage two

798
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,436
or if the boat has sailed.

799
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:38,272
Jim.

800
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,814
Mary gets in tonight. I got
this telegram downstairs...

801
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:43,148
Hello, Grant.

802
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,352
Mary.

803
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,850
I didn't expect you
until tomorrow.

804
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,392
I couldn't bear to wait.
I'd have met you.

805
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,655
How are you?
Fine. You look fine.

806
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:54,095
I'm certainly glad you came. I've
got a lot of things to tell you.

807
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,498
Have you got a room set up for
her yet? I'm in here with you.

808
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:58,862
In here?

809
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,833
Mr. Conover, Governor
Dunn has just arrived.

810
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,739
Ex-Governor. That old windbag
didn't even carry his own county.

811
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,743
Where am I going to
put him? He snores, too.

812
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:09,041
That's an occupational
disease of governors.

813
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,513
Grant, I couldn't wait. I told
Mrs. Matthews all about it.

814
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,678
Well, I'm awfully glad
you came.

815
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:20,981
I said that, didn't I?

816
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:24,721
How are the kids?
Fine. Anxious to see you.

817
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,261
Same here.

818
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,895
Why don't you laugh?
You should. Why, Grant?

819
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,165
I've just been for a walk.

820
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:36,466
You know,
it's a funny thing, Mary,

821
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:40,304
I've been in Washington a thousand
times in the past few years,

822
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,971
but I never really saw it
until today.

823
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,446
It isn't a city.
It's an atmosphere.

824
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,507
It's alive with giants.

825
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:53,480
Washington, Jefferson,
Lincoln, Adams. Giants, Mary.

826
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,255
I'm not in their league.

827
00:39:56,327 --> 00:40:00,093
I'm for you, Grant. I think
you'd make a wonderful president.

828
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:06,266
Do you really mean that? I've
never meant anything more.

829
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:12,004
That's the nicest thing
you could've said.

830
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:14,634
It isn't only that you've
got the brains for it.

831
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,202
The important thing
to me, Grant,

832
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,840
is that you've always
tried to be honest.

833
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,314
Tried to be?

834
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:22,443
You've cut some corners
here and there,

835
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,181
just to get where
you wanted to.

836
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,520
But I will say, you've always had
the decency to be unhappy about it.

837
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,785
Yeah, with a little help
from you.

838
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,225
And don't call me Nappy.
Yes, Nappy.

839
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:35,061
I want you to know, Mary, that
I felt a little bit of a heel,

840
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,996
asking you to make this trip
at all under the circumstances.

841
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,764
I told Conover that it was entirely
up to you, that I wouldn't...

842
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:44,865
It's all right, Grant.
I made the decision myself.

843
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:49,744
You know, Mary, you deserve
something better than me.

844
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:54,548
Well, I guess,
I'd better get out of these.

845
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,019
I'd better see Jim about
getting me another room.

846
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,889
Haven't you heard? Even
the pool table's booked.

847
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,759
I guess I can find a room
in a hotel, all right.

848
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,321
In Washington?

849
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,403
Grant? Grant!

850
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,665
Huh?

851
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:18,164
We should call
the kids tomorrow.

852
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:22,039
Yes, yes. Well, I'll call
them around dinnertime,

853
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:24,137
then I can talk
to both of them.

854
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:27,381
I had Buck pack some of
your fishing things.

855
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,575
Oh, wonderful.

856
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,520
Thought maybe when we were
in Seattle... Yeah, fine.

857
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,354
Might be able to run up to
Victoria for a couple of days.

858
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,394
We haven't been there
since our...

859
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,452
Not since our honeymoon.

860
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,127
No. That's right.

861
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:48,298
Which of the plants are we
going to first? Minneapolis.

862
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,207
What are you
speaking about there?

863
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:55,234
I'm not going to speak there.
That's Stassen territory.

864
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:58,406
Conover thought I might
just stir up trouble. Uh-huh.

865
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,746
Good politics, I suppose.

866
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,218
What other decisions
does Conover make for you?

867
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,882
Wait a minute, Mary. I made that
decision. I'm making all the decisions.

868
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:09,289
I've told Conover
exactly where I stand.

869
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:12,226
See, the American people today
face too many problems... Grant.

870
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:13,354
Huh.

871
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,455
Take it easy.
I'm going to vote for you.

872
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,696
No, wait a minute. I want to
straighten you out on this thing, too.

873
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,666
Yes?

874
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:27,439
Could I turn the bed down
now? Yes, indeed. You may.

875
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:30,378
When you're ready for breakfast
just press that buzzer,

876
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:31,505
I'll have it right up.

877
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:32,606
Thank you.

878
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,947
I've got a pretty
tough day tomorrow.

879
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,177
I'm sorry to be
so late with this.

880
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,279
It's all right. I'll help
you with it. Thank you.

881
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:41,187
Just as I started up,
we got another guest.

882
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:43,419
Gracious!
Where did you put him?

883
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,359
He's on a cot
in Mr. Conover's room.

884
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:46,953
That makes me
feel very guilty.

885
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,555
Don't you worry,
Mrs. Matthews.

886
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,623
A cot's good enough
for most of them.

887
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:52,894
They just come down here to get
something out of Mr. Conover.

888
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:56,497
Why, Norah! Not the
people we put in this room.

889
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:59,572
This room is for
special guests.

890
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:03,003
We even had a Democrat
in this bed one night.

891
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:05,513
Oh, dear. I wish you hadn't
told me that.

892
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,983
He wasn't
a Roosevelt Democrat.

893
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:13,487
Did he leave these
as a souvenir?

894
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:17,820
How did those get in here? That Miss
Thorndyke hunted all over for those.

895
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:20,989
Miss Thorndyke? Yes, she forgot
them when she left tonight.

896
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:22,828
I know what it is
to be without glasses.

897
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,629
I'll mail them
right back to her.

898
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:26,260
You wouldn't know her
address, would you, ma'am?

899
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:29,306
Are you sure these are
Miss Thorndyke's? Yes.

900
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,231
They're them
Chinese kind. See?

901
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:36,936
What some women won't do,
won't they? Yes, won't they?

902
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,849
Mr. Matthews
will know the address.

903
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,984
Grant, can you
come out here a minute?

904
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:45,521
Norah needs some information.

905
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,887
Yeah, sure.
I'll be right out.

906
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:51,460
Yeah, Norah,
what can I do for you?

907
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:52,654
Miss Thorndyke
left her glasses.

908
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,824
I just wanted to know where
to mail them back to her.

909
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:00,861
1276 Park Avenue. Would you
like me to write it down for you?

910
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,236
No, I can remember it.
1276.

911
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,740
76, that's the year
of the Revolution,

912
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,902
and 12, that's for
the 12 Commandments.

913
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:10,507
Well...

914
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,712
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

915
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,222
Now how do you suppose
those got in here?

916
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,449
Why did she leave?

917
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:23,391
We could all have had a
lovely weekend here together.

918
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,504
Mary, what do you think
you're doing?

919
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:13,902
Mary, stop that nonsense
and make up this bed again.

920
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,677
Now hang it all. Look here, I'm
not going to have you do this.

921
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,978
You wouldn't get one wink of
sleep down there on the floor,

922
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,541
and I wouldn't sleep, lying
up here worrying about you.

923
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,382
Goodnight, Mr. President.

924
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:35,760
You mean Mr. Vice President,
don't you?

925
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,403
Look. We put this bird across,
and you know what it means to us.

926
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:48,445
We got to work fast but we've
got to be smart about it.

927
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:50,776
Here's a list of guys
who might play ball.

928
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:52,475
Er, Bluckner.
You feel out Bluckner.

929
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:54,983
He's committed to Dewey.
Go on to the second ballot.

930
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,713
He'd back Stalin if it'd cut
the Governor's throat.

931
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,277
There's your
long-distance call.

932
00:45:58,355 --> 00:45:59,982
You work on that angle,
will you?

933
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:02,548
Hello, J.L. Is your group
committed yet?

934
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:04,787
Now quit worrying, I've got
the man, but I'm not ready

935
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:05,954
to announce his name yet.

936
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:08,964
He's brand new.
Hates politicians. What?

937
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:12,524
For those few measly Arizona
delegates? I should say not.

938
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,070
Okay, you'll hear from me.

939
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:16,572
How about Trenley?
No, you can't trust Trenley.

940
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,471
You can't trust Trenley?
What do you think, Senator?

941
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:21,238
I don't trust Trenley and I don't
like the smell of this. Why not?

942
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:23,541
<i>I don't like anything that
starts with The Thorndyke Press.</i>

943
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,276
Those three papers in your state
can ensure your re-election.

944
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,080
I'll have to take my chances
on that, Jim. Goodnight.

945
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:32,180
How did he get in here?
He's honest.

946
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:35,282
Let's forget about him. What
about Sylvester in Philadelphia?

947
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:36,485
Fine.
Good man.

948
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,524
What's so funny?

949
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:45,260
I was just wondering how the
floors are in the White House.

950
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,670
I'll take the floor there.
I know my place.

951
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,203
Grant?

952
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,745
Are you still in stage two

953
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,813
or have you made
stage three now?

954
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:02,045
What do you mean?

955
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,619
Never mind.

956
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:08,486
Do you want a divorce?

957
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:12,723
Do you?

958
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,932
That's not fair.
I asked you first.

959
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:29,111
The world thinks
I'm a very successful man.

960
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,238
Rich, influential, happy.

961
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,548
You know better,
don't you, Mary?

962
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:38,978
You know that I'm neither
happy nor successful,

963
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:42,284
not as a man, a husband,
or a father.

964
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:46,225
You want to know
something else?

965
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:49,322
I'm glad I'm down here on the
floor. It's where I belong.

966
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,361
I knew that tonight when
we started to talk about

967
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:54,370
going back to Victoria.

968
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,299
Mary, you won't believe this,

969
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,468
but I don't know how
those glasses got in here,

970
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,341
but I'm glad you found them.

971
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,278
I started to tell you, it was
Kay who brought me down here,

972
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:09,615
but I lost my nerve. I guess I
was afraid it would send you home.

973
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:22,160
<i>"There are moments in the life of
every man when he glimpses the eternal."</i>

974
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,461
You read that to me, remember?

975
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:30,198
I've had moments
like that, Mary.

976
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:31,706
A couple of them.

977
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:34,000
When I was up
in a plane alone.

978
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:38,376
Moments when the earth and
the sky and the plane and me

979
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:42,316
all seemed to fuse together into
something that would live forever.

980
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,749
And I had a moment
like that today, Mary,

981
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,985
when I was alone
with all those great men.

982
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:53,921
They were happy men, Mary.
Do you know why?

983
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:55,854
They had a cause.

984
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,230
They had a cause
they could die for.

985
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,031
Some of them did.

986
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:04,171
I have no cause, Mary.

987
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,073
Beating your competitors.

988
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,478
No cause to die for.

989
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,606
Really isn't very much
to live for.

990
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,446
Always me first
and everybody else second.

991
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,721
But, way down deep
in my gizzard, I...

992
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:24,917
Maybe this trip,

993
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:28,293
maybe this whole absurd idea
of Conover's...

994
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:32,467
Well, anyway,

995
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,271
I'm going to stay on the floor
through the whole trip.

996
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,398
And maybe when it's all over,

997
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:44,237
well,

998
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:46,342
one way or another,

999
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:49,647
everything should be clean
and honest between us, right?

1000
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:54,953
Well, you've answered
one question.

1001
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:56,556
What?

1002
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,193
You're still not
in stage three.

1003
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:18,074
<i>There, mon cher
monsignor Matthews,</i>

1004
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:20,946
is something to gladden the heart
of every citizen west of the Rockies.

1005
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,918
What is it?
The Seattle speech.

1006
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,817
A masterpiece of rhetoric,
if I do say so.

1007
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:26,947
Who's going to make it?
You are, of course.

1008
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:30,187
Really? I thought maybe they set up
a change and you were the candidate.

1009
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,319
No, I'm saving myself
for '52.

1010
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:34,728
Well, you better
save the speech, too.

1011
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:36,231
How do you like that?

1012
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,460
What do I do? Just sit around
here with egg on my face?

1013
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,163
I'm the expert that keeps you
from climbing out on limbs.

1014
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:43,103
That's where
the big red apples are.

1015
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,765
Where?
Out on the limbs.

1016
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:47,542
Mama.
All right,

1017
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,704
all right, if you don't want
to be President.

1018
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,045
You just line up the babies for me
to kiss, son, and I'll be a cinch.

1019
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:55,983
That reminds me, do I
know any babies in Seattle?

1020
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:05,458
Hey, boss, we got company.
Huh?

1021
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,725
Who?
Joe and Rusty!

1022
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:10,031
Joe Crandall, manager
of our Cleveland plant.

1023
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,261
He's a wonderful guy.
Just flew up to see us.

1024
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:23,005
He's hooked onto us!
Rusty at the controls.

1025
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,809
Joe and Rusty! Here's
where I make some money.

1026
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:27,907
I'm going to take over. You're
not going to fly this thing.

1027
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:31,078
You got to learn sometime, come
on, shove over there. Shove over.

1028
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:37,191
Aren't you going to stop him? I
suggest you better strap yourself in.

1029
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,660
What for?
Just do what Mama tells you.

1030
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:41,629
If you have any loose teeth,
hang on to them,

1031
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:44,565
Rusty's our chief test pilot.
He and Grant like to play.

1032
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:46,735
I'm not going to
like this.

1033
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:48,499
Look at those guys.

1034
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:50,699
Kind of close.
They came up to play.

1035
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:52,468
What do we got up here?
3210.

1036
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:56,904
Oh!

1037
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:58,980
I got it.
Okay.

1038
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:01,740
How you doing, Rusty?
Hi, boss.

1039
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:03,843
I'm testing the new
plane-to-plane radio.

1040
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,115
It's coming along fine.
What's the matter with you?

1041
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:08,123
You getting scared?
Can't get any closer?

1042
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:09,852
<i>Hey, boss,
can you still fly?</i>

1043
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:12,121
I can pat your ears
down anytime.

1044
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:13,626
You got any dough?

1045
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:14,823
<i>I'm loaded.</i>

1046
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:16,456
A buck I lose you.

1047
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,693
Put your money
where your mouth is, brother.

1048
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:19,860
<i>Okay, you're on.</i>

1049
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:21,927
Hey, you're hooked up?
Yes.

1050
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:23,267
Hang on!

1051
00:52:37,387 --> 00:52:39,082
Mary, what's he doing?

1052
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:48,223
You better stay away from me,
I'll cut your tail off.

1053
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,773
Hello? Where is he?

1054
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:03,506
There he is.

1055
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:15,987
If your husband
must have a hobby,

1056
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:18,857
why can't he play the piano,
like any normal president?

1057
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,862
Come on, Rusty,
do something!

1058
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,124
Uh-oh, a loop.

1059
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:34,026
What's the matter,
Spike, can't you take it?

1060
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:39,636
Kid, you're in a rut. You're
running out of stunts, aren't you?

1061
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:47,574
Boss, you're not going
to spin this thing?

1062
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:49,208
Why not? I built it.

1063
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,930
Hope the wings stay on.
So do I.

1064
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:09,462
Did they stay on?

1065
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,901
I'm afraid to look.

1066
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:15,439
Not bad for an old man.

1067
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:17,104
Never mind the
"old man" stuff.

1068
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:19,840
<i>That's a buck
you owe me.</i>

1069
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,344
We're over the airfield.

1070
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:23,409
Five more says
I beat you down.

1071
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:25,314
Make it 10
and you've got a deal.

1072
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:26,946
Get your money ready.

1073
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:28,981
I'll take half of it.

1074
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,625
What's going...

1075
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:33,920
Hey.

1076
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,697
Why, the son of a gun
pulled a jump on me.

1077
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:44,003
Take it over.

1078
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:45,735
Get me right over it.

1079
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:50,308
Grant! Boy, am I glad
to see you.

1080
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:52,910
Sit down, pal.

1081
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:54,478
What do you
think of that?

1082
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:56,348
Say, that was swell fun.

1083
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:58,250
Enjoyed every minute of it.

1084
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:01,249
Grant, don't you think it...
What do you think of that, fella?

1085
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:02,757
I got a
$10 bet with him.

1086
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:04,919
Yeah, but don't you think... Now, what?

1087
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,257
Coming over.

1088
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:13,460
Cut down that left engine.

1089
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:16,636
Give my love to Conover.

1090
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:17,832
Grant!

1091
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:21,609
Mary, he fell out!

1092
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:25,480
Did you happen to notice
was he wearing a parachute?

1093
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:27,643
Parachute?

1094
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:41,557
You mean he did that for $10?

1095
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,964
Did it open?

1096
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:47,930
Did it open?

1097
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,104
Did it open?

1098
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:52,839
Yeah, it opened.

1099
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,881
We're a cinch to get
the screwball vote.

1100
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:14,525
Well, well. The fourth
estate, what goes? Another war?

1101
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,293
Hi, Jim, stuffed any
ballot boxes lately?

1102
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:19,164
You're to go right in,
Mr. Conover.

1103
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:21,362
Could it be we're in politics, gentlemen?

1104
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:22,833
Looks that way.

1105
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,437
What's the convention
out there?

1106
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:26,805
My editors.
I had them fly in.

1107
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:29,436
But some of them recognized
me. Don't worry, Jim,

1108
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:30,911
we're in business.

1109
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,740
<i>"'Public response
to my line of guff astounding.</i>

1110
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:37,616
<i>"'lf I throw my hat in rings, does
my head go with it?' Grant Matthews."</i>

1111
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:39,552
Well, the bug's beginning
to bite, huh?

1112
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,817
You're so right. Now,
we can really go to work.

1113
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,620
My reports on him
have been terrific.

1114
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:44,853
What've you heard?
Nothing.

1115
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:46,395
Goes over with the mob,
no doubt about that.

1116
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,192
Who told you that? Made a
big hit in the Northwest.

1117
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:50,960
Los Angeles was fine, too. Of
course, that's a push-over town.

1118
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:53,332
It's the Mid-West that...
I know.

1119
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:55,530
He's in Wichita this noon,
big labor rally.

1120
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:57,072
Detroit tonight.
Big business banquet.

1121
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,835
That's it.
Got my fingers crossed.

1122
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:00,500
If he gets by those two,
we are in business.

1123
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:02,568
How do your political friends
feel about him?

1124
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,942
Well, now,

1125
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,012
that's what I want to
talk to you about.

1126
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:08,948
Ed Lauterback wants in.

1127
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,613
Well? Wanted to see if
you'd stand for Lauterback.

1128
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:13,383
We'll stand for anyone
if they've got delegates.

1129
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:14,821
Even Bill Hardy?

1130
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:17,325
You're dragging them out from
under the rocks, aren't you?

1131
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:19,554
Those are the ones who do
the work, the hungry ones.

1132
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:21,597
Okay, Jim, Bill Hardy, too. Good.

1133
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:23,857
<i>Send them in, Helen.
Yes, ma'am.</i>

1134
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:26,024
Would you come over here, Jim? Hmm.

1135
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:28,730
Good morning, Miss Thorndyke. Good morning.

1136
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:30,670
Sorry to have kept
you gentlemen waiting.

1137
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,970
You know Mr. Conover,
our new political advisor?

1138
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:34,634
Gentlemen.

1139
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:39,942
First of all, I'd like to thank you
all for the very fine job you've done.

1140
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:43,279
You haven't always followed
my advice in the past.

1141
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:47,720
You've been very lenient, considering
your boss is a woman and still under 60.

1142
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:50,715
I've asked you all
to come here today

1143
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:52,785
because in this matter,
at least,

1144
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:55,626
there can be no deviation
from my instructions.

1145
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:58,832
I want the Republican
Convention deadlocked.

1146
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,299
Who are we working for,
the Democrats?

1147
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:04,066
<i>You're working for
The Thorndyke Press</i>

1148
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,233
<i>and The Thorndyke Press
will have its own candidate.</i>

1149
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:08,834
That's why that Convention
must be deadlocked.

1150
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:09,969
And it won't be

1151
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,445
unless the leading candidates
are so sore at each other

1152
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:14,380
that they won't combine
forces. Is that clear?

1153
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:18,877
I want Dewey sore at Taft, Taft sore at
Vandenberg, Vandenberg sore at Stassen

1154
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:21,355
and all of them sore
at Eisenhower and MacArthur!

1155
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:25,124
Use their wives, their kids, their
Aunt Marthas, but get them sore.

1156
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:26,525
Dig up anything you can.

1157
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:27,960
And if you can't dig it up...

1158
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:30,693
Chief, I've got nothing
against your candidate.

1159
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,427
We all know who it is.

1160
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:35,629
And I'll work for him in any
way that I legitimately can.

1161
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:37,763
But that's as far as I can go.

1162
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:39,272
Mr. Bradbury,

1163
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:42,136
would you feel happier working
for some other newspaper?

1164
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:45,703
Yes, I think I would.

1165
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:48,140
I think that can
be arranged.

1166
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:53,716
Anyone else?

1167
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,014
Now is the time.

1168
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:58,321
On this issue, I'm quite
prepared to replace all of you.

1169
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:01,525
Miss Thorndyke, you're mad.
You're as mad as your father.

1170
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:03,462
You can accept
my resignation right now.

1171
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:05,728
That goes for me. That's
exactly the way I feel.

1172
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:07,269
All right, get out,
all of you.

1173
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:09,897
Editors like you
are a dime a dozen.

1174
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:14,936
<i>Yes? It's for Mr. Conover, Wichita calling.</i>

1175
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:18,003
That'll be Brander. I had
him fly out to hear Grant.

1176
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:19,307
Hello J.B., how are you?

1177
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:24,445
Wait a minute,
there must be some mistake.

1178
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:27,114
Take my word for it,
everything'll be all right.

1179
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:28,986
J.B., now, wait a minute.

1180
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:30,252
He hung up.
What happened?

1181
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:31,418
I don't know.
According to Brander,

1182
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:32,722
Grant's blown his top
on labor.

1183
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,931
<i>Yes? Mr. MacManus from Wichita.</i>

1184
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,195
<i>Spike, what happened? Grant
just lost the labor vote.</i>

1185
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:41,133
I sent you along
to prevent just that.

1186
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:43,737
I couldn't help it.
He's gotten away from me.

1187
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,603
You're a great
campaign manager.

1188
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,938
Didn't you look at
that speech before he made it?

1189
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:49,602
No, and I'll tell you why.

1190
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:51,873
I touted him off
that labor stuff in Denver.

1191
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:55,145
She knew he'd change his mind, and
started throwing those harpoons into him.

1192
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:56,583
<i>You mean, his wife?</i>

1193
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,348
I don't mean his Aunt Tilly.

1194
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:00,614
You sent the wrong dame
on this trip, that's all.

1195
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,314
And I talked him
into taking her along.

1196
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:04,292
What's he talking about
in Detroit tonight?

1197
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:06,624
How would I know?
I lost my Ouija board.

1198
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:08,958
I told you we couldn't trust
him. He's believing his own stuff.

1199
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:11,193
If he blows his top
on business, like on labor,

1200
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:13,258
well, I'll blow mine.
That woman's got to him.

1201
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:16,096
She's been feeding him that "to
thine own self be true" diet.

1202
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:17,968
Get out to Detroit
as fast as you can.

1203
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:20,804
Spike, Jim's flying out.
Book Cadillac Hotel.

1204
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:30,213
Got it?

1205
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,350
I'm very sorry boys,
we're way behind schedule.

1206
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:40,621
You can see Mr. Matthews
after his speech tonight.

1207
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:44,992
You need a shave, don't you?
My feet.

1208
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,826
My ears.
Those police sirens.

1209
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:51,134
No more motorcycle escorts,
Spike. We might kill somebody.

1210
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,265
I'll arrange that for you
on the way to the banquet.

1211
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:55,742
Where do you want these?
Mary, pick your room.

1212
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:57,143
Wonderful country.

1213
01:01:57,246 --> 01:02:00,579
You have to take the police
along to break the speed laws.

1214
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:02,514
This is a nice room.
You can put those in there.

1215
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:05,145
This is 2419.
Send up a barber right away.

1216
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,049
Mary, look at these.

1217
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:09,321
Those can wait.

1218
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:11,325
In one hour, you're on
the air, coast to coast.

1219
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:14,453
You have to eat, dress, shave, and
interview most of Detroit in the meantime.

1220
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,896
Oh, these are wonderful,
Grant.

1221
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:18,763
All about the Wichita speech.

1222
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:21,429
Yeah. You never had
anything like this before.

1223
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:23,799
What do you want to eat?
Anything but chicken.

1224
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,033
Yeah, look, pinfeathers.

1225
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:27,403
Hello, Room Service?

1226
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:30,674
Hey, babe, what's with the service?
You'll get your box of candy.

1227
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,645
Here's somebody who
didn't like it. Who's that?

1228
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,743
Executive Secretary,
Local 301.

1229
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:41,349
I turned on the radiator,
opened the window.

1230
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,857
Oh, all right, thank you.

1231
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,689
Hello? Room Service?
Thank you.

1232
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:48,758
This is 2419, will you rush up
three hamburgers, please?

1233
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:50,662
Wait a minute. Onions?

1234
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:52,496
Onions? No!

1235
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:54,166
One with onions.
Two without.

1236
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:56,671
Grant, who's Madman Muntz?

1237
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:58,534
Don't you know?
Uh-uh.

1238
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:02,638
I'm expecting a lot of people
for Mr. Matthews.

1239
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:06,478
Will you shoot them up to 24th floor,
Parlor B and tell them to wait? Right.

1240
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:07,709
Want a barber?

1241
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:09,578
Not at the moment.
Yes!

1242
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:11,242
Oh, for Mr. Matthews.

1243
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:12,946
Come in.
Good evening.

1244
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:15,114
Good evening. Good evening.
Mary did you see this?

1245
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:17,419
"Matthews is obvious presidential
timber", you read that?

1246
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:18,585
Mr. Matthews.

1247
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:20,924
I knew that Wichita speech
would ring the bell.

1248
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:22,998
Yeah, the kid here
tried to talk me out of it.

1249
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,558
Dream on, Macduff.

1250
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,827
I told you not to be afraid
of shooting the works.

1251
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:28,302
That's how they want
to hear you talk.

1252
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:31,169
Wait 'til you hear me on industry
tonight, I'm really going to let loose.

1253
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,573
Grant, let's not stop. Let's keep
going. Let's do it all over again.

1254
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:37,974
You want to know something?

1255
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,879
I think this trip's
agreed with you.

1256
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:45,118
You have no right to look so
pretty, a woman of your age.

1257
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:46,279
Oh, Grant.

1258
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:48,380
When you were standing
at the airport in Denver,

1259
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:50,152
I had the strangest sensation.

1260
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:52,159
What sensation?
Mr. Matthews,

1261
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:54,092
I represent 800 members

1262
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,222
of the League for
the Abolition of Taxation.

1263
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:00,496
The Government should earn its
own money. Like the rest of us.

1264
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:01,830
Abolish taxation.

1265
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:05,430
Thank you... There is no
justice in this great...

1266
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:08,803
Looks a little like
your brother Dick.

1267
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,986
Go on, Grant.
Hmm?

1268
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:20,986
What sensation?

1269
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:25,358
Oh, well, you were standing there
at the airport in the moonlight.

1270
01:04:25,772 --> 01:04:28,536
And the wind from the
propeller was blowing your hair.

1271
01:04:28,608 --> 01:04:31,543
And your dress... Will
I get your other bags now?

1272
01:04:32,713 --> 01:04:34,874
Yes, now, just go.

1273
01:04:40,821 --> 01:04:43,187
Go on, Grant.
Hmm?

1274
01:04:44,391 --> 01:04:46,450
Go on with
what you were saying.

1275
01:04:46,893 --> 01:04:48,485
Where was I?
Looking at her

1276
01:04:48,562 --> 01:04:51,087
<i>with the wind blowing her
dress, mannaggia, I'America!</i>

1277
01:04:51,164 --> 01:04:54,258
Well, that's the end of that.
I should have married a barber.

1278
01:04:54,334 --> 01:04:55,392
Mary.

1279
01:04:58,305 --> 01:04:59,636
Mary, what I was
going to say...

1280
01:04:59,706 --> 01:05:01,867
Hey, you should be getting
dressed. There are people coming...

1281
01:05:01,942 --> 01:05:04,308
I love you, Spike, but
sometimes I wish you'd drop dead.

1282
01:05:04,378 --> 01:05:05,902
Too late for apologies.

1283
01:05:07,681 --> 01:05:09,512
I could sleep for a week.

1284
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:12,245
<i>"Matthews
obvious presidential."</i>

1285
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:14,287
That's no solution.

1286
01:05:14,454 --> 01:05:16,479
I beg your pardon?
That's no solution.

1287
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:19,354
What's that?
You, make a new presidente.

1288
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,095
You got a better solution?
My wife, she got.

1289
01:05:23,196 --> 01:05:24,527
Your wife?
Sure.

1290
01:05:24,631 --> 01:05:26,690
Last night she say, "Pasqua,

1291
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,597
"all of the men
and all of the governments

1292
01:05:28,668 --> 01:05:30,932
<i>"in all of the world
should be put in jail".</i>

1293
01:05:31,004 --> 01:05:33,837
I said, "Maria, what for
you talk like a Communist"?

1294
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:35,771
She's, like, "Shut up!

1295
01:05:35,976 --> 01:05:37,944
"Do you know why
we got no peace?

1296
01:05:38,011 --> 01:05:40,377
<i>"Because we got no woman
in the government".</i>

1297
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,381
She said, "Put two roosters
together. What happens?

1298
01:05:43,483 --> 01:05:45,713
"Roosters got no brains,
they fight.

1299
01:05:46,053 --> 01:05:48,544
"Put 15 roosters together,
what happens?

1300
01:05:48,688 --> 01:05:50,087
"15 fight,

1301
01:05:50,157 --> 01:05:53,649
"but put 15 hens together
what do you got?

1302
01:05:53,727 --> 01:05:55,024
<i>"15 eggs".</i>

1303
01:05:55,228 --> 01:05:56,820
"Fight in the Congress",
she say,

1304
01:05:56,897 --> 01:05:57,955
"fight in London,

1305
01:05:58,031 --> 01:06:00,556
"fight in France, fight here,
fight there. Why?

1306
01:06:00,734 --> 01:06:02,531
"No hens in the government"!

1307
01:06:02,636 --> 01:06:05,867
So you want to become a
president? That's no solution.

1308
01:06:06,073 --> 01:06:07,199
Your wife.

1309
01:06:07,374 --> 01:06:10,571
That's a solution.

1310
01:06:11,211 --> 01:06:12,644
<i>Mannaggia!</i>

1311
01:06:25,892 --> 01:06:26,916
Grant.

1312
01:06:28,028 --> 01:06:29,495
Yoo-hoo.

1313
01:06:31,331 --> 01:06:32,730
Mr. Candidate?

1314
01:06:34,768 --> 01:06:37,362
Mr. President?
Yes?

1315
01:06:37,938 --> 01:06:39,200
That got him.

1316
01:06:41,241 --> 01:06:43,175
I just had the darndest dream.

1317
01:06:43,243 --> 01:06:45,040
All candidates
have that dream.

1318
01:06:45,112 --> 01:06:47,580
On your toes, Matthews.
That man is here.

1319
01:06:47,914 --> 01:06:50,246
Jim! Hello, Jim!
What are you doing here?

1320
01:06:50,317 --> 01:06:52,842
Hello, Grant. I thought I'd come
and bring you up to date on things.

1321
01:06:52,919 --> 01:06:54,910
Take my wife's solution.
His wife's what?

1322
01:06:54,988 --> 01:06:56,819
He thinks Mary
should run for president.

1323
01:06:56,890 --> 01:06:59,723
Oh, that's silly. No woman
could ever run for president.

1324
01:06:59,793 --> 01:07:01,954
She'd have to admit
she was over 35.

1325
01:07:02,028 --> 01:07:04,656
Politics certainly agrees with
you, Grant. You're looking very fit.

1326
01:07:04,731 --> 01:07:06,528
I'm feeling very fit.
And I mean very fit.

1327
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,465
Oh, dear, I wonder
if anything will fit.

1328
01:07:08,568 --> 01:07:10,195
You don't have much time
with Grant, Jim.

1329
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:11,259
I've got people lined up
for him to see.

1330
01:07:11,338 --> 01:07:12,396
Due any minute.

1331
01:07:12,472 --> 01:07:14,099
Want to read some of these?

1332
01:07:17,277 --> 01:07:20,246
Grant, what are you
talking about here tonight?

1333
01:07:20,313 --> 01:07:23,214
This is the last speech, Jim, it's
got a little bit of everything.

1334
01:07:23,283 --> 01:07:26,218
Anything controversial? Not
for anyone who agrees with him.

1335
01:07:26,286 --> 01:07:27,446
You've got to get
dressed, Grant. Yeah, yeah.

1336
01:07:27,554 --> 01:07:30,819
While you're dressing, have you got a
copy of the speech I could glance at?

1337
01:07:30,924 --> 01:07:33,688
Well, it really isn't a speech.
I'm just going to talk from notes.

1338
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,661
I turned off the radio. And you
put up the window, that's fine, son.

1339
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:39,927
Good night and thank you. You'd make a
good secretary of the Treasury. Good night.

1340
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,764
Say, if you really want to read
something, Jim, read this editorial.

1341
01:07:42,836 --> 01:07:44,360
And all those telegrams.

1342
01:07:44,437 --> 01:07:45,563
All of these?

1343
01:07:45,639 --> 01:07:47,402
They're just from people.

1344
01:07:48,675 --> 01:07:49,767
Just from people?

1345
01:07:49,943 --> 01:07:53,140
Yeah, you didn't find any of them
signed State Chairman, did you?

1346
01:07:53,246 --> 01:07:55,009
Grant, you're going
to be late.

1347
01:07:55,115 --> 01:07:58,573
You know after I'm President,
you're going to have to quit shoving.

1348
01:08:00,921 --> 01:08:04,015
See what I mean? I told you,
you sent the wrong dame along.

1349
01:08:04,124 --> 01:08:05,489
Yeah, it's a crime.

1350
01:08:05,592 --> 01:08:08,083
Boys in the Northwest, and
along the coast were behind him.

1351
01:08:08,161 --> 01:08:09,856
Then they had to stick out
his chin in Wichita.

1352
01:08:09,963 --> 01:08:12,124
How much damage has he
done? We may have lost labor.

1353
01:08:12,199 --> 01:08:13,962
I must've had 30 calls
after that last speech.

1354
01:08:14,034 --> 01:08:15,729
In New York,
Kay'll straighten him out.

1355
01:08:15,802 --> 01:08:17,292
She's got
the Indian sign on him.

1356
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:20,168
But that doesn't fix us up for
tonight. What're you afraid of tonight?

1357
01:08:21,374 --> 01:08:23,467
I don't know.
Only she's too doggone happy.

1358
01:08:23,543 --> 01:08:26,444
I think it's a good sign,
Jim coming down here.

1359
01:08:26,513 --> 01:08:28,504
Afraid somebody else will get
his place on the bandwagon.

1360
01:08:28,582 --> 01:08:30,812
Yeah, don't tell him what
you're talking about tonight.

1361
01:08:30,884 --> 01:08:32,249
Why not?
I don't know,

1362
01:08:32,352 --> 01:08:35,253
I don't like Jim turning up
all of a sudden like this.

1363
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:37,918
Don't
underestimate this guy, Jim.

1364
01:08:38,024 --> 01:08:39,958
People don't just come up
and shake hands with him.

1365
01:08:40,026 --> 01:08:41,516
They're up there
with a light in their eyes.

1366
01:08:41,595 --> 01:08:44,530
If he gets away from us, you may be
heading a "Stop Matthews" movement.

1367
01:08:44,598 --> 01:08:45,656
I don't want to stop him.

1368
01:08:45,732 --> 01:08:48,929
I know this Convention's gonna be a
rat race. I think we can nominate him.

1369
01:08:49,002 --> 01:08:50,264
If we can keep him in line.

1370
01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:52,167
Well, now I've got some
good news for you.

1371
01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:54,707
The guy's vulnerable, Jim.
He's got the bug.

1372
01:08:54,774 --> 01:08:56,264
How bad's he got it?

1373
01:08:56,509 --> 01:08:58,875
He's seeing himself
on statues already.

1374
01:08:58,945 --> 01:09:01,072
Then I think we'd better
tell him the facts of life.

1375
01:09:01,147 --> 01:09:02,842
Yeah, you do that, Jim.

1376
01:09:03,183 --> 01:09:04,207
Dinner!

1377
01:09:07,687 --> 01:09:09,587
Spike, you just
sang a symphony.

1378
01:09:09,689 --> 01:09:11,589
Grant, leave your
hall door open, will you?

1379
01:09:11,658 --> 01:09:12,750
I got a lot of people
coming in.

1380
01:09:12,826 --> 01:09:13,884
Okay.

1381
01:09:14,394 --> 01:09:15,520
Oh, you can eat mine, Jim.

1382
01:09:15,595 --> 01:09:17,460
Okay, here we go with the
first bunch of patriots.

1383
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:19,521
Remind Grant
they've got votes.

1384
01:09:19,599 --> 01:09:22,397
Spike does take the nobility
out of a crusade, doesn't he?

1385
01:09:22,469 --> 01:09:24,801
Am I supposed to be noble?
On my salary?

1386
01:09:25,138 --> 01:09:28,005
Mary, I can't go to this banquet
tonight, it might start talk.

1387
01:09:28,074 --> 01:09:30,440
What is the boy orator
giving out with tonight?

1388
01:09:30,777 --> 01:09:32,574
I have a much better idea.

1389
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,240
Hello. Hello,

1390
01:09:35,315 --> 01:09:38,648
would you have a radio sent
up to 2419 right away?

1391
01:09:38,785 --> 01:09:40,309
Thank you very much.

1392
01:09:40,587 --> 01:09:44,318
You better be good tonight,
Grant, Jim will be listening in.

1393
01:09:44,724 --> 01:09:47,158
Say, are you Grant Matthews?
Yeah.

1394
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:49,291
Let me
shake your hand.

1395
01:09:49,496 --> 01:09:50,963
Your speech was swell.

1396
01:09:51,064 --> 01:09:52,793
The best I ever read.
What's your name?

1397
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:54,491
Emil. Emil Breakesby.

1398
01:09:54,601 --> 01:09:56,228
I'm glad you're with us.
Been here long?

1399
01:09:56,303 --> 01:09:58,863
Yeah, long time, I inherited
the job from my father

1400
01:09:58,938 --> 01:09:59,927
at the old Cadillac.

1401
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:01,801
Married?
Yeah, four kids.

1402
01:10:01,908 --> 01:10:04,240
Kind of expensive these
days. Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

1403
01:10:04,311 --> 01:10:05,642
You're right about that.

1404
01:10:05,745 --> 01:10:07,804
Give it to them tonight,
Mr. Matthews.

1405
01:10:07,914 --> 01:10:09,313
All right, Emil, I will.

1406
01:10:09,416 --> 01:10:12,112
Hey, Grant, if you want to
rehearse that, try it out on me.

1407
01:10:12,185 --> 01:10:14,176
Well, I'll give you
the start of it.

1408
01:10:14,321 --> 01:10:17,449
"Ladies and members of the
Industrial Council of Detroit.

1409
01:10:17,524 --> 01:10:19,355
"What is the biggest
single question

1410
01:10:19,426 --> 01:10:21,621
"facing the American public
today?"

1411
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:23,162
Who's with onions?

1412
01:10:26,499 --> 01:10:28,364
I guess I'm with onions.

1413
01:10:29,536 --> 01:10:31,299
Grant, your public is waiting.

1414
01:10:31,371 --> 01:10:34,340
My hamburger is waiting.
Hamburgers don't vote.

1415
01:10:35,175 --> 01:10:36,335
These are dairy farmers.

1416
01:10:36,443 --> 01:10:38,673
Just a little talk, cows,
butter, American cheese.

1417
01:10:38,778 --> 01:10:40,541
What do I know
about American cheese?

1418
01:10:40,647 --> 01:10:43,172
Walk this way and meet
three perfect specimens.

1419
01:10:43,283 --> 01:10:45,649
And remember, Grant,
they've got votes.

1420
01:10:48,455 --> 01:10:50,286
Now I'll set them up
in the other alley.

1421
01:10:50,357 --> 01:10:52,655
Well, Jim,
what's the State of the Union?

1422
01:10:52,726 --> 01:10:54,318
What are your reports
on Grant?

1423
01:10:54,394 --> 01:10:56,453
First, let me give you
my reports on you.

1424
01:10:56,529 --> 01:10:58,997
You've done a great job.
I want to congratulate you.

1425
01:10:59,065 --> 01:11:02,159
I'd like to admit something. I've
enjoyed it, every minute of it.

1426
01:11:02,402 --> 01:11:04,563
Jim, Grant's got something.

1427
01:11:04,738 --> 01:11:06,330
Don't try to
take it away from him.

1428
01:11:06,406 --> 01:11:09,842
When he's just cockeyed drunk with
sincerity, people can't resist him.

1429
01:11:09,909 --> 01:11:11,376
Sounds as though
you couldn't either.

1430
01:11:11,478 --> 01:11:14,003
Oh, no. The state of our union
is strictly political.

1431
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,014
I thought I saw Grant throw
you a look or two tonight

1432
01:11:16,082 --> 01:11:18,346
that wasn't
entirely political.

1433
01:11:18,418 --> 01:11:20,147
You're a bachelor,
aren't you, Jim?

1434
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:21,585
Theoretically. Why?

1435
01:11:21,688 --> 01:11:25,215
Well, if you were married, you'd know that
there were little things that sort of...

1436
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:26,451
Well, for instance,

1437
01:11:26,526 --> 01:11:30,587
when Grant found out once that the
girls at school used to call me Maizie.

1438
01:11:30,663 --> 01:11:32,028
He knew I hated it.

1439
01:11:32,098 --> 01:11:35,431
So sometimes, he used to call
me Maizie just to tease me.

1440
01:11:35,535 --> 01:11:38,231
Well, Maizie doesn't
live here anymore.

1441
01:11:38,538 --> 01:11:41,029
Another thing, he always
hated to hear me swear.

1442
01:11:41,107 --> 01:11:43,166
Whenever I let go with
something, he used to

1443
01:11:43,243 --> 01:11:45,143
smack me on my sitter, hard.

1444
01:11:45,412 --> 01:11:48,745
I've done a lot of swearing
on this trip. And no smacks?

1445
01:11:48,882 --> 01:11:50,577
It's a small request,

1446
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:53,947
but I'd give anything for one
good smack on my south end.

1447
01:11:54,053 --> 01:11:57,147
I certainly wish that I could
do something about that.

1448
01:11:58,024 --> 01:12:00,049
Well, how's
the farmers' choice?

1449
01:12:00,293 --> 01:12:03,262
Say, after the beautiful things
I've just said about cows,

1450
01:12:03,463 --> 01:12:05,590
I certainly feel guilty
eating this hamburger.

1451
01:12:05,698 --> 01:12:08,030
It's like eating
one's dearest friend.

1452
01:12:08,568 --> 01:12:11,935
Back to the pasture. Wipe off your
feet and come in to meet the A.F. of L.

1453
01:12:12,038 --> 01:12:14,438
You give me time to eat!
Yeah, let him eat.

1454
01:12:14,541 --> 01:12:17,704
This is a crisis. I have to know
you're holding the A.F. of L. in there

1455
01:12:17,777 --> 01:12:19,677
while I sneak the C.I.O.
into the other bedroom.

1456
01:12:19,746 --> 01:12:22,044
Well, put them both in the same
room, and I'll talk to them.

1457
01:12:22,115 --> 01:12:23,707
Little boy blue,
haven't you heard?

1458
01:12:23,783 --> 01:12:26,513
They ain't keeping
steady company anymore.

1459
01:12:26,586 --> 01:12:28,053
I'm serious about that.

1460
01:12:28,121 --> 01:12:30,487
You tell those fellows in
there the C.I.O. are coming in,

1461
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:33,058
then I'll come in and talk to
both of them at the same time.

1462
01:12:33,126 --> 01:12:34,252
You're just
asking for trouble.

1463
01:12:34,327 --> 01:12:35,885
I don't mind you having
your head in the clouds

1464
01:12:35,962 --> 01:12:37,930
but I wish you'd keep
your feet in the voting booth.

1465
01:12:37,997 --> 01:12:41,330
Those men are the kind who are
responsible for the wildcat strikes.

1466
01:12:41,434 --> 01:12:43,834
If I can make them see something
bigger than their own jobs

1467
01:12:43,903 --> 01:12:45,165
as head of their own locals

1468
01:12:45,238 --> 01:12:47,263
and what power they get
from that... There may be...

1469
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:48,637
You shut up!
Keep out of this.

1470
01:12:48,741 --> 01:12:50,265
That's one of the things
I came to talk about.

1471
01:12:50,343 --> 01:12:52,675
Your Wichita speech killed off
most of the labor leaders.

1472
01:12:52,779 --> 01:12:54,474
I know, 'cause I talked to them. Why?

1473
01:12:54,581 --> 01:12:56,173
What did I say to them?

1474
01:12:56,282 --> 01:12:58,773
I just said when the members
stop running the unions,

1475
01:12:58,852 --> 01:13:00,410
the unions
start running the members.

1476
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,385
Good heavens, Jim,
I'm for labor!

1477
01:13:02,455 --> 01:13:05,424
Sure. Everybody's for labor. That's
like saying you're against sin.

1478
01:13:05,492 --> 01:13:07,153
The labor leaders don't
think you're for them.

1479
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:10,991
Not after that crack that they're
responsible for the Taft-Hartley Law.

1480
01:13:11,097 --> 01:13:14,533
No dice. They're even mad they're
in the same hotel together.

1481
01:13:14,634 --> 01:13:15,692
That makes me mad.

1482
01:13:15,802 --> 01:13:18,430
<i>Watch out for the little guy
they call "Mac".</i>

1483
01:13:20,006 --> 01:13:22,031
Now for some
counter-espionage.

1484
01:13:23,209 --> 01:13:26,042
Jim, how can you
say that Grant offended labor?

1485
01:13:26,179 --> 01:13:29,444
That Wichita audience was
full of cheering union men.

1486
01:13:29,816 --> 01:13:32,649
Union members might cheer, but it's
the leaders that swing the delegates

1487
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:33,777
and they're sore.

1488
01:13:33,853 --> 01:13:36,151
Don't you want Grant
to be a good president?

1489
01:13:36,256 --> 01:13:38,451
Mary, a good president
is one who gets elected.

1490
01:13:40,326 --> 01:13:41,793
The Eastern Front's ready.

1491
01:13:42,428 --> 01:13:45,522
C.I.O. still in there? And
in what I call an ugly mood.

1492
01:13:45,765 --> 01:13:48,996
Jim, turn your back.
This way, gentlemen.

1493
01:14:06,286 --> 01:14:09,016
You know, Grant might be able
to unite the United Nations.

1494
01:14:11,457 --> 01:14:12,924
Open up, in there!

1495
01:14:13,726 --> 01:14:16,456
Open up there! Where is
that Grant Matthews guy?

1496
01:14:17,196 --> 01:14:18,561
Who're you?
My name is...

1497
01:14:18,631 --> 01:14:19,859
My name is Sam Parrish,

1498
01:14:19,933 --> 01:14:22,629
Chairman of Banquet Committee,
bosom friend of Grant...

1499
01:14:22,735 --> 01:14:24,134
Mary!
Sam.

1500
01:14:25,738 --> 01:14:28,571
Bless your heart.
You're just as pretty as ever.

1501
01:14:29,442 --> 01:14:31,103
I could eat you with a spoon.

1502
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:33,440
Why, Jim Conover, you
old son of a gun. Hi, Sam.

1503
01:14:33,546 --> 01:14:35,309
What're you doing here?
Take it easy.

1504
01:14:35,415 --> 01:14:37,178
You're the only man in
Detroit who knows I am here.

1505
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:38,911
Can't you wait outside?
Excuse me.

1506
01:14:38,985 --> 01:14:40,953
What's going on
here, anyway?

1507
01:14:41,054 --> 01:14:43,386
Say, darn it,
I might've known.

1508
01:14:43,456 --> 01:14:44,548
Jim, you're psychic.

1509
01:14:44,624 --> 01:14:47,218
I was primed to come to
Washington to sell you the idea

1510
01:14:47,293 --> 01:14:50,194
we need a businessman like Grant in
the White House. You beat me to it.

1511
01:14:50,263 --> 01:14:52,663
Where is Grant? That's
a date, and bring cash.

1512
01:14:52,732 --> 01:14:54,597
Sam.
Grant!

1513
01:14:54,667 --> 01:14:57,500
When the walls started to
shake, I knew you were here.

1514
01:14:57,604 --> 01:14:59,970
Still alive? Yeah, I'm
still alive. So are they.

1515
01:15:00,039 --> 01:15:02,200
Matter of fact,
the A.F. of L. just invited

1516
01:15:02,275 --> 01:15:03,537
the C.I.O.
to have a glass of beer.

1517
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:05,077
Under whose jurisdiction?

1518
01:15:05,144 --> 01:15:06,702
The Midtown Bar and Grill.

1519
01:15:09,949 --> 01:15:12,247
You got everything ready
for tonight, Sam?

1520
01:15:12,318 --> 01:15:14,786
Ready? Why, there'll be more money
per square inch at that banquet

1521
01:15:14,854 --> 01:15:15,946
than there is in the Mint.

1522
01:15:16,022 --> 01:15:18,183
Mary, you go right home
and start packing.

1523
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:20,486
You're moving
into the White House.

1524
01:15:20,793 --> 01:15:22,852
I never was so happy
in my life.

1525
01:15:22,996 --> 01:15:24,793
Looks like our turn's
come again.

1526
01:15:24,864 --> 01:15:27,924
Wait till you hear my speech
tonight. You may not be so happy.

1527
01:15:28,001 --> 01:15:29,127
What do you mean
by that?

1528
01:15:29,202 --> 01:15:30,760
Last time
I was in New York,

1529
01:15:30,837 --> 01:15:34,364
Grant and I had a knock-down, drag-out
fight about tax reduction and inflation.

1530
01:15:34,474 --> 01:15:38,001
Is that what you're talking about
tonight? Grant talks like a radical.

1531
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:41,274
But any man who's made as much money
as he has is a good sound American.

1532
01:15:41,347 --> 01:15:43,042
Well, see you later, fella.

1533
01:15:43,149 --> 01:15:46,141
Tell you what. Take another
good sock at labor tonight,

1534
01:15:46,219 --> 01:15:47,982
you'll make a real hit.

1535
01:15:48,054 --> 01:15:51,285
Doggone it, Mary. I'll be
telling people I knew you when.

1536
01:15:51,357 --> 01:15:52,688
Who're you?
Well, my name...

1537
01:15:52,792 --> 01:15:54,953
Let me out of here.

1538
01:15:55,161 --> 01:15:57,789
Hey, wait,
going down? Mary.

1539
01:16:00,867 --> 01:16:03,301
Spike, don't you dare
do that.

1540
01:16:03,369 --> 01:16:06,702
All right, I can starve. But
that's the way to make communists.

1541
01:16:12,245 --> 01:16:14,839
I wonder what
a hot hamburger tastes like.

1542
01:16:14,914 --> 01:16:17,474
Grant, you expect me to
run your campaign for you?

1543
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:20,678
Have I any choice in that?
You certainly have.

1544
01:16:20,753 --> 01:16:22,243
But if I'm to stay
in the picture,

1545
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:26,284
I want to know what you're planning to
say here tonight. I have a right to know.

1546
01:16:26,359 --> 01:16:27,519
Why, Jim, you can know.

1547
01:16:27,593 --> 01:16:30,892
I'm going to tell them that they
do a lot of yapping about communism

1548
01:16:30,997 --> 01:16:34,160
but as long as they think about high
profits instead of high production,

1549
01:16:34,233 --> 01:16:35,666
they're playing
the communists' game.

1550
01:16:35,735 --> 01:16:37,760
High production is the way
to kill high prices.

1551
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:41,169
They want high prices.
High prices mean inflation.

1552
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,572
Inflation today
means depression tomorrow.

1553
01:16:43,676 --> 01:16:45,667
And a depression
in these United States

1554
01:16:45,745 --> 01:16:48,111
is exactly the ace card
Moscow is waiting to draw.

1555
01:16:48,214 --> 01:16:51,081
They don't want to hear these
things. They're gonna hear them.

1556
01:16:51,184 --> 01:16:53,880
They're gonna hear that capitalism
itself is being challenged.

1557
01:16:53,953 --> 01:16:56,114
If it doesn't survive, it's
because men like themselves

1558
01:16:56,222 --> 01:16:58,122
haven't the guts or
imagination to make it survive.

1559
01:16:58,224 --> 01:17:00,715
You can't talk to that crowd
this way. You'll antagonize them.

1560
01:17:00,793 --> 01:17:02,954
All right. So what?
So I'll antagonize them.

1561
01:17:03,062 --> 01:17:05,895
I yelled my head off about
labor and its responsibilities.

1562
01:17:05,965 --> 01:17:08,399
I'm going to lay it right on
the line for industry, too.

1563
01:17:08,468 --> 01:17:09,696
Now, look here, Jim,

1564
01:17:09,869 --> 01:17:11,393
you know just as well as I do

1565
01:17:11,471 --> 01:17:13,530
that there are men at that
banquet who'll be rooting

1566
01:17:13,606 --> 01:17:16,598
for a depression, just so they
can slap labor's ears back.

1567
01:17:16,709 --> 01:17:20,770
And I suppose you have a few well-chosen
words to say about tax reduction.

1568
01:17:21,647 --> 01:17:23,581
You better not worry so much
about tax reduction

1569
01:17:23,649 --> 01:17:26,948
until we accomplish some of the
things we have to accomplish.

1570
01:17:27,754 --> 01:17:31,190
I'm going to tell them that the
wealthiest nation in the world is a failure

1571
01:17:31,257 --> 01:17:33,623
unless it's also the
healthiest nation in the world.

1572
01:17:33,726 --> 01:17:36,456
That means the highest medical
care for the lowest income groups.

1573
01:17:36,562 --> 01:17:38,393
And that goes
for housing, too.

1574
01:17:38,865 --> 01:17:41,026
One thing this nation
is not rich enough to afford

1575
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:43,000
is not having
a roof over our heads.

1576
01:17:43,736 --> 01:17:47,137
And I'm going to tell them that the
American Dream is not making money.

1577
01:17:47,206 --> 01:17:49,367
It is the well-being and
the freedom of the individual

1578
01:17:49,442 --> 01:17:50,568
throughout the world

1579
01:17:50,643 --> 01:17:52,770
from Patagonia to Detroit.

1580
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:56,806
We can't be an island of
plenty in a world of starvation.

1581
01:17:57,316 --> 01:18:01,252
We have to send food,
clothing, machinery, and money

1582
01:18:01,654 --> 01:18:04,817
to the bitter, impoverished
people of the world.

1583
01:18:05,124 --> 01:18:07,524
Try to recreate
their self-respect.

1584
01:18:08,027 --> 01:18:11,190
Give them the desire again
for individual freedom.

1585
01:18:11,297 --> 01:18:15,324
And I'm gonna tell them that as long
as dictatorships remain in the world,

1586
01:18:15,434 --> 01:18:17,425
we better remain well-armed.

1587
01:18:17,503 --> 01:18:20,563
Because the next time, we're not
going to get two years to get ready.

1588
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,938
They're gonna
jump us overnight.

1589
01:18:23,476 --> 01:18:26,445
And I'm gonna tell them that
there's only one government

1590
01:18:26,512 --> 01:18:29,675
which is capable of handling
the atomic control,

1591
01:18:30,149 --> 01:18:35,348
world disarmament, world employment,
world peace, and that's a world government.

1592
01:18:36,322 --> 01:18:39,814
The people of 13 states started
the United States of America.

1593
01:18:40,393 --> 01:18:41,951
I think the people
of that many nations

1594
01:18:42,028 --> 01:18:44,826
are now ready to start
a United States of the World.

1595
01:18:44,897 --> 01:18:46,558
With or without Russia.

1596
01:18:46,666 --> 01:18:49,829
And I mean a "United" States
of the World.

1597
01:18:49,902 --> 01:18:51,733
With one Bill of Rights.

1598
01:18:51,838 --> 01:18:53,806
One international law.

1599
01:18:53,873 --> 01:18:57,707
One international currency.
One international citizenship.

1600
01:18:58,477 --> 01:19:00,945
And, I'm going to tell them
that the brotherhood of man

1601
01:19:01,013 --> 01:19:03,811
is not just an idealist dream,

1602
01:19:03,883 --> 01:19:07,216
but a practical necessity
if man is going to survive.

1603
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,311
And I'm...
Where're you going?

1604
01:19:09,388 --> 01:19:12,084
I'm going out to get pie-eyed,
then I'm going back to Washington.

1605
01:19:12,191 --> 01:19:13,488
You're walking out on me?

1606
01:19:13,559 --> 01:19:16,494
If you're going to climb out on a limb
like that and saw it off behind you.

1607
01:19:16,562 --> 01:19:17,790
Let me remind you.

1608
01:19:17,864 --> 01:19:21,095
Up to now, you haven't got one
pledged delegate to that Convention.

1609
01:19:21,167 --> 01:19:23,067
You know how many you need
to be nominated?

1610
01:19:23,202 --> 01:19:25,762
About 550.
Think that over.

1611
01:19:25,872 --> 01:19:27,339
You've already
scared off big labor

1612
01:19:27,406 --> 01:19:29,601
and if you scare off big
business, you're a dead duck.

1613
01:19:29,709 --> 01:19:32,200
They've got to know where I stand.
I told you that at the start.

1614
01:19:32,278 --> 01:19:35,042
I've got to be on record,
nomination or no nomination.

1615
01:19:35,114 --> 01:19:38,174
All right, but not here! Not tonight.
Not when you're on a radio hook-up.

1616
01:19:38,251 --> 01:19:40,549
Give it sometime when you're
out in Nebraska or Oklahoma.

1617
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:43,612
It's for you, Jim.
I'll go air out Parlor B.

1618
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:46,015
Hello. Oh.
Hello, how are you?

1619
01:19:46,592 --> 01:19:47,650
Where are you?

1620
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:49,919
Fine, I'll come up
to your room.

1621
01:19:50,096 --> 01:19:52,792
Excuse me a minute.
Grant, I'll be right back.

1622
01:19:55,201 --> 01:19:57,101
I just wanted to tell you
the gang in the kitchen

1623
01:19:57,169 --> 01:19:58,727
are all listening in tonight,
Mr. Matthews.

1624
01:19:58,804 --> 01:20:00,931
Oh, oh, fine.
Fine, Emil, you do that.

1625
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:04,942
Down there they say you're not just
another one of those politicians.

1626
01:20:05,244 --> 01:20:08,577
You're not, are you, Mr.
Matthews? No, I'm not.

1627
01:20:08,648 --> 01:20:11,708
I knew it. Give it to them tonight,
Mr. Matthews. Give it to them.

1628
01:20:15,655 --> 01:20:18,920
I'm sorry Jim got a line on what
you're going to say here tonight.

1629
01:20:18,991 --> 01:20:21,721
So am I. I was all pepped up
about that speech tonight.

1630
01:20:21,794 --> 01:20:22,920
You're not gonna change it?

1631
01:20:22,995 --> 01:20:24,860
I don't know.
Jim's only argument is

1632
01:20:24,931 --> 01:20:27,161
that this isn't the place
to say it. I've...

1633
01:20:27,233 --> 01:20:29,895
Do you think he's right? It
isn't whether Jim's right or not.

1634
01:20:29,969 --> 01:20:32,961
It's just that there is no
such thing as a little garlic.

1635
01:20:33,339 --> 01:20:35,500
You haven't
answered my question.

1636
01:20:35,608 --> 01:20:39,339
Grant, do you remember what made the biggest
impression on that audience in Wichita?

1637
01:20:39,445 --> 01:20:41,640
It was when you said
the real wealth of the world

1638
01:20:41,747 --> 01:20:44,409
is not in coal or iron
or bank accounts.

1639
01:20:44,483 --> 01:20:47,077
It's in principle,
integrity, honesty.

1640
01:20:47,153 --> 01:20:50,179
Plain, ordinary,
garden-variety honesty.

1641
01:20:50,356 --> 01:20:52,256
Do you remember that?

1642
01:20:53,159 --> 01:20:55,218
Well, should I change it,
or should I not?

1643
01:20:55,294 --> 01:20:59,128
No, the world needs honest men
today, more than it needs presidents.

1644
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,428
Okay, let's go.
Come on, let's go...

1645
01:21:03,502 --> 01:21:06,096
Hold it a minute, Grant.
About your speech tonight.

1646
01:21:06,172 --> 01:21:08,197
Some of the smartest boys
in Washington got together

1647
01:21:08,274 --> 01:21:12,108
and prepared something for you to
say. They know what they're doing.

1648
01:21:13,479 --> 01:21:15,970
"The palsied hand
of bureaucratic control

1649
01:21:16,048 --> 01:21:17,811
<i>"must be removed
from the throttle of..."</i>

1650
01:21:17,883 --> 01:21:20,113
What is this? A gag?
No. Why?

1651
01:21:20,486 --> 01:21:23,649
"Industry is not a felon. It
can no longer be treated as one.

1652
01:21:23,723 --> 01:21:25,748
<i>"The binding shackles
of government..."</i>

1653
01:21:25,891 --> 01:21:29,224
Why, this is double-talk. What
you were planning was trouble-talk.

1654
01:21:29,295 --> 01:21:31,456
Confound it, man! Don't
you want to be president?

1655
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:33,964
Yes, I want to be president.
Let me get you nominated!

1656
01:21:34,033 --> 01:21:35,864
How about letting the
people get him nominated?

1657
01:21:35,968 --> 01:21:38,129
The people have darn little
to say about the nominations.

1658
01:21:38,204 --> 01:21:39,728
You both lived in this
country all of your lives.

1659
01:21:39,805 --> 01:21:41,568
It's time you get that
through your heads.

1660
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:42,800
You're not nominated
by the people,

1661
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:44,536
you're nominated
by the politicians.

1662
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:48,068
Why? Because the people are too
darn lazy to vote in the primaries.

1663
01:21:48,147 --> 01:21:49,478
Well, politicians
aren't lazy.

1664
01:21:49,548 --> 01:21:50,947
I'll put Grant
in the White House,

1665
01:21:51,017 --> 01:21:52,507
if you and he
give me half a chance.

1666
01:21:52,585 --> 01:21:53,779
Use your head, Grant.

1667
01:21:53,853 --> 01:21:56,151
We've got to bring you into that
Convention without any enemies.

1668
01:21:56,222 --> 01:21:57,314
That's the whole strategy.

1669
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:59,324
Nomination
or no nomination, Jim,

1670
01:21:59,392 --> 01:22:02,122
they've got to know where I
stand before they vote for me.

1671
01:22:02,194 --> 01:22:03,218
Grant.

1672
01:22:05,531 --> 01:22:08,329
I hate to do this to you, Grant,
but there's one more delegation.

1673
01:22:08,401 --> 01:22:10,266
Oh, no. Tell them I've left.
You can't do that.

1674
01:22:10,369 --> 01:22:13,065
They'll see you on your way
out. These are important VIPs.

1675
01:22:13,172 --> 01:22:15,504
We're the guests of honor.
Yeah, I'll cut it short.

1676
01:22:15,574 --> 01:22:18,338
I'll go out and strew
the path with flowers.

1677
01:22:20,279 --> 01:22:22,747
Mary, I want
to tell you right now,

1678
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:24,440
if Grant blasts
that group tonight,

1679
01:22:24,550 --> 01:22:26,745
he'll be blasting himself out of
any chance for the White House.

1680
01:22:26,819 --> 01:22:28,286
He's got to take
professional advice.

1681
01:22:28,354 --> 01:22:31,221
Jim, let him alone. He's just trying
to tell the truth as he sees it.

1682
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:33,190
It doesn't matter whether
he becomes president or not.

1683
01:22:33,259 --> 01:22:34,590
Doesn't matter?
No, not that much.

1684
01:22:34,693 --> 01:22:36,285
I know that man
and I love that man.

1685
01:22:36,395 --> 01:22:39,193
And I tell you, if you get him
to compromise, you'll destroy him.

1686
01:22:39,265 --> 01:22:42,598
Compromise will eat into him like a
worm. He won't be Grant Matthews anymore.

1687
01:22:42,701 --> 01:22:45,067
I hate to be blunt,
but as a political advisor,

1688
01:22:45,137 --> 01:22:46,661
you are a wonderful
wife and mother.

1689
01:22:46,739 --> 01:22:49,037
And as a wife and mother,
I'd like to tell you

1690
01:22:49,108 --> 01:22:51,338
that Grant doesn't need
politicians like you.

1691
01:22:51,410 --> 01:22:53,640
You're trying to
make him believe that he does

1692
01:22:53,746 --> 01:22:55,373
so that you can ride in
on his coattails.

1693
01:22:55,448 --> 01:22:57,575
I know where you stand, Jim.

1694
01:22:57,650 --> 01:22:59,709
You and Kay Thorndyke

1695
01:22:59,785 --> 01:23:01,116
and Emil, the waiter here.

1696
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:04,280
The man who elects the presidents.
He knows where you stand, too.

1697
01:23:04,356 --> 01:23:06,790
He can smell a compromise
a mile off. Come in.

1698
01:23:06,859 --> 01:23:08,417
Let him alone.
Just let him tell the truth.

1699
01:23:08,494 --> 01:23:10,860
You got an honest man. You
don't know how lucky you are.

1700
01:23:10,963 --> 01:23:12,931
I got your radio. Had to
steal it from another room.

1701
01:23:12,998 --> 01:23:14,329
Yes, plug it in please.

1702
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,732
Everybody wanted a radio tonight. So?

1703
01:23:16,802 --> 01:23:20,135
A big broadcast from Hollywood.
Bob Hope and Jack Benny.

1704
01:23:20,339 --> 01:23:21,772
All set.
The elevator's waiting.

1705
01:23:21,841 --> 01:23:24,639
Fix your tie, Grant.
Listen in, Jim.

1706
01:23:30,182 --> 01:23:32,446
My bag, my bag. My...
What's that in your hand?

1707
01:23:32,518 --> 01:23:34,076
Oh, that's my bag.

1708
01:23:45,698 --> 01:23:48,531
May as well sit in here and
be comfortable. I have a radio.

1709
01:23:56,041 --> 01:23:58,305
Dare I listen?
You can listen.

1710
01:23:58,944 --> 01:24:01,003
Are you sure? You were
only with him a few minutes.

1711
01:24:01,113 --> 01:24:02,512
And Mary's had weeks, I know.

1712
01:24:02,615 --> 01:24:06,016
It wasn't hard, Jim. All I did was to
tell him the things he wanted to hear.

1713
01:24:06,118 --> 01:24:09,281
But there is one question on his
mind you'd better have the answer for.

1714
01:24:09,355 --> 01:24:10,447
What's that?

1715
01:24:10,523 --> 01:24:12,787
He's beginning to wonder
if there's any difference

1716
01:24:12,858 --> 01:24:14,655
between the Democratic party
and the Republican party.

1717
01:24:14,727 --> 01:24:17,525
That's a fine question for a
presidential candidate to ask.

1718
01:24:17,630 --> 01:24:21,191
There's all the difference in the
world. They're in and we're out.

1719
01:24:29,842 --> 01:24:32,003
Well, this is more like it.

1720
01:24:32,077 --> 01:24:34,170
These telegrams
aren't just from people.

1721
01:24:34,246 --> 01:24:35,508
You see what that speech did?

1722
01:24:35,581 --> 01:24:37,071
Boy, happy days
are here again.

1723
01:24:37,183 --> 01:24:39,549
Hey, Brock from Missouri
and Tenebaum, Colorado.

1724
01:24:39,652 --> 01:24:42,143
Those birds don't send telegrams
unless they're fishing for bids.

1725
01:24:42,221 --> 01:24:45,213
I thought they were Dewey men.
Not now. Hey, look at this.

1726
01:24:45,324 --> 01:24:47,155
Ed Lauterback wants
to talk turkey.

1727
01:24:47,226 --> 01:24:50,354
That puts the farm block on our team.
Thirty delegates, if it means one.

1728
01:24:50,429 --> 01:24:53,330
Look here, Mary. Two state
and seven county chairmen.

1729
01:24:53,399 --> 01:24:55,196
Not just from people.

1730
01:24:55,267 --> 01:24:57,963
I don't want to hear anymore
about that speech last night.

1731
01:24:58,070 --> 01:25:00,630
These telegrams prove that Jim is
right. He knows what he's doing.

1732
01:25:00,739 --> 01:25:01,899
He's a professional.

1733
01:25:01,974 --> 01:25:04,340
And I don't want to hear that
Henry Clay routine either.

1734
01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:07,106
He wound up being neither
right nor president.

1735
01:25:07,279 --> 01:25:09,543
Emil, the waiter,
was listening in.

1736
01:25:09,648 --> 01:25:12,116
I can imagine
the look on his face.

1737
01:25:13,619 --> 01:25:16,281
Mary. Mary, you should
have faith in me.

1738
01:25:16,922 --> 01:25:18,549
I want to be president.

1739
01:25:18,624 --> 01:25:21,593
I know this country.
I know it inside out.

1740
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:23,787
I know all of
its simmering hates.

1741
01:25:23,896 --> 01:25:26,421
I know the petty warfare
undermining our unity.

1742
01:25:26,498 --> 01:25:28,329
And I think I know
what causes it.

1743
01:25:28,434 --> 01:25:30,902
It's fear.
It's nothing but fear.

1744
01:25:30,970 --> 01:25:33,063
Fear of the future.
Fear of the world.

1745
01:25:33,138 --> 01:25:35,698
Fear of communism.
Fear of going broke.

1746
01:25:35,774 --> 01:25:37,742
Why didn't you make
that speech last night?

1747
01:25:37,810 --> 01:25:39,744
Because I want the nomination.

1748
01:25:39,812 --> 01:25:42,406
If I have to soft soap a few
idiots like Sam Parrish to get it,

1749
01:25:42,481 --> 01:25:43,948
I'll soft soap them.

1750
01:25:44,016 --> 01:25:46,576
After I'm elected, if you think
I'm going off the deep end,

1751
01:25:46,652 --> 01:25:47,914
come and tell me.

1752
01:25:47,987 --> 01:25:50,581
I'll listen to you.
But until then, lay off.

1753
01:25:50,656 --> 01:25:52,123
There's not going
to be any then.

1754
01:25:52,191 --> 01:25:54,318
Up until last night,
you had something to say.

1755
01:25:54,426 --> 01:25:57,293
You had courage. You had a
chance. The people were for you.

1756
01:25:57,363 --> 01:26:00,594
But not anymore. You've
changed and they'll know it.

1757
01:26:00,666 --> 01:26:02,258
I haven't changed.

1758
01:26:02,334 --> 01:26:04,495
Hey, boss,
we got company again.

1759
01:26:05,304 --> 01:26:06,328
Uh-oh.

1760
01:26:07,206 --> 01:26:10,664
James, you are about to become
an older and wiser man.

1761
01:26:11,277 --> 01:26:13,541
Ask Grant
if he's too old to fly.

1762
01:26:13,646 --> 01:26:16,308
Hey, boss, Rusty wants to know
if you're too old to fly.

1763
01:26:16,382 --> 01:26:20,011
You tell Rusty I'm busy. And tell
him if he knows what's good for him,

1764
01:26:20,085 --> 01:26:22,918
he'll get down to that plant
and get busy himself.

1765
01:26:24,857 --> 01:26:26,722
Scram, fellas. The chill's on.

1766
01:26:27,993 --> 01:26:29,017
Uh-oh.

1767
01:26:32,698 --> 01:26:35,428
I amaze myself.
But I'm disappointed.

1768
01:26:36,001 --> 01:26:39,368
Okay, Jim, I've made my decision.
From now on, it's your show.

1769
01:26:39,438 --> 01:26:41,167
I'll talk turkey
with Lauterback.

1770
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:42,332
I'll play ball with anybody

1771
01:26:42,408 --> 01:26:44,171
who'll help me get the
nomination. Is that clear?

1772
01:26:44,243 --> 01:26:46,575
And money's no object. I'll
spend $1 million if I have to.

1773
01:26:46,679 --> 01:26:48,112
Grant, watch us go
from here.

1774
01:26:48,213 --> 01:26:49,475
Where's Lauterback, in Washington? Yeah.

1775
01:26:49,548 --> 01:26:50,845
Get him on that phone.

1776
01:26:50,916 --> 01:26:53,885
Ed, you know Grant will never fight
the farm block. It's too powerful.

1777
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:55,544
I don't
beat about the bush, Jim.

1778
01:26:55,621 --> 01:26:58,454
I'm anti Cuban sugar,
anti Mexican cotton,

1779
01:26:58,557 --> 01:27:01,458
anti Argentine beef,
anti Canadian wheat,

1780
01:27:01,527 --> 01:27:03,188
anti free-trade of any kind.

1781
01:27:03,262 --> 01:27:04,889
Are you for anything?

1782
01:27:04,963 --> 01:27:08,057
Yes, I'm for Ed Lauterback,
same as you're for...

1783
01:27:08,133 --> 01:27:10,192
Grant Matthews.
Yes.

1784
01:27:10,269 --> 01:27:12,464
How many delegates can
you deliver? Deliver?

1785
01:27:12,571 --> 01:27:14,801
None. I only influence.

1786
01:27:14,907 --> 01:27:17,432
Well, how many can you
influence? Perhaps none.

1787
01:27:17,543 --> 01:27:19,306
Let's have it, Ed.
What do want to nick us for?

1788
01:27:19,411 --> 01:27:21,276
I name the Secretary
of Agriculture.

1789
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:22,904
You have delusions
of grandeur.

1790
01:27:22,981 --> 01:27:24,573
You want my support?
And we'll pay for it.

1791
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:26,914
You can approve the appointment,
but you can't make it.

1792
01:27:26,985 --> 01:27:29,419
Good enough. Right of vetoes, good enough.

1793
01:27:35,928 --> 01:27:39,125
Have you talked to Bill Green,
Phil Murray, or John L. Lewis?

1794
01:27:39,198 --> 01:27:40,597
We're talking to you now.

1795
01:27:40,666 --> 01:27:43,260
Which isn't easy because I
don't like you, Bill Hardy.

1796
01:27:43,335 --> 01:27:44,359
That's mutual.

1797
01:27:44,470 --> 01:27:47,496
Who cares who likes who?
How many men in your union?

1798
01:27:47,606 --> 01:27:50,837
700,000 in my locals,
scattered over four states.

1799
01:27:50,943 --> 01:27:52,376
Pivotal states.

1800
01:27:52,478 --> 01:27:54,844
And they vote
in the primaries.

1801
01:27:54,947 --> 01:27:56,642
Can you work out a deal
with Jim?

1802
01:27:56,715 --> 01:27:59,275
I can always make a deal
with Jim. Well, work it out.

1803
01:28:03,555 --> 01:28:06,388
Can you deliver delegates from
the foreign-born sections?

1804
01:28:06,492 --> 01:28:08,983
Let me handle things
and I can.

1805
01:28:09,061 --> 01:28:11,552
These people
never vote for anything.

1806
01:28:11,663 --> 01:28:13,153
They vote against something.

1807
01:28:13,232 --> 01:28:16,395
They've carried hatreds around
for centuries.

1808
01:28:16,502 --> 01:28:19,164
The trick is to play
on these hatreds,

1809
01:28:19,238 --> 01:28:21,638
one nationality
against the other,

1810
01:28:21,707 --> 01:28:23,072
keep them voting as blocks.

1811
01:28:23,175 --> 01:28:25,905
We know how you do it. You're a
powerful woman. What's your price?

1812
01:28:26,011 --> 01:28:28,343
Patronage. Lots of patronage.

1813
01:28:28,414 --> 01:28:31,713
I dish it out to my friends.
That's my price.

1814
01:28:31,817 --> 01:28:33,580
To Republicans or Democrats.

1815
01:28:33,685 --> 01:28:35,880
I need a little air. You work
it out with her, will you?

1816
01:28:35,988 --> 01:28:38,047
Yeah, I could do
with a little ozone, too.

1817
01:28:47,266 --> 01:28:50,099
Those are the posters and these
are the ads for the broadcast.

1818
01:28:50,202 --> 01:28:51,499
They'll be in 30 newspapers.

1819
01:28:51,570 --> 01:28:53,970
It'll be the biggest send off
any candidate ever had.

1820
01:28:54,039 --> 01:28:56,667
Radio, television, newsreels,
the press, the works.

1821
01:28:56,742 --> 01:28:58,266
No use having dough
and not spending it.

1822
01:28:58,377 --> 01:29:00,902
Excellent idea, doing
it all from his own home.

1823
01:29:01,013 --> 01:29:02,674
A fireside chat
from the next president.

1824
01:29:02,748 --> 01:29:04,682
To say nothing of the next
president's wife and kids.

1825
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:06,274
No one'll top us for corn.

1826
01:29:06,351 --> 01:29:09,582
Where does this Thorndyke
dame fit in the picture?

1827
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:11,219
What do you mean by that?

1828
01:29:11,290 --> 01:29:14,123
Let's not start kidding each
other, there's a rumor around...

1829
01:29:14,226 --> 01:29:16,217
Ridiculous, an old wives' tale. What rumor?

1830
01:29:16,295 --> 01:29:18,422
Kay Thorndyke and Matthews.
I've heard it twice.

1831
01:29:18,530 --> 01:29:20,964
Bill, I'm surprised at you
spreading a foul story like that.

1832
01:29:21,066 --> 01:29:24,001
I'm spreading nothing. But I want
to be sure there's nothing to spread.

1833
01:29:24,069 --> 01:29:25,900
Now, look, everything's
got to be kosher.

1834
01:29:25,971 --> 01:29:27,302
I thought he was a family man.

1835
01:29:27,372 --> 01:29:29,670
There's nothing to it.
Believe me. Would I lie to you?

1836
01:29:29,741 --> 01:29:31,265
Yeah, would he lie to you?

1837
01:29:31,343 --> 01:29:33,140
Don't make me
answer that question.

1838
01:29:33,278 --> 01:29:35,576
I tell you, Kay Thorndyke
is a friend of the family.

1839
01:29:35,647 --> 01:29:37,581
She and Mrs. Matthews
are just like that.

1840
01:29:37,649 --> 01:29:40,117
Will she be at the broadcast?
Why,

1841
01:29:40,219 --> 01:29:42,847
of course, she will. Mrs.
Matthews has already invited her.

1842
01:29:42,921 --> 01:29:45,788
Well, I'll be glad to see her
there. I've never met Miss Thorndyke.

1843
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,586
Let's get back to this campaign.
I've got some work to do here.

1844
01:29:58,904 --> 01:30:01,566
Is Mrs. Matthews in?
Spike MacManus.

1845
01:30:02,074 --> 01:30:04,304
Oh, you're Spike.
Come on in.

1846
01:30:08,747 --> 01:30:11,477
Buck Swenson,
I'm the butler around here.

1847
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:13,274
Excuse my appearance.

1848
01:30:14,119 --> 01:30:16,019
This happens every Saturday.

1849
01:30:16,121 --> 01:30:18,521
The kids and their packages
for Europe.

1850
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:22,787
You're quite
a heavy contributor, I see.

1851
01:30:22,861 --> 01:30:24,453
Yeah. Sir, you'd better
hang on to this,

1852
01:30:24,530 --> 01:30:26,760
if you don't want some
Belgian farmer wearing it.

1853
01:30:26,832 --> 01:30:28,197
I'll call Mrs. Matthews.

1854
01:30:30,002 --> 01:30:32,300
I was just going upstairs
to get my swimming trunks on.

1855
01:30:32,371 --> 01:30:34,566
Let the kids
swipe my pants later on.

1856
01:30:36,108 --> 01:30:38,975
Hi. Hi, what's going on out there?

1857
01:30:39,378 --> 01:30:41,471
Operation Bread Basket,
they call it.

1858
01:30:41,547 --> 01:30:43,139
While you're busy
feeding the world,

1859
01:30:43,215 --> 01:30:44,705
would there be a loose
cup of coffee for me?

1860
01:30:44,783 --> 01:30:47,115
I've been up three nights
running working on that broadcast.

1861
01:30:47,185 --> 01:30:49,050
You look as if you could
stand something stronger.

1862
01:30:49,154 --> 01:30:50,712
Lady, you twisted my arm.

1863
01:30:50,822 --> 01:30:52,289
Say, who was that character
who let me in?

1864
01:30:52,357 --> 01:30:56,259
Buck? He's the world's worst
butler and the world's nicest guy.

1865
01:30:56,328 --> 01:30:58,489
He was Grant's
first grease monkey.

1866
01:30:58,564 --> 01:31:01,397
Grant used to try to fire him,
but he gave that up years ago.

1867
01:31:01,533 --> 01:31:02,966
Speaking of characters,

1868
01:31:03,035 --> 01:31:04,662
how's Mr. Conover and company?

1869
01:31:04,736 --> 01:31:05,964
Oh, just straight, please.

1870
01:31:06,038 --> 01:31:08,734
Oh, he's busy making friends
and influencing delegates.

1871
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:10,501
And I might add,
delivering some.

1872
01:31:10,576 --> 01:31:14,034
I don't believe that. You can't
deliver the votes of a free people.

1873
01:31:14,146 --> 01:31:17,047
Mary, in Conover's eyes, the
lazy people, ignorant people,

1874
01:31:17,115 --> 01:31:19,083
and prejudiced people
are not free.

1875
01:31:19,151 --> 01:31:22,416
Spike, are all politicians
like Conover? No.

1876
01:31:22,521 --> 01:31:25,319
Thank heavens,
he almost makes me a Democrat.

1877
01:31:25,390 --> 01:31:28,416
That wouldn't help you any. The
Democrats have their Conovers, too.

1878
01:31:28,493 --> 01:31:29,858
In spades.

1879
01:31:30,395 --> 01:31:33,091
Here's to us wise guys
with all the answers.

1880
01:31:33,899 --> 01:31:36,026
All right, wise guy,
give me one answer.

1881
01:31:36,101 --> 01:31:38,035
What changed Grant in Detroit?

1882
01:31:38,103 --> 01:31:40,537
Detroit,
that's so many hotels...

1883
01:31:40,606 --> 01:31:44,167
Spike, please, what made Grant
change that speech at the last minute?

1884
01:31:44,242 --> 01:31:46,767
Oh, Mary, wouldn't you rather
hear how someday I'm going to buy

1885
01:31:46,845 --> 01:31:48,676
a country newspaper
and yell my head off?

1886
01:31:48,747 --> 01:31:52,114
95% of the newspapers are in
small towns. That's America, lady.

1887
01:31:52,184 --> 01:31:54,379
That's where the real
freedom of the press is. Yeah.

1888
01:31:54,453 --> 01:31:57,547
All right, Spike. What really
made you leave the tobacco smoke,

1889
01:31:57,623 --> 01:31:59,682
this fine sunny day?

1890
01:32:00,292 --> 01:32:02,123
Mary, a crisis hath arisen.

1891
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:04,125
A crisis, that's good.
What about?

1892
01:32:04,229 --> 01:32:06,026
The big broadcast.
Oh.

1893
01:32:06,131 --> 01:32:10,067
There's a story going around Republican
headquarters and Democratic headquarters

1894
01:32:10,135 --> 01:32:12,399
about you getting plastered
one night and throwing

1895
01:32:12,471 --> 01:32:13,904
Kay Thorndyke
out of your house.

1896
01:32:13,972 --> 01:32:15,030
Yeah.

1897
01:32:15,474 --> 01:32:19,410
If it isn't nipped in the bud, Grant's
political goose might be cooked.

1898
01:32:19,578 --> 01:32:22,274
Well, that's a true story. What
am I supposed to do about it?

1899
01:32:22,381 --> 01:32:24,349
It isn't true, and the
only way you can prove it

1900
01:32:24,416 --> 01:32:26,577
is to invite Kay here
to the broadcast.

1901
01:32:27,052 --> 01:32:28,485
Here to my house?

1902
01:32:28,553 --> 01:32:31,420
Be photographed with her. Make it
clear that she's a friend of the family.

1903
01:32:31,490 --> 01:32:33,754
Not just of Grant's.
Has Grant heard about this?

1904
01:32:33,825 --> 01:32:36,123
No, he doesn't know anything
about it. This is Conover's idea.

1905
01:32:36,194 --> 01:32:37,718
And sounds like him, if you...
Mom!

1906
01:32:37,796 --> 01:32:40,230
Yeah?
Mom, we need more bubblegum.

1907
01:32:40,298 --> 01:32:42,493
Bubblegum?
Goes in every package.

1908
01:32:42,601 --> 01:32:44,796
This is my daughter, Joyce.
Spike, Mr. MacManus.

1909
01:32:44,903 --> 01:32:47,770
Hi. Hi, you don't have
any bubblegum, do you?

1910
01:32:47,839 --> 01:32:48,931
Not on me, no.

1911
01:32:49,007 --> 01:32:51,168
Run and ask Buck.
I think he got some yesterday.

1912
01:32:51,243 --> 01:32:53,871
Buck!
Mom!

1913
01:32:53,945 --> 01:32:55,435
Mom!
Yeah.

1914
01:32:55,547 --> 01:32:57,037
We're stuck.

1915
01:32:57,115 --> 01:32:58,844
We haven't got any more
comic books.

1916
01:32:58,950 --> 01:33:02,078
Comic books? They go in every package, too.

1917
01:33:02,154 --> 01:33:04,418
This is Mr. MacManus, Grant.
Hi.

1918
01:33:04,489 --> 01:33:06,616
You haven't got any comic books, have you?

1919
01:33:06,692 --> 01:33:09,661
Of course, he hasn't. He is a
very distinguished newspaper man.

1920
01:33:09,728 --> 01:33:12,595
Oh, I don't know.
I have my hidden vices.

1921
01:33:12,864 --> 01:33:15,526
Oh boy,
I haven't read this one.

1922
01:33:15,634 --> 01:33:16,931
Okay, scram.

1923
01:33:17,602 --> 01:33:20,662
They're pretty swell kids.
Yeah, they're pretty swell kids.

1924
01:33:20,772 --> 01:33:22,296
You can tell Conover no.

1925
01:33:22,374 --> 01:33:25,969
This may be a stable to the dark
horse, but it's still home to me.

1926
01:33:26,044 --> 01:33:28,979
Besides, I think Kay would be
more comfortable in a kennel.

1927
01:33:29,047 --> 01:33:31,242
Then you won't let her come.
I certainly won't.

1928
01:33:31,316 --> 01:33:33,876
I agreed to let Conover have
this house for the broadcast.

1929
01:33:33,952 --> 01:33:36,113
I agreed to say
whatever he wanted me to say.

1930
01:33:36,188 --> 01:33:37,985
I even agreed to let him
use the kids.

1931
01:33:38,056 --> 01:33:41,753
Even though I don't believe that gang
of parasites could elect a rat catcher.

1932
01:33:41,827 --> 01:33:43,954
Even though I know
they're killing Grant.

1933
01:33:44,029 --> 01:33:46,463
Slicing him up sliver by
sliver until there's nothing.

1934
01:33:46,531 --> 01:33:49,830
And now they want me to invite that
woman to this house and pose with her?

1935
01:33:49,901 --> 01:33:52,131
Not me. They're not going
to slice me up, too.

1936
01:33:52,204 --> 01:33:56,197
Besides which, that particular day
happens to be my wedding anniversary.

1937
01:33:56,308 --> 01:33:57,332
Ouch.

1938
01:33:58,443 --> 01:34:00,468
You can tell Mr. Conover no.

1939
01:34:01,213 --> 01:34:03,841
Okay.
No is what I'll tell him.

1940
01:34:06,017 --> 01:34:07,917
And my apologies, lady.

1941
01:34:14,926 --> 01:34:17,554
I only do that to people
I like very much.

1942
01:34:26,705 --> 01:34:28,036
Spike!

1943
01:34:38,316 --> 01:34:39,749
Hello, boss. Come on in.

1944
01:34:39,818 --> 01:34:42,116
Where's Mary? She's
upstairs, dressing the kids.

1945
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:45,246
I've got my fingers crossed for
tonight. I can handle her. And Grant?

1946
01:34:45,323 --> 01:34:48,554
He's making an appearance over at
the local Matthews For President Club.

1947
01:34:48,627 --> 01:34:50,094
<i>The boys from Life
went along with him.</i>

1948
01:34:50,162 --> 01:34:52,756
Come on in, I want to show you something.

1949
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:56,563
Well, how do you like it?

1950
01:34:58,637 --> 01:35:00,662
Radio, 200 stations
coast to coast.

1951
01:35:00,772 --> 01:35:04,173
Televisions, two cameras, complete
coverage for the whole Eastern Seaboard.

1952
01:35:04,276 --> 01:35:07,507
The Four Blue Notes Quartet. They
came out with Grant's campaign song.

1953
01:35:07,612 --> 01:35:09,512
The club band
and the local yokels,

1954
01:35:09,581 --> 01:35:11,208
all the trimmings
including the press.

1955
01:35:11,283 --> 01:35:12,716
Wonderful. Really wonderful.

1956
01:35:12,784 --> 01:35:15,810
I could've gotten a bigger turnout for
someone who didn't want to be president.

1957
01:35:15,887 --> 01:35:19,015
Blink, what about the Matthews speech?
I think there's been some changes.

1958
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:21,615
Everybody in there has made
at least three changes already.

1959
01:35:21,693 --> 01:35:23,320
Hasn't this Matthews
any mind of his own?

1960
01:35:23,395 --> 01:35:25,420
Blink Moran, the Network
producer, Miss Thorndyke.

1961
01:35:25,497 --> 01:35:26,589
How do you do?
Is anything wrong?

1962
01:35:26,665 --> 01:35:28,132
Don't mind Blink,
he's got ulcers.

1963
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:31,397
You listen to politicians night
after night. You'll have ulcers, too.

1964
01:35:31,469 --> 01:35:32,902
Mr. Matthews
is no politician.

1965
01:35:32,971 --> 01:35:35,201
I've read this lady,
he is for my dough.

1966
01:35:35,273 --> 01:35:38,106
In the library, I think
we can be among friends.

1967
01:35:39,144 --> 01:35:41,476
Coca Cola.
Well, speak of the devil.

1968
01:35:41,713 --> 01:35:44,511
Am I glad to see you, I was
afraid you were going to be late.

1969
01:35:44,583 --> 01:35:46,483
Not tonight, Jim. I've
waited too long for this.

1970
01:35:46,551 --> 01:35:49,213
Bill Hardy's waiting to meet
you. Bill Hardy, Miss Thorndyke.

1971
01:35:49,287 --> 01:35:51,755
How do you do?
Nobody told me not to dress.

1972
01:35:51,823 --> 01:35:54,121
Why, Mr. Hardy, you and I
are going to stand out.

1973
01:35:54,292 --> 01:35:57,455
It was sheer wizardry, the angle
you used on those Boston Irish.

1974
01:35:57,529 --> 01:35:58,518
Thanks.

1975
01:35:58,597 --> 01:36:00,064
Martini for her. Very dry.

1976
01:36:00,131 --> 01:36:01,792
Does Mary know she's here?
She invited her.

1977
01:36:01,867 --> 01:36:03,528
Have you ever been in a hurricane? No.

1978
01:36:03,602 --> 01:36:05,035
You will be.

1979
01:36:06,004 --> 01:36:07,494
Double whammy on her.

1980
01:36:07,572 --> 01:36:09,096
And, Mr. Hardy,
with you on our team,

1981
01:36:09,174 --> 01:36:11,438
nobody can accuse us of
being Wall Street, can they?

1982
01:36:11,509 --> 01:36:12,533
No.

1983
01:36:12,644 --> 01:36:14,805
The Judge and Mrs. Alexandar
are coming here tonight.

1984
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,108
Do you know
how to mix a Sazerac?

1985
01:36:16,181 --> 01:36:17,239
Sazerac?

1986
01:36:17,315 --> 01:36:19,180
Yeah,
it's a absinthe and...

1987
01:36:19,251 --> 01:36:21,651
It's a form of suicide
but don't sample one

1988
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:23,278
because it will light up
your vest buttons.

1989
01:36:23,355 --> 01:36:25,380
That's all she drinks,
and drinks.

1990
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:27,685
The Judge
takes straight bourbon.

1991
01:36:27,926 --> 01:36:30,121
Spike, don't think I'm
forgetting your contribution

1992
01:36:30,328 --> 01:36:31,852
to this great moment.

1993
01:36:36,001 --> 01:36:38,765
Secretary of the Treasury,
that's all I ask.

1994
01:36:38,904 --> 01:36:41,372
Nobody's gonna get sore
about this Matthew's speech.

1995
01:36:41,439 --> 01:36:42,963
He's for everything
except sin.

1996
01:36:43,041 --> 01:36:44,599
He must be bowlegged
from straddling.

1997
01:36:44,676 --> 01:36:47,839
Couple of months ago, he made some
good speeches. What happened to him?

1998
01:36:47,913 --> 01:36:49,881
Spike!
Here he is now.

1999
01:36:49,948 --> 01:36:50,937
Spike.

2000
01:36:51,216 --> 01:36:52,240
Spike.

2001
01:36:52,851 --> 01:36:54,978
Later, boys. We'll get
that later. Hello, boss.

2002
01:36:55,053 --> 01:36:57,578
Everything all right? Fine,
biggest news since V.J. Day.

2003
01:36:57,689 --> 01:36:59,213
Did you get the speech timed?

2004
01:36:59,291 --> 01:37:01,088
Time's all right.
What kind of a crack is that?

2005
01:37:01,159 --> 01:37:02,990
That's a joke. Come on.

2006
01:37:03,295 --> 01:37:04,762
What happened? Got that
before-the-big-game...

2007
01:37:04,863 --> 01:37:07,388
No, I'm all right. Just want
to be sure there's no slip-ups.

2008
01:37:07,465 --> 01:37:09,899
How's the audience? They were
cold. I couldn't warm them up.

2009
01:37:09,968 --> 01:37:11,629
You know a man's
never a hero...

2010
01:37:11,736 --> 01:37:13,795
Yeah, in his own home town.
Is everybody here?

2011
01:37:13,905 --> 01:37:15,896
Yeah, in the library.
Sam Parrish is on his way.

2012
01:37:15,974 --> 01:37:18,101
The Judge and Lulubelle
are due any minute.

2013
01:37:18,176 --> 01:37:19,734
They like to be sure
the bar's open.

2014
01:37:19,811 --> 01:37:21,301
Yeah, I'll be right down.

2015
01:37:21,413 --> 01:37:23,540
Hi, Dad. Want to hear
our radio speech?

2016
01:37:23,615 --> 01:37:26,243
Mom just helped.
What's the idea of this getup?

2017
01:37:26,318 --> 01:37:28,718
Our band. It's on the show.
Whose idea was that?

2018
01:37:28,787 --> 01:37:31,620
Yours, Grant.
Oh. Oh, Hello, Mary.

2019
01:37:31,823 --> 01:37:35,384
Keep out from underfoot, don't
be getting in people's hair.

2020
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:39,260
Mary, I want you to know I realize this
is not going to be too easy for you.

2021
01:37:39,331 --> 01:37:41,322
And you're nice to do it
for me, and I appreciate it.

2022
01:37:41,399 --> 01:37:43,765
Nonsense, Grant, I hope it's
everything you want it to be.

2023
01:37:43,835 --> 01:37:46,599
Oh, I almost forgot.
These are for tonight.

2024
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:54,339
I didn't think
he even remembered.

2025
01:37:54,412 --> 01:37:57,745
Remembered the what?
Oh, the anniversary.

2026
01:38:01,619 --> 01:38:03,143
My error.

2027
01:38:04,255 --> 01:38:06,689
Larranagas. It's the only kind
Jim Conover smokes.

2028
01:38:06,791 --> 01:38:07,849
Is she here?
Yeah.

2029
01:38:07,959 --> 01:38:09,449
Where is she?
In the library.

2030
01:38:09,527 --> 01:38:11,188
Well, here we go.

2031
01:38:11,296 --> 01:38:12,490
You know something, Spike?
What?

2032
01:38:12,597 --> 01:38:15,828
To quote your friend Conover, I'd give
my right arm up to here for a drink.

2033
01:38:15,934 --> 01:38:17,299
Oh, no, Mary, please.
Not tonight.

2034
01:38:17,369 --> 01:38:19,997
If there's one thing we don't
want, it's too much frankness.

2035
01:38:20,105 --> 01:38:21,538
All right, Spike.
I'll be good.

2036
01:38:21,639 --> 01:38:23,664
Hey, Mom, you look swell.

2037
01:38:24,642 --> 01:38:26,007
Thank you.

2038
01:38:27,512 --> 01:38:28,945
Oh, my carpet.

2039
01:38:30,315 --> 01:38:32,408
Now, I'd like
to propose a toast.

2040
01:38:32,484 --> 01:38:36,420
To the lovely lady who picked Grant
out of the pile in the first place.

2041
01:38:36,488 --> 01:38:38,012
Thank you, Jim.

2042
01:38:43,695 --> 01:38:46,323
Hello, Mary.
It was nice of you to ask me.

2043
01:38:46,431 --> 01:38:49,594
Hello, Kay. You're just in
time for a cocktail. Thank you.

2044
01:38:49,667 --> 01:38:51,157
You're looking
very pretty tonight.

2045
01:38:51,269 --> 01:38:53,965
Mary is going to be the best-looking
first lady we've ever had.

2046
01:38:54,039 --> 01:38:55,973
Let's get a nice picture
there. Shall we?

2047
01:38:56,374 --> 01:38:57,966
I'm sorry I wasn't here
to welcome you.

2048
01:38:58,043 --> 01:39:00,637
Face this way. This is the
first broadcast my children...

2049
01:39:00,712 --> 01:39:02,373
Big smile, that's right.
Shoot it.

2050
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:03,538
That's good.

2051
01:39:03,648 --> 01:39:05,980
...broadcast my children have
ever been on. They're very excited.

2052
01:39:06,051 --> 01:39:07,177
Mary, Bill Hardy.

2053
01:39:07,285 --> 01:39:08,513
Mr. Hardy the labor man.

2054
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:10,645
How do you do?
Nobody told me not to dress.

2055
01:39:10,722 --> 01:39:13,816
I am glad you did dress. Men are
much too lazy today about dress.

2056
01:39:13,892 --> 01:39:15,655
Ed Lauterback.
The farm expert.

2057
01:39:15,727 --> 01:39:18,491
How do you do? Your husband
talks well but you're prettier.

2058
01:39:18,563 --> 01:39:20,531
Thank you very much
Mrs. Draper, Mrs. Matthews.

2059
01:39:20,632 --> 01:39:24,295
Mrs. Matthews, you should be seen
more in public with your children.

2060
01:39:24,369 --> 01:39:26,394
Foreigners like children.

2061
01:39:26,838 --> 01:39:28,362
Doesn't everybody?

2062
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:31,170
Grace, let's not get started
on politics right away.

2063
01:39:31,242 --> 01:39:33,142
You're in for
a very bad evening.

2064
01:39:33,211 --> 01:39:35,645
No, politics is new to me,
but I'm very interested.

2065
01:39:35,713 --> 01:39:38,807
You've got the "very" in the wrong
place, Mary. Interested but very new.

2066
01:39:38,883 --> 01:39:40,145
Jim means I haven't...

2067
01:39:40,218 --> 01:39:42,516
Thank you. He means I haven't
lost my amateur standing.

2068
01:39:42,587 --> 01:39:45,055
You're learning, I hope.
That's a dangerous hope.

2069
01:39:45,156 --> 01:39:47,056
You politicians have
stayed professionals

2070
01:39:47,158 --> 01:39:49,820
only because the voters
have remained amateurs.

2071
01:39:49,894 --> 01:39:51,156
Anybody home?

2072
01:39:51,229 --> 01:39:53,754
Hello, Judge. I am Spike
MacManus, remember me?

2073
01:39:53,865 --> 01:39:56,857
Indeed I do. It's a great
pleasure seeing you again, sir.

2074
01:39:56,935 --> 01:39:58,869
This is Mrs. Alexandar.
How do you do?

2075
01:39:58,937 --> 01:40:00,768
Mrs. Matthews,
Judge and Mrs. Alexandar.

2076
01:40:00,872 --> 01:40:02,669
An honor to be here,
Mrs. Matthews.

2077
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:06,403
It's my duty to sentence your husband
to four years in the White House.

2078
01:40:06,511 --> 01:40:10,572
And I think I can safely promise the
votes of at least five Southern states.

2079
01:40:10,682 --> 01:40:13,947
In the election? I said
"Southern states", ma'am.

2080
01:40:14,052 --> 01:40:16,919
In the Republican Party, we
count only in the convention,

2081
01:40:17,021 --> 01:40:19,512
which reminds me:
when I was a small boy...

2082
01:40:19,591 --> 01:40:20,956
Well, I'll see you later,
Judge.

2083
01:40:21,025 --> 01:40:23,459
It has been a pleasure
seeing you again.

2084
01:40:23,528 --> 01:40:24,927
Who is he?

2085
01:40:25,230 --> 01:40:27,562
He is a newspaper man,
a friend of my husband's.

2086
01:40:27,632 --> 01:40:29,429
Bourbon for you, sir?
You read my mind.

2087
01:40:29,534 --> 01:40:31,365
I bet he can't
read my mind.

2088
01:40:31,469 --> 01:40:33,198
Sazerac, I believe.

2089
01:40:33,271 --> 01:40:36,604
Lulubelle, your reputation
is getting too well-known.

2090
01:40:37,609 --> 01:40:39,907
You know how to make a Sazerac? I think so.

2091
01:40:39,978 --> 01:40:42,640
If he only thinks so, Jeff,
you better make that Sazerac.

2092
01:40:42,747 --> 01:40:44,237
Yes, indeed, sugar pie.

2093
01:40:44,315 --> 01:40:45,907
That's my job.

2094
01:40:45,984 --> 01:40:49,044
I'm especially glad you were able
to come tonight, Mrs. Alexandar.

2095
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:50,587
Won't everyone sit down?

2096
01:40:50,655 --> 01:40:53,681
I'm afraid we women
are going to be outnumbered.

2097
01:40:54,058 --> 01:40:56,458
When I go out with the
Judge's Republican friends,

2098
01:40:56,561 --> 01:40:58,290
I am always outnumbered.

2099
01:40:58,396 --> 01:41:00,728
I make it a point to
tell my hostess right off

2100
01:41:00,798 --> 01:41:03,392
that while Jeff's a
Republican, I am a Democrat.

2101
01:41:03,468 --> 01:41:05,561
But you can speak freely.

2102
01:41:05,637 --> 01:41:08,731
You Republicans can't say
anything about the Administration

2103
01:41:08,806 --> 01:41:11,741
mean enough for us Democrats down South.

2104
01:41:14,512 --> 01:41:16,844
Would you like
a little martini?

2105
01:41:21,786 --> 01:41:22,878
Mmm-mmm.

2106
01:41:22,954 --> 01:41:24,444
Just an idea.

2107
01:41:25,290 --> 01:41:26,882
Hello, Grant.
Where've you been?

2108
01:41:26,958 --> 01:41:28,789
Hello, everybody.
I am sorry, I am late.

2109
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:30,919
You been rehearsing
your speeches? Hello, Bill.

2110
01:41:30,995 --> 01:41:34,192
Nobody told me not to dress.
On you it looks good.

2111
01:41:34,299 --> 01:41:36,164
Well, Judge.
Grant?

2112
01:41:36,267 --> 01:41:37,859
You're not going
to drink that thing, are you?

2113
01:41:37,969 --> 01:41:39,994
You're in the program, you
know. Mary, you should know...

2114
01:41:40,104 --> 01:41:41,469
Grant, this is
Mrs. Alexandar.

2115
01:41:41,539 --> 01:41:43,166
Hello, Mrs. Alexandar.
Mr. Matthews.

2116
01:41:43,274 --> 01:41:44,764
Handsome, isn't he?

2117
01:41:44,842 --> 01:41:47,834
You're the first good reason I've
ever seen for voting Republican.

2118
01:41:47,946 --> 01:41:49,470
I told your wife
I was a Democrat.

2119
01:41:49,547 --> 01:41:51,174
I understand
they're a necessary evil.

2120
01:41:51,282 --> 01:41:54,445
Well, you know us Southerners,
we vote Democratic down home

2121
01:41:54,519 --> 01:41:57,682
but we've got an awfully good
Republican record in Congress.

2122
01:41:57,789 --> 01:41:58,881
One minute to go.

2123
01:41:58,990 --> 01:42:00,548
Is Sam Parrish here yet?
No.

2124
01:42:00,658 --> 01:42:03,024
Why isn't he? What's the
matter? Can't you do your job?

2125
01:42:03,127 --> 01:42:05,288
Something's got to be said
about the South tonight.

2126
01:42:05,363 --> 01:42:08,560
You take Richmond...
Do I have to take it again?

2127
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:10,560
Jeff?
Yes.

2128
01:42:10,668 --> 01:42:12,659
This is the best Sazerac
I've ever had.

2129
01:42:12,737 --> 01:42:16,400
Fix me another one, honey,
right away. All right.

2130
01:42:17,008 --> 01:42:19,135
Hello, Kay.
Ready to go?

2131
01:42:19,711 --> 01:42:22,805
Destination White House. Yeah,
well, we can hope, can't we?

2132
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:25,815
How many people listening
tonight? Between 15 and 20 million.

2133
01:42:25,883 --> 01:42:27,441
Is that all?
Well, it's enough.

2134
01:42:30,989 --> 01:42:33,514
Stand by, everybody.
Twenty seconds.

2135
01:42:37,895 --> 01:42:39,590
Tell them 20 seconds.

2136
01:42:40,231 --> 01:42:41,425
Twenty seconds.

2137
01:42:41,532 --> 01:42:45,024
All right, everybody. Now on
your toes. Nothing must go wrong.

2138
01:42:45,103 --> 01:42:47,196
Good luck, Grant.
Thank you.

2139
01:42:47,272 --> 01:42:48,830
Good luck, Grant.

2140
01:42:52,844 --> 01:42:54,778
Hold it. Five seconds.

2141
01:43:03,921 --> 01:43:06,651
Ladies and gentlemen,
we invite you to history.

2142
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:41,759
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this
is a paid political broadcast.</i>

2143
01:43:41,859 --> 01:43:44,919
<i>Paid for, not by any political
group or organization,</i>

2144
01:43:45,029 --> 01:43:47,122
<i>but by thousands
of public spirited citizens</i>

2145
01:43:47,231 --> 01:43:49,927
<i>who have taken this method
of insuring that their voice,</i>

2146
01:43:50,034 --> 01:43:52,093
<i>the voice of the people
shall be heard.</i>

2147
01:43:52,203 --> 01:43:55,263
Jeff, honey, if I've got to
listen to speeches,

2148
01:43:55,373 --> 01:43:57,933
you better fix me
another Sazerac right away.

2149
01:43:58,042 --> 01:43:59,566
Yes, honey.

2150
01:43:59,811 --> 01:44:01,574
...in factories, in schools.

2151
01:44:01,646 --> 01:44:04,638
Voicing his opinions of the
problems besetting our nation

2152
01:44:04,749 --> 01:44:07,741
and frankly outlining his
ideas of how they should be met.

2153
01:44:07,819 --> 01:44:09,946
No politician, this,
selling a bill of goods,

2154
01:44:10,054 --> 01:44:11,715
no candidate for any office,

2155
01:44:11,789 --> 01:44:16,749
instead a private citizen fulfilling
what he saw as the duty of a citizen.

2156
01:44:16,828 --> 01:44:20,992
The result: a stirring
demonstration of democracy in action.

2157
01:44:21,332 --> 01:44:24,392
All over the country
spontaneously, unsponsored,

2158
01:44:24,469 --> 01:44:27,961
hundreds of Matthews for President
Clubs sprang up overnight.

2159
01:44:28,072 --> 01:44:30,302
And tonight, in more than
400 American cities,

2160
01:44:30,408 --> 01:44:33,844
men and women are gathered together
in the American way in halls, tents,

2161
01:44:33,945 --> 01:44:35,572
town squares,
in their own homes...

2162
01:44:35,646 --> 01:44:37,079
Where's Grant Matthews?

2163
01:44:37,148 --> 01:44:38,775
Where's our next president?

2164
01:44:40,084 --> 01:44:41,176
Who are you?

2165
01:44:41,285 --> 01:44:43,310
They have contributed
their dimes and their dollars

2166
01:44:43,388 --> 01:44:45,049
to pay for this telecast.

2167
01:44:45,123 --> 01:44:47,990
This is their program. This
is, in truth, the voice...

2168
01:44:48,092 --> 01:44:50,686
Where's your speech?
Right here.

2169
01:44:50,795 --> 01:44:54,162
Relax, fella. All you gotta
worry about is a third term.

2170
01:44:54,265 --> 01:44:56,358
Where's Mary?
She's in the library.

2171
01:44:57,335 --> 01:44:59,030
Hello, everybody!
Sam.

2172
01:44:59,137 --> 01:45:00,331
Late as usual.

2173
01:45:00,438 --> 01:45:01,598
Mary.
Sam.

2174
01:45:04,275 --> 01:45:06,470
I could eat you
with a spoon.

2175
01:45:06,677 --> 01:45:09,703
Nobody told me not to dress.
Isn't that what you're after, Bill?

2176
01:45:09,814 --> 01:45:14,012
Put evening clothes on labor and
let the rest of us go without.

2177
01:45:14,118 --> 01:45:15,642
Gosh, no.
Don't give me anything.

2178
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:18,416
I have been celebrating
all afternoon.

2179
01:45:18,489 --> 01:45:22,289
Great gosh Almighty. Do we
have to listen to Ed Lauterback?

2180
01:45:23,561 --> 01:45:26,359
That's better.
Hello, Miss Thorndyke.

2181
01:45:26,464 --> 01:45:28,432
Where did you get to
that night in Detroit?

2182
01:45:28,499 --> 01:45:30,990
I looked all over
the banquet hall for you.

2183
01:45:31,068 --> 01:45:32,296
I didn't go to the banquet.

2184
01:45:32,370 --> 01:45:35,305
I thought that's why you were in
Detroit, to hear Grant's speech.

2185
01:45:35,373 --> 01:45:37,204
Were you in Detroit
when we were there, Kay?

2186
01:45:37,275 --> 01:45:40,403
You must've seen her, Mary. She
was on her way up to your suite.

2187
01:45:40,645 --> 01:45:41,976
I'd just left you, remember?

2188
01:45:42,046 --> 01:45:44,514
No, I didn't
see Kay in Detroit.

2189
01:45:44,882 --> 01:45:48,283
You must've dropped in to talk to
Grant about his speech on big business.

2190
01:45:48,352 --> 01:45:51,879
Well, what Grant said about big
business that night was all right.

2191
01:45:52,156 --> 01:45:55,148
Especially about high
tariff, eh, Bill? Yeah.

2192
01:45:56,093 --> 01:45:58,459
So you changed Grant
in Detroit?

2193
01:45:59,730 --> 01:46:01,994
Sam, did you get that
finance report I sent you?

2194
01:46:02,066 --> 01:46:03,363
Yes, and it's a rotten job.

2195
01:46:03,434 --> 01:46:05,868
You let me handle
money matters from now on.

2196
01:46:05,937 --> 01:46:08,701
Hello, Judge. You drinking
with both hands now?

2197
01:46:08,773 --> 01:46:11,139
Hello, Sam.
These are for Lulubelle.

2198
01:46:11,609 --> 01:46:13,167
Sam, you're on.
How am I doing?

2199
01:46:13,244 --> 01:46:16,941
I am so hungry for some good
Republican talk I brought you two.

2200
01:46:17,048 --> 01:46:19,016
Jeff,
you're an angel.

2201
01:46:19,283 --> 01:46:21,683
I'll take one of those, Judge.

2202
01:46:34,398 --> 01:46:36,457
Mary, what are you
doing with that?

2203
01:46:36,567 --> 01:46:40,333
If we're going to have a high tariff, I
might as well get a little high myself.

2204
01:46:40,404 --> 01:46:42,304
For Pete's sake,
those are liquid dynamite.

2205
01:46:42,373 --> 01:46:44,068
Too bad I didn't
have some in Detroit.

2206
01:46:44,141 --> 01:46:45,403
Jim,
there's something I want...

2207
01:46:45,476 --> 01:46:47,842
Jeff, darling, make me
another one right away.

2208
01:46:47,912 --> 01:46:50,472
Yes, honey. Would you make
another one for me, too?

2209
01:46:50,581 --> 01:46:52,208
Yes, sugar.
I mean, ma'am.

2210
01:46:53,518 --> 01:46:55,816
My, my. They're very strong,
aren't they?

2211
01:46:55,953 --> 01:46:56,977
Surely.

2212
01:46:57,054 --> 01:46:58,885
What's in them?
I don't know.

2213
01:47:00,625 --> 01:47:03,890
You've been drinking these for years
and you've no idea what's in them?

2214
01:47:03,961 --> 01:47:07,055
Never bothered to ask, but it makes
you feel good. That's all I know.

2215
01:47:08,599 --> 01:47:11,568
I do hope Mr. Matthews
is including those paragraphs

2216
01:47:11,736 --> 01:47:13,567
I gave him about the Italians.

2217
01:47:13,638 --> 01:47:15,503
Their vote is so important.

2218
01:47:15,606 --> 01:47:19,007
If you favor Italy, won't that
loose you the Abyssinian vote?

2219
01:47:19,110 --> 01:47:22,773
There are about 17 Abyssinians
in the United States.

2220
01:47:22,847 --> 01:47:24,678
And only three of them vote.

2221
01:47:24,782 --> 01:47:29,014
Good. Then we don't need to worry
about justice for the Abyssinians.

2222
01:47:29,921 --> 01:47:32,515
Abyssinia?
That's up north, isn't it?

2223
01:47:38,930 --> 01:47:40,830
Where did those come from?

2224
01:47:41,132 --> 01:47:43,657
Mary, remember you have to
go on the air.

2225
01:47:44,168 --> 01:47:48,628
If this weren't my house, I could tell
her some place she has to go to, too.

2226
01:47:52,176 --> 01:47:56,636
Of course, in this election, the
Polish vote will be the most important.

2227
01:47:56,714 --> 01:47:59,148
I thought the Poles
voted in Poland.

2228
01:47:59,216 --> 01:48:01,377
We are talking
about Polish-Americans.

2229
01:48:01,485 --> 01:48:03,180
Can you be both?

2230
01:48:05,022 --> 01:48:06,546
More power to you, honey.

2231
01:48:06,624 --> 01:48:07,750
Thank you. They are
full of it, aren't they?

2232
01:48:07,825 --> 01:48:08,917
Surely.

2233
01:48:08,993 --> 01:48:11,553
For Grant Matthews
has long known and loved

2234
01:48:11,662 --> 01:48:14,631
the clean, rich smell
of fresh turned Earth.

2235
01:48:15,032 --> 01:48:17,125
His hands have labored
in the soil.

2236
01:48:17,201 --> 01:48:19,567
And helped it bear rich fruit.

2237
01:48:19,670 --> 01:48:23,731
Grant Matthews, like another
great Republican, Abraham Lincoln,

2238
01:48:23,841 --> 01:48:26,207
is of the earth
and of the people.

2239
01:48:26,310 --> 01:48:28,301
He has not forgotten either.

2240
01:48:28,379 --> 01:48:32,907
He knows that a prosperous and
protective and productive agriculture...

2241
01:48:33,651 --> 01:48:35,243
All right, Mrs. Draper,
here's your big moment.

2242
01:48:35,319 --> 01:48:37,651
We're ready.

2243
01:48:37,722 --> 01:48:39,690
Anyway, for president.

2244
01:48:39,924 --> 01:48:41,983
Mary, have a heart.
You've to be ready.

2245
01:48:42,059 --> 01:48:43,356
You're gonna miss Grant
on the air.

2246
01:48:43,427 --> 01:48:47,591
I am different from Grant. I'd
rather be tight than be president.

2247
01:48:48,399 --> 01:48:51,425
You're on a spot. You have to be
ready to do some quick thinking.

2248
01:48:51,535 --> 01:48:53,730
Don't worry about me.
I'm a very thick quinker.

2249
01:48:53,838 --> 01:48:55,328
Oh, brother.

2250
01:48:57,274 --> 01:49:00,243
Honey, you got twisted
up on that one. I did?

2251
01:49:00,344 --> 01:49:02,005
Sure.
I didn't.

2252
01:49:02,079 --> 01:49:05,276
<i>What did I say?
You said "thick quinker".</i>

2253
01:49:06,283 --> 01:49:09,047
I think I presented the
farmers' case if I do say so.

2254
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:12,521
Indeed. Who can speak for the farmer
better than you, Mr. Lauterback.

2255
01:49:12,590 --> 01:49:14,285
Thank you, Mrs. Matthews.
Not at all.

2256
01:49:14,392 --> 01:49:17,520
Who else could make hay
in the Capitol lobby?

2257
01:49:24,201 --> 01:49:26,260
I thought it was funny, too.
Oh, my dear.

2258
01:49:26,370 --> 01:49:30,204
I haven't enjoyed myself so
much since Huey Long died.

2259
01:49:41,218 --> 01:49:43,209
What's the matter, honey?

2260
01:49:43,287 --> 01:49:46,654
Oh, Lulubelle, I don't know
what's the matter with me.

2261
01:49:47,625 --> 01:49:50,253
I don't want to do any more.

2262
01:49:56,067 --> 01:49:58,001
I just want him...

2263
01:49:58,469 --> 01:50:00,232
Kay,
you better get in this.

2264
01:50:00,304 --> 01:50:01,464
Bill's holding
a pistol at my head.

2265
01:50:01,539 --> 01:50:02,938
What do you mean?
He's welching.

2266
01:50:03,007 --> 01:50:04,133
I am not welching.

2267
01:50:04,208 --> 01:50:06,802
You want me to go on that
radio to support Matthews?

2268
01:50:06,877 --> 01:50:08,606
Certainly.
Then I name the labor members

2269
01:50:08,679 --> 01:50:09,941
of the National Labor Board.

2270
01:50:10,014 --> 01:50:11,174
Grant made no such deal.

2271
01:50:11,282 --> 01:50:13,512
Jim and I did. We did
not. You misunderstood me.

2272
01:50:13,617 --> 01:50:15,482
I said you could
veto the appointments.

2273
01:50:15,553 --> 01:50:18,784
You're next, Mr. Hardy. Not till
I get this settled, get Matthews.

2274
01:50:18,856 --> 01:50:20,153
Never mind Matthews.

2275
01:50:20,224 --> 01:50:23,216
You can't have that. Labor as a
whole must make those appointments.

2276
01:50:23,327 --> 01:50:26,854
If I support Matthews, I am labor
as a whole as far as he is concerned.

2277
01:50:26,931 --> 01:50:29,559
If Hardy gets what he wants,
then I name Agriculture.

2278
01:50:29,633 --> 01:50:30,964
Hold on,
I've got a stake here.

2279
01:50:31,035 --> 01:50:33,196
Butt out, Parrish. We don't
need kibbitzers. Kibbitzers?

2280
01:50:33,304 --> 01:50:36,034
I am raising the money
here, and money still talks.

2281
01:50:36,140 --> 01:50:37,334
Hardy, one minute to go.

2282
01:50:37,408 --> 01:50:39,672
You better get Matthews
in here. Hold it, Spike.

2283
01:50:39,744 --> 01:50:42,838
You wouldn't be here if you could've
made a better deal anywhere else

2284
01:50:42,913 --> 01:50:44,642
and you're staying
until the end of the ride.

2285
01:50:44,715 --> 01:50:46,410
When the time comes,
I'll take care of the details.

2286
01:50:46,484 --> 01:50:48,577
I want to hear that from
Matthews. He's the candidate.

2287
01:50:48,686 --> 01:50:51,883
As far as you're concerned, I'm
the candidate. You'll do as I say.

2288
01:50:51,989 --> 01:50:54,583
So help me, I'll break
you in my newspapers.

2289
01:50:54,692 --> 01:50:55,818
Twenty seconds.

2290
01:50:55,893 --> 01:50:57,690
Make up your mind.

2291
01:50:59,430 --> 01:51:00,863
All right.

2292
01:51:00,931 --> 01:51:02,421
I'll go. I'll go.

2293
01:51:03,501 --> 01:51:06,061
As for the rest of you,
you'll stick to your bargains.

2294
01:51:06,170 --> 01:51:09,196
Grant's not to be bothered. If
you've any problems, come to me.

2295
01:51:09,273 --> 01:51:11,503
I'll say one thing for you,
Kay.

2296
01:51:11,575 --> 01:51:14,009
You have the courage
of your convictions.

2297
01:51:14,078 --> 01:51:16,774
You've had a wonderful evening,
wise-cracking, clowning,

2298
01:51:16,881 --> 01:51:18,872
but now, you've got to get
a grip on yourself.

2299
01:51:18,949 --> 01:51:19,973
Get some black coffee.

2300
01:51:20,050 --> 01:51:23,213
In a few minutes, you have to
introduce your husband to the country.

2301
01:51:23,287 --> 01:51:24,447
Mom!

2302
01:51:24,555 --> 01:51:26,921
Come on in. The man said
we make our speeches next.

2303
01:51:27,024 --> 01:51:29,788
He said not to be nervous.
I'm not nervous, Mom. Are you?

2304
01:51:29,894 --> 01:51:31,191
Judge, your big moment.
Okay.

2305
01:51:31,262 --> 01:51:33,730
Relatives listening.
Grandpappy staying up to hear.

2306
01:51:33,798 --> 01:51:36,198
Put the children to bed.
They're not making any speech.

2307
01:51:36,267 --> 01:51:38,360
But Mommy? What are you talking about?

2308
01:51:38,435 --> 01:51:39,868
Wait a minute.

2309
01:51:39,937 --> 01:51:41,370
Great gosh Almighty, Mary.

2310
01:51:41,438 --> 01:51:42,598
They're not going on.

2311
01:51:42,706 --> 01:51:44,606
Mary, what's the matter?
What's happened here?

2312
01:51:44,708 --> 01:51:46,767
And I am not going on either.
What?

2313
01:51:46,844 --> 01:51:48,436
I am not tight, Kay.
Not anymore.

2314
01:51:48,512 --> 01:51:51,572
Not after watching you vultures
picking at Grant's dead body.

2315
01:51:51,649 --> 01:51:54,641
And if that wasn't enough to sober
me up, the sight of my children did.

2316
01:51:54,718 --> 01:51:56,117
Mary...
I am not going on. I can't.

2317
01:51:56,187 --> 01:51:58,178
To millions of people
I am suppose to say

2318
01:51:58,289 --> 01:52:00,883
I know my husband to be honest,
uncompromising, fearless.

2319
01:52:00,958 --> 01:52:03,290
I could've said that once
and meant it, but not anymore.

2320
01:52:03,527 --> 01:52:06,428
Not after he met up with you, Jim
Conover, and you, and you, and you,

2321
01:52:06,497 --> 01:52:07,987
and you, Kay Thorndyke.

2322
01:52:08,065 --> 01:52:09,930
You and your mad ambition.

2323
01:52:10,034 --> 01:52:12,525
Catering to his conceit,
dealing and double-dealing.

2324
01:52:12,603 --> 01:52:14,696
You were going to make
a big man of him, weren't you?

2325
01:52:14,772 --> 01:52:16,535
You couldn't see
that he was a big man.

2326
01:52:16,607 --> 01:52:17,631
You killed him.

2327
01:52:17,741 --> 01:52:19,936
That won't be Grant Matthews
those people hear tonight.

2328
01:52:20,044 --> 01:52:24,242
It'll be a shadow, a ghost, a stooge
mouthing words that aren't yours,

2329
01:52:24,315 --> 01:52:25,612
thoughts that aren't your own.

2330
01:52:25,716 --> 01:52:29,208
You've killed Grant Matthews, and
he's a party to his own murder.

2331
01:52:29,286 --> 01:52:30,719
Well, I won't be.

2332
01:52:30,788 --> 01:52:32,449
You wanted a cause,
you've got one.

2333
01:52:32,556 --> 01:52:35,286
A cause of lies, fear,
and corruption.

2334
01:52:41,732 --> 01:52:43,256
Hallelujah.

2335
01:52:43,567 --> 01:52:44,932
There goes the ball game.

2336
01:52:45,002 --> 01:52:47,800
She's gone crazy!

2337
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:49,430
She called us a lot of crooks.

2338
01:52:49,506 --> 01:52:51,440
What did you expect her
to say? It's the truth.

2339
01:52:51,508 --> 01:52:54,170
What do you mean... We don't
have to kid ourselves, do we?

2340
01:52:54,278 --> 01:52:57,213
She has the right to say what she
thinks. That's how I want her to be.

2341
01:52:57,314 --> 01:52:58,781
I'm going after
the nomination.

2342
01:52:58,849 --> 01:53:00,544
That's what we've all
been working for.

2343
01:53:00,618 --> 01:53:01,812
Where's Mary?
The kids are on next.

2344
01:53:01,886 --> 01:53:03,285
The kids aren't going on.
Neither is Mary.

2345
01:53:03,354 --> 01:53:05,618
Tell that quartet to sing
again. Come on, sit down here.

2346
01:53:05,689 --> 01:53:08,658
You're going on in Mary's
place. One of the kids is sick.

2347
01:53:08,726 --> 01:53:10,091
You're a friend of the family.
Emergency.

2348
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:12,822
You've stepped in
to read Mary's speech.

2349
01:53:12,897 --> 01:53:14,865
Change the word... here.

2350
01:53:17,935 --> 01:53:20,233
Don't let Kay take your place
now. Leave me alone, Spike.

2351
01:53:20,337 --> 01:53:23,067
You love Grant Matthews. That
big mug is your whole life.

2352
01:53:23,173 --> 01:53:24,435
You know you do.

2353
01:53:24,541 --> 01:53:27,101
If you don't get in there now,
you're going to lose him.

2354
01:53:27,211 --> 01:53:28,735
Spike? Spike?

2355
01:53:29,046 --> 01:53:31,606
Mary, take it from a guy
who knows his horseflesh.

2356
01:53:31,682 --> 01:53:34,651
Grant Matthews loves you.
Deep down, he loves you.

2357
01:53:34,718 --> 01:53:37,209
He's just run into
a blind spot, that's all.

2358
01:53:37,288 --> 01:53:39,051
Spike MacManus.

2359
01:53:39,156 --> 01:53:40,316
Kay's being stupid.

2360
01:53:40,391 --> 01:53:42,188
She's trying to put Grant
into the White House.

2361
01:53:42,293 --> 01:53:43,760
The one place
she can't follow him.

2362
01:53:43,928 --> 01:53:45,919
And you, you're trying
to keep him out of it.

2363
01:53:45,996 --> 01:53:48,897
Out where the hunting is open,
out where Kay can grab him.

2364
01:53:48,999 --> 01:53:50,364
Be smart, Mary.

2365
01:53:50,467 --> 01:53:53,334
If Grant is elected, you'll be the
first lady in more ways than one.

2366
01:53:53,404 --> 01:53:55,167
Are you going to throw that
out of the window?

2367
01:53:55,239 --> 01:53:57,002
It's too late, Spike.

2368
01:53:58,309 --> 01:53:59,742
Okay, Mary.

2369
01:54:00,044 --> 01:54:02,774
I had the idea you were still
in love with him.

2370
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:06,646
Looks like the old MacManus
crystal ball finally cracked.

2371
01:54:07,084 --> 01:54:08,108
All right, read it.

2372
01:54:08,185 --> 01:54:10,449
Like any mother, Mrs.
Matthews thinks a sick child

2373
01:54:10,521 --> 01:54:11,783
more important
than any broadcast.

2374
01:54:11,855 --> 01:54:13,254
She's remaining upstairs
with her daughter.

2375
01:54:13,324 --> 01:54:15,121
Her speech will be read
by a friend and neighbor.

2376
01:54:15,192 --> 01:54:16,955
This is what Mary Matthews
wanted to say.

2377
01:54:17,027 --> 01:54:19,860
Great, every woman in America
will be bawling.

2378
01:54:19,964 --> 01:54:22,432
Grant, you follow me.
Give it everything you've got.

2379
01:54:22,499 --> 01:54:23,989
Does anybody
listen to me?

2380
01:54:24,101 --> 01:54:26,695
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mrs. Grant Matthews.

2381
01:54:26,804 --> 01:54:28,499
"This is Mary Matthews.

2382
01:54:28,605 --> 01:54:31,631
"I am prejudiced in my
husband's favor naturally.

2383
01:54:31,709 --> 01:54:33,301
"Though I know
he has his faults.

2384
01:54:33,377 --> 01:54:35,971
"He likes the morning paper
all to himself at breakfast

2385
01:54:36,046 --> 01:54:38,105
"and a toothache
becomes a world crisis.

2386
01:54:38,182 --> 01:54:40,275
<i>"I guess he's much
like all husbands in that."</i>

2387
01:54:40,351 --> 01:54:41,511
She's marvelous, Grant.

2388
01:54:41,618 --> 01:54:44,052
"But all in all, he's
quite a man, Grant Matthews.

2389
01:54:44,154 --> 01:54:45,849
"A good father
and a good husband,

2390
01:54:45,956 --> 01:54:47,287
"but I see in him
more than that.

2391
01:54:47,358 --> 01:54:49,485
"I see a man who is honest,
uncompromising,

2392
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:52,654
<i>"fearless, a man of great
vision and enormous courage."</i>

2393
01:54:52,730 --> 01:54:53,958
Mary?
"Above all, my Grant...

2394
01:54:54,031 --> 01:54:55,623
Mary, stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

2395
01:54:55,699 --> 01:54:57,860
What happened to you?
What changed you?

2396
01:54:58,035 --> 01:55:00,230
I thought you were
going to stay honest.

2397
01:55:00,304 --> 01:55:02,101
we'll resume
from the Matthews' home...

2398
01:55:02,172 --> 01:55:04,140
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Grant Matthews.

2399
01:55:04,208 --> 01:55:07,473
I am sorry to interrupt but
I can't take any more of this.

2400
01:55:07,544 --> 01:55:10,069
Don't you shut me off. I am
paying for these broadcasts.

2401
01:55:10,180 --> 01:55:12,580
Don't cut him off. Give him a
chance. It'll cost me my job.

2402
01:55:12,683 --> 01:55:14,173
Ladies and gentlemen,

2403
01:55:14,251 --> 01:55:16,617
that speech you just heard
Mrs. Matthews make,

2404
01:55:16,687 --> 01:55:18,416
she doesn't believe
a word of it.

2405
01:55:18,489 --> 01:55:20,423
When she told you
I was a good husband,

2406
01:55:20,491 --> 01:55:22,652
a man of courage
and the rest of that tripe,

2407
01:55:22,726 --> 01:55:24,887
the words were choking
in her throat.

2408
01:55:24,995 --> 01:55:27,691
A few minutes ago, she told me
what she really thought of me.

2409
01:55:27,765 --> 01:55:29,096
She called me a coward

2410
01:55:29,199 --> 01:55:33,363
and said that I had sold out my ideals
to a gang of corrupt politicians,

2411
01:55:33,437 --> 01:55:34,665
and she was right.

2412
01:55:34,872 --> 01:55:37,033
Then she was telling
me the truth. Stop him.

2413
01:55:37,107 --> 01:55:40,304
I have as much right to run
for president as a gutter rat.

2414
01:55:40,377 --> 01:55:42,436
Cut him off! Cut him off!

2415
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:51,010
Let him talk!

2416
01:55:51,088 --> 01:55:54,114
That squealing you hear,
that's from the politicians.

2417
01:55:54,224 --> 01:55:57,716
Those fearless patriots you heard
supporting me on the air tonight.

2418
01:55:57,795 --> 01:55:59,023
Now, they are hurt.

2419
01:55:59,096 --> 01:56:01,690
They are hollering.
They are trying to shut me up.

2420
01:56:01,765 --> 01:56:02,891
And I don't blame them.

2421
01:56:02,966 --> 01:56:05,434
You can't call me corrupt
and get away with it.

2422
01:56:05,536 --> 01:56:07,128
Your dirty company union fake.

2423
01:56:07,237 --> 01:56:10,400
Give me that microphone!
There it is. Go on. Take it.

2424
01:56:10,474 --> 01:56:14,433
Tell them how you bragged you could deliver
those 700,000 union votes of your men

2425
01:56:14,545 --> 01:56:16,240
if I made you
the big shot of labor.

2426
01:56:16,313 --> 01:56:18,281
Go on, your men will be
interested to hear that.

2427
01:56:18,382 --> 01:56:21,613
Tell them I was sucker enough to
believe that you could deliver any votes.

2428
01:56:21,718 --> 01:56:23,618
Wait until I get through
with your plants.

2429
01:56:23,687 --> 01:56:25,314
You won't do a thing
to my plants.

2430
01:56:25,389 --> 01:56:27,152
Put him on the front page,
boys.

2431
01:56:31,762 --> 01:56:33,821
Are there any
of the rest of you characters

2432
01:56:33,931 --> 01:56:37,662
who'd like to use this microphone
to speak a little truth into it?

2433
01:56:39,436 --> 01:56:41,666
You any better than they are?

2434
01:56:44,775 --> 01:56:46,572
A man just
stepped up and asked me

2435
01:56:46,643 --> 01:56:47,837
if I was any better
than the rest of them.

2436
01:56:47,911 --> 01:56:51,403
No, I am not. As a matter of
fact, I am worse than they are.

2437
01:56:51,482 --> 01:56:54,110
They're after all they can
grab. They're one-way guys.

2438
01:56:54,218 --> 01:56:55,378
But not me.

2439
01:56:55,452 --> 01:56:58,421
I was going to play both ends
against the middle.

2440
01:56:58,489 --> 01:57:00,548
I sold out to them,
but get this straight,

2441
01:57:00,624 --> 01:57:02,854
I am no lamb
led to the slaughter.

2442
01:57:02,926 --> 01:57:04,393
I ran to it.

2443
01:57:05,095 --> 01:57:08,462
I had the right idea when I started
to talk to you people of America.

2444
01:57:08,565 --> 01:57:11,796
The idea that you voters, you farmers,
you businessmen, you working men,

2445
01:57:11,902 --> 01:57:14,166
you ordinary citizens
of whatever party

2446
01:57:14,271 --> 01:57:18,332
are not the selfish scum that venal
politicians make you out to be.

2447
01:57:18,442 --> 01:57:21,434
I thought I could speak my
piece straight out and forward.

2448
01:57:21,512 --> 01:57:25,073
I thought I could tell you that this
country of ours is young. It's not old.

2449
01:57:25,149 --> 01:57:26,912
That we've just begun to grow.

2450
01:57:26,984 --> 01:57:28,645
That all we need is courage.

2451
01:57:28,752 --> 01:57:32,916
And from out of that courage will come
a greatness greater than we ever dreamed.

2452
01:57:32,990 --> 01:57:36,517
I wanted to tell you that we
Americans are the hope of the world.

2453
01:57:36,627 --> 01:57:39,596
And the secret of our
great plenty is freedom.

2454
01:57:39,663 --> 01:57:42,131
And we've got to share
that secret and that plenty

2455
01:57:42,199 --> 01:57:44,599
with the other nations
of the world.

2456
01:57:44,668 --> 01:57:47,159
And I wanted to tell you
that we face a great problem.

2457
01:57:47,271 --> 01:57:50,365
Because when people are
cold and hungry and scared,

2458
01:57:50,474 --> 01:57:52,999
they gather together
in panicky herds,

2459
01:57:53,110 --> 01:57:55,840
ready to be led
by communists and fascists

2460
01:57:55,946 --> 01:57:58,005
who promise them
bread for freedom

2461
01:57:58,115 --> 01:57:59,980
and deliver neither.

2462
01:58:00,884 --> 01:58:03,444
Those are the things
I wanted to say you.

2463
01:58:03,987 --> 01:58:05,682
But I lost faith in you.

2464
01:58:05,789 --> 01:58:07,814
I lost faith in myself.

2465
01:58:08,292 --> 01:58:10,954
I was afraid
I wouldn't become president.

2466
01:58:11,395 --> 01:58:15,991
I forgot that the one thing you've got
to do is speak your piece no matter what.

2467
01:58:17,568 --> 01:58:21,004
So with the help
of this gang of parasites,

2468
01:58:21,071 --> 01:58:24,234
I convinced myself that the way
to be elected was to play down

2469
01:58:24,341 --> 01:58:28,471
to your lowest common denominator
instead of up to your highest.

2470
01:58:28,579 --> 01:58:32,140
To cater to the hatred
of every class and race.

2471
01:58:32,216 --> 01:58:35,208
To appeal to the worst in you,
not the best in you.

2472
01:58:37,087 --> 01:58:40,523
I used my wife,
my kids, my friends.

2473
01:58:41,391 --> 01:58:43,916
My whole campaign was a fraud.

2474
01:58:45,262 --> 01:58:48,254
This is no simple
fireside broadcast

2475
01:58:48,665 --> 01:58:50,997
paid for by your dollars
and dimes.

2476
01:58:51,568 --> 01:58:54,935
This is an elaborately staged
professional affair.

2477
01:58:56,406 --> 01:58:59,842
I have spent $200,000
in exploitation and publicity

2478
01:58:59,910 --> 01:59:02,344
on "Matthews for President"
campaigns.

2479
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:06,408
I thought I could hijack
the Republican nomination.

2480
01:59:06,717 --> 01:59:10,380
I became an Al Capone of
politics, but I forgot one thing.

2481
01:59:11,255 --> 01:59:13,086
I forgot how quickly
the Americans

2482
01:59:13,156 --> 01:59:15,852
smell out the double dealers
and the crooks.

2483
01:59:15,926 --> 01:59:17,553
My wife knew,

2484
01:59:18,028 --> 01:59:19,859
and I knew tonight.

2485
01:59:20,264 --> 01:59:23,358
When I attended a meeting
right here in Greatwood.

2486
01:59:23,433 --> 01:59:25,458
They were all
my friends there.

2487
01:59:25,569 --> 01:59:28,629
People who had known me
for years and liked me.

2488
01:59:28,739 --> 01:59:30,764
But they didn't
like me anymore.

2489
01:59:30,874 --> 01:59:32,273
They were on to me.

2490
01:59:32,376 --> 01:59:34,469
They knew I was a phony.

2491
01:59:37,281 --> 01:59:40,375
Well, I guess that's the
story, ladies and gentlemen.

2492
01:59:41,251 --> 01:59:44,220
And it certainly isn't
one I am proud of.

2493
01:59:45,956 --> 01:59:48,584
I am the guy who screamed

2494
01:59:49,726 --> 01:59:51,751
for a warrior's courage

2495
01:59:52,162 --> 01:59:55,654
to face the simple private
battles of everyday life.

2496
01:59:57,434 --> 02:00:00,267
I am the guy they meant
when they said,

2497
02:00:01,271 --> 02:00:03,432
<i>"Physician, heal thyself."</i>

2498
02:00:06,576 --> 02:00:09,909
And so, here and now
I withdraw

2499
02:00:09,980 --> 02:00:12,278
as a candidate for any office,

2500
02:00:12,349 --> 02:00:15,682
not because I am honest,
but because I am dishonest.

2501
02:00:18,522 --> 02:00:20,513
I want to apologize

2502
02:00:21,358 --> 02:00:23,758
to all the good,
sincere people

2503
02:00:26,263 --> 02:00:29,494
who put their faith in me.

2504
02:00:32,169 --> 02:00:33,500
And

2505
02:00:35,105 --> 02:00:36,629
I want to

2506
02:00:38,208 --> 02:00:40,267
apologize to my wife.

2507
02:00:44,214 --> 02:00:45,545
Grant.

2508
02:00:53,457 --> 02:00:55,550
This is where I came in.

2509
02:00:56,793 --> 02:00:58,658
About that job, Kay,

2510
02:00:58,729 --> 02:01:00,356
still win or lose?

2511
02:01:01,665 --> 02:01:03,496
Then I lose, Jim.

2512
02:01:03,900 --> 02:01:06,801
<i>I saw a man on the cover of
Newsweek that I think you and I...</i>

2513
02:01:06,870 --> 02:01:08,963
Mr. Matthews, Republican
headquarters called.

2514
02:01:09,039 --> 02:01:11,303
They want to know if this
means you're out of politics.

2515
02:01:11,375 --> 02:01:13,673
No, I am just
getting into politics.

2516
02:01:13,744 --> 02:01:16,178
I am going
to the Republican Convention

2517
02:01:16,246 --> 02:01:18,578
and I am going
to the Democratic Convention.

2518
02:01:18,682 --> 02:01:22,641
I am going to open doors, break
down windows, let in fresh air.

2519
02:01:22,719 --> 02:01:25,586
I am going after every
candidate who compromises

2520
02:01:25,689 --> 02:01:28,556
and I am going after every
lazy voter who doesn't vote.

2521
02:01:28,658 --> 02:01:31,149
Take that gosh darn microphone. Maizie!

2522
02:01:41,938 --> 02:01:43,565
Fired?
Fired.

2523
02:01:44,674 --> 02:01:46,198
Hired?
Hired.

2524
02:01:54,084 --> 02:01:56,484
<i>Matthews is our man!</i>

2525
02:01:57,305 --> 02:02:03,738
