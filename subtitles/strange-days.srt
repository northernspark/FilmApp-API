00:01:22,114 --> 00:01:24,582
-You ready?
-Yeah. Boot it.

3
00:01:28,114 --> 00:01:29,672
-That's it.
-Okay, that's it.

4
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:31,432
-I'm recording!
-Good, good.

5

Are you crazy?
Wait till l get this down!

6
00:01:34,154 --> 00:01:35,303
You trying to l.D. me?

7
00:01:35,514 --> 00:01:37,744
-Fucking retard!
-What's the problem?

8
00:01:37,954 --> 00:01:39,706
-Don't be a pussy.
-Fuck you.

9
00:01:39,954 --> 00:01:43,264
Fuck you, don't call me a pussy.
I'll fucking l.D. you!

10
00:01:43,474 --> 00:01:45,590
-Take the gun.
-I get this piece of shit?

11
00:01:45,794 --> 00:01:47,910
I can't believe it.
Is it even loaded?

12
00:01:48,114 --> 00:01:51,186
I want the auto.
I never get the auto!

13
00:01:53,274 --> 00:01:55,151
I fucked your shit, man!

14
00:01:55,354 --> 00:01:57,390
Don't fucking shoot at me!

15
00:01:58,434 --> 00:02:00,152
Don't fucking touch me.

16
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,548
Right there. Turn right.

17
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:04,143
Okay, okay, okay! Just relax.

18
00:02:05,954 --> 00:02:08,866
Here we go, here we go.
There it is, there it is.

19
00:02:09,114 --> 00:02:10,467
Easy, easy, easy.

20
00:02:10,674 --> 00:02:12,471
Okay, one, two, three.

21
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:16,383
-Go!
-Yeah, go!

22
00:02:17,274 --> 00:02:18,593
Crush that punk!

23
00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:22,866
Go, go, go, go!

24
00:02:23,114 --> 00:02:25,582
Get on the ground, you motherfucker!

25
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:34,828
Hands in the air! Hands in the air!

26
00:02:35,394 --> 00:02:37,305
No, no, no. Where you going, bitch?

27
00:02:37,514 --> 00:02:39,106
Over here! Over here!

28
00:02:39,314 --> 00:02:42,829
-Get the fucking money!
-You, open the register. Now!

29
00:02:43,074 --> 00:02:45,383
You want to fucking die,
you little fuck?

30
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:47,306
Get the fuck out of the way!

31
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:49,266
That's it? That's it?

32
00:02:49,474 --> 00:02:51,829
-Where's the fucking money?
-Here we go.

33
00:02:52,074 --> 00:02:55,225
-Don't shoot us!
-Come on. This way, this way.

34
00:02:55,874 --> 00:02:57,307
Go, man!

35
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,471
Run! Run, man, run!

36
00:02:59,674 --> 00:03:01,949
You want to die? Run, man!

37
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:04,714
Go! Don't look at me,
you fucking Chink!

38
00:03:04,954 --> 00:03:06,546
-Get in there!
-Get him inside.

39
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,187
Get inside! Get inside!

40
00:03:11,394 --> 00:03:13,430
-You get the money?
-Yes!

41
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:17,104
-What are you doing?
-Come on, man. We gotta go!

42
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:20,386
You get the money or not?
How much? How much?

43
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,343
-It's the police!
-Oh, fuck!

44
00:03:24,594 --> 00:03:25,788
I'm going! l'm going!

45
00:03:25,994 --> 00:03:28,349
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

46
00:03:28,794 --> 00:03:30,546
Come on! Follow me.

47
00:03:33,474 --> 00:03:34,702
Stop!

48
00:03:35,754 --> 00:03:38,109
The fucking doors are locked!

49
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:42,833
Where are the cops?

50
00:03:44,194 --> 00:03:47,106
What are you doing, man?
Just go, man, go!

51
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:49,751
Shit. Shit!

52
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,143
Drop your goddamn weapon!

53
00:04:01,954 --> 00:04:03,751
Come on. Come on.

54
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:06,027
Go, man, go!

55
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:16,306
Come on, jump! Don't look!

56
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:18,072
This is insane, man!

57
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:21,027
Hey! You stop, asshole!

58
00:04:23,474 --> 00:04:25,430
-Oh, no!
-Grab my hand!

59
00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:28,467
I'm gonna fucking die!
l'm gonna die!

60
00:04:33,554 --> 00:04:35,829
Goddamn it!
You know l don't deal in snuff.

61
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:38,548
-Don't have a coronary.
-You could've warned me.

62
00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:42,190
I hate the zap when they die.
It just brings down your whole day.

63
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:44,430
-Jesus, Tick.
-Sorry.

64
00:04:44,794 --> 00:04:47,149
How did you get it?
Why isn't it in evidence?

65
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,584
With all the blood,
they didn't see the rig.

66
00:04:49,794 --> 00:04:51,989
-It was under a wig.
-How did you get it?

67
00:04:52,194 --> 00:04:53,946
I got ways, Lenny, l got ways.

68
00:04:54,154 --> 00:04:55,872
I got a deal with some paramedics.

69
00:04:56,114 --> 00:04:58,582
My guy pages me,
l pick it up at the morgue.

70
00:04:58,794 --> 00:05:01,627
This clip has got to be worth
at least a grand, right?

71
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,472
Tick, not to dash your hopes. . .

72
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:06,268
. . .but you know l don't deal
this kind of product.

73
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:10,228
I'll pay four since l have to cut off
the end and my customers want uncut.

74
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:12,265
Fuck, the last part is the best.

75
00:05:12,474 --> 00:05:15,750
You dry-dive six stories and blammo!
You jack into the Big Black.

76
00:05:15,994 --> 00:05:18,189
I don't deal black-jack clips!

77
00:05:18,394 --> 00:05:20,464
It's policy. I got ethics here.

78
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:22,153
Yeah? When did that start?

79
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:24,584
This is what people want to see.
You know it.

80
00:05:24,794 --> 00:05:26,147
Give it to somebody else.

81
00:05:26,354 --> 00:05:28,106
Lenny, l got expenses.

82
00:05:28,314 --> 00:05:31,147
I gotta fix my rig.
There's blood all over the heads.

83
00:05:31,354 --> 00:05:33,185
-Put it away.
-Give me six at least.

84
00:05:33,394 --> 00:05:35,749
This is a good clip, man.
It gets you pumping.

85
00:05:35,994 --> 00:05:37,871
Well, the first part's okay.

86
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:40,344
Better than the usual soaps
you bring me.

87
00:05:40,554 --> 00:05:42,863
That's cold.
I always bring you choice.

88
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:46,828
Sure, like this low-grade shit here.
A girl fighting with her boyfriend.

89
00:05:47,074 --> 00:05:49,713
It's a test pattern.
Nothing happens. I'm snoring.

90
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:52,514
You're always telling me
bring you street life.

91
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:56,263
Bring you real life. That one man's
mundane and desperate existence. . .

92
00:05:56,474 --> 00:05:58,988
-. . .is another man's Technicolor.
-I said that?

93
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:02,072
-It's a direct quote.
-I'll take it for five.

94
00:06:02,594 --> 00:06:04,550
You'll make out okay.
It's pure cream.

95
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:06,312
No cut to the wearer.

96
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:08,186
Yeah, that's for sure.

97
00:06:08,674 --> 00:06:10,153
-Okay.
-What else you got?

98
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:26,631
Calls are a little kooky tonight.

99
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:29,553
It's a little after 2 a.m.,
December 30th, 1999.

100
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:32,587
-Second to last day of the century.
-Hello, Jer?

101
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:35,513
I'll drop the money by tomorrow,
next day latest.

102
00:06:35,714 --> 00:06:38,547
It's a little crazed now.
Would l lie? Never to you.

103
00:06:38,754 --> 00:06:41,871
Never to you. You're not wrong.
You're not wrong.

104
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:43,863
Prick.

105
00:06:52,154 --> 00:06:53,906
Dan, you looking forward to 2000?

106
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,582
Not really.
I mean, what's the point?

107
00:06:56,794 --> 00:07:00,309
Nothing changes New Year's Day.
The economy sucks.

108
00:07:00,514 --> 00:07:02,470
Gas is over 3 bucks a gallon.

109
00:07:02,674 --> 00:07:05,746
Fifth-grade kids are shooting
each other at recess.

110
00:07:05,954 --> 00:07:08,787
The whole thing sucks.
What the hell are we celebrating?

111
00:07:24,314 --> 00:07:26,464
Shoot the clip.
Get it to me by Monday.

112
00:07:26,674 --> 00:07:29,268
Client wants a guy and two girls.
The guy wears.

113
00:07:29,474 --> 00:07:31,146
He's trying to be original.

114
00:07:31,354 --> 00:07:33,345
And the girls have to be young, okay?

115
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,829
So don't use your mother
like you usually do.

116
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:37,433
Yeah, you too, asshole.

117
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:39,033
Caller, you're on the air.

118
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:42,351
I'm DeWayne. I got a
New Year's resolution for the police.

119
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:44,829
Hey, yo, 5-0,
better get down with the 2K.

120
00:07:45,074 --> 00:07:46,553
2K, DeWayne? What is that?

121
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:48,585
2K, you know? The big 2000.

122
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:51,354
Tomorrow night.
Out with the old, in with the new.

123
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,749
See, for the Man,
no news is good news.

124
00:07:53,994 --> 00:07:57,589
He'd like to keep it the way it is,
but we're gonna make it our own.

125
00:07:57,794 --> 00:08:01,184
History gonna start right here,
you know? Right now.

126
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:03,828
I want to give a shout out to Boo.

127
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:04,989
You're on, Lori.

128
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:08,584
Read the Bible, Mark.
There won 't be another 1000 years.

129
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:10,671
We're in the Last Days as told in--

130
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:14,583
The Last Days? You mean the coming
of the Apocalypse, the Rapture?

131
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,103
Look at the signs.
Wars, and rumors of wars--

132
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:20,226
Just so the rest of us know
how much time is left...

133
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:23,073
... when is the Rapture
supposed to hit, exactly?

134
00:08:23,274 --> 00:08:25,026
Is it midnight, New Year's Eve?

135
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:26,462
That's right.

136
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:30,110
Is that midnight L.A. time
or Eastern Standard Time, or what?

137
00:08:30,314 --> 00:08:34,068
-What time zone is God in anyway?
-I pray for you all.

138
00:08:47,754 --> 00:08:49,312
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

139
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:53,029
Okay, yeah, l can use this.
Listen, it's not bad. . .

140
00:08:53,234 --> 00:08:55,350
. . .but move your eyes slower
next time.

141
00:08:55,554 --> 00:08:58,705
Much slower, like you're making love
with your eyes. Okay?

142
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:10,228
Let me get this straight.

143
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:13,824
You're gonna pay me $200 to put on
a hairnet and bang some babe.

144
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:15,632
I gotta think about this.

145
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:17,506
Let's get you wired up.

146
00:09:17,714 --> 00:09:21,263
I hope the axle grease in your hair
doesn't harm the SQUID receptors.

147
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:23,066
What is all this "squid" shit?

148
00:09:25,034 --> 00:09:28,310
Superconducting Quantum
lnterference Device. SQUID.

149
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:32,422
The receptor rig on your head
sends a signal to the recorder.

150
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:35,273
We call it being "wired. "
But there's no wire.

151
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,307
Keep the recorder close.
Five, six feet away max.

152
00:09:38,514 --> 00:09:41,984
In your jacket pocket, by the bed,
or wherever you close escrow.

153
00:09:42,194 --> 00:09:43,104
-Got it?
-Yeah.

154
00:09:43,314 --> 00:09:46,704
You got a half-hour of tape,
so give a lead-in to the main event.

155
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:49,263
But l don't want to leave for popcorn.

156
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:51,312
-Don't worry.
-You got it?

157
00:09:51,514 --> 00:09:54,984
-No problem.
-You look great. You look beautiful.

158
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:51,432
10- 17, do you request back up?

159
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:53,431
That's a negative.

160
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:58,069
Suspect is a black male. 35 to 40.

161
00:10:59,194 --> 00:11:00,547
We're handling it.

162
00:11:30,114 --> 00:11:32,469
-Freeze!
-Freeze, you bitch!

163
00:11:39,194 --> 00:11:41,264
You fucking bitch!

164
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:00,023
Fuck!

165
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:01,309
Fuck.

166
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:15,343
Oh, shit.

167
00:12:17,514 --> 00:12:19,072
God!

168
00:12:36,274 --> 00:12:39,630
Hi, it's Lenny.
Just what do you have in mind?

169
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:43,073
Lenny.

170
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:46,309
Goddamn it, you gotta be there!

171
00:12:46,514 --> 00:12:49,153
You gotta help me.
Please pick up the phone.

172
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:52,792
Come on, pick up.

173
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:56,185
Come on, Lenny.
Fucking pick up the phone!

174
00:12:57,594 --> 00:12:59,824
Okay, l'll call you back.

175
00:14:16,634 --> 00:14:18,067
You okay?

176
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,350
You're doing good, honey.

177
00:14:29,754 --> 00:14:31,631
You look so good.

178
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:42,308
-Hey, come back.
-You all right?

179
00:14:42,634 --> 00:14:44,033
You need help?

180
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:46,994
Sweetie, you're doing good.

181
00:14:55,274 --> 00:14:57,265
I'm sorry.

182
00:14:58,874 --> 00:15:01,786
-Hold my hand.
-I'm sorry, baby. Are you okay?

183
00:15:46,074 --> 00:15:47,427
How do you feel?

184
00:15:47,634 --> 00:15:48,589
Lucky.

185
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:52,672
Dry me.

186
00:16:02,034 --> 00:16:04,468
You want to watch or you gonna do?

187
00:16:04,674 --> 00:16:06,312
Watch and see.

188
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,553
Oh, wow.

189
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:58,230
You look so beautiful.

190
00:16:58,874 --> 00:17:01,434
I love your eyes, Lenny.

191
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,784
I love the way they see.

192
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:02,913
New Year's Eve, 1999.

193
00:18:03,514 --> 00:18:07,507
It's called the party of the century,
but it may be the biggest party ever.

194
00:18:07,714 --> 00:18:11,468
No one's seen preparations like this.
But preparations require care...

195
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,743
...and insurance.

196
00:18:12,994 --> 00:18:16,703
And the LAPD is one insurance company
that doesn 't want accidents.

197
00:18:24,114 --> 00:18:26,992
The two bodies found today
under the Hollywood freeway...

198
00:18:27,194 --> 00:18:31,984
...have been l.D. 'd as rap star Jeriko
One and band member James Polton...

199
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,422
...known to fans as "Replay. "

200
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:34,862
Both were shot repeatedly...

201
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,912
...in what police characterized
as execution-style.

202
00:18:38,114 --> 00:18:40,423
An unidentified woman
was found with them...

203
00:18:40,634 --> 00:18:42,272
...also shot numerous times.

204
00:18:42,474 --> 00:18:45,671
Police said that the killings
appear to be gang-related.

205
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:49,389
With his band, Prophets of Light,
Jeriko One's political stance...

206
00:18:49,594 --> 00:18:52,791
...and violent lyrics have stirred
nationwide controversy.

207
00:19:26,154 --> 00:19:27,189
Keith.

208
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:29,344
Keith?

209
00:19:29,554 --> 00:19:31,146
-Yeah.
-Lenny.

210
00:19:31,354 --> 00:19:33,504
Lenny Nero.
We spoke on the phone. Hi.

211
00:19:40,234 --> 00:19:43,590
Not to be rude, Keith,
but l gotta ask. Are you a cop?

212
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:46,343
-I understand. No, l'm not.
-You understand?

213
00:19:46,554 --> 00:19:48,306
Attorney, right?
Attorney?

214
00:19:49,634 --> 00:19:50,749
-Right?
-That's right.

215
00:19:51,594 --> 00:19:54,267
Tasseled shoes.
Entertainment law would be my guess.

216
00:19:54,914 --> 00:19:57,826
Relax. It's my job to know people
and what they want. . .

217
00:19:58,034 --> 00:19:59,626
. . .what's behind their eyes.

218
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:03,304
Okay, so tell me.
Have you ever jacked in?

219
00:20:03,514 --> 00:20:04,833
Have you ever wire tripped?

220
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:07,583
No.

221
00:20:07,794 --> 00:20:11,070
A virgin brain! Good.
We're gonna start you off right.

222
00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:13,788
Just save us some time.
Tell me what you know.

223
00:20:14,274 --> 00:20:16,344
Just what l've read.

224
00:20:16,554 --> 00:20:19,910
The technology was developed for
the feds to replace the body wire.

225
00:20:20,154 --> 00:20:22,907
And now it's gone black market.

226
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:27,107
That's right. So this conversation
is not taking place, okay?

227
00:20:27,354 --> 00:20:29,549
-You're damn right it's not.
-Good. Good.

228
00:20:29,754 --> 00:20:33,713
-So do l get the deck from you?
-I'll get you a deck at my cost. . .

229
00:20:33,954 --> 00:20:36,343
-. . .since my thing is the software.
-Clips, right?

230
00:20:36,994 --> 00:20:38,347
Clips. Right.

231
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:43,427
Now, listen, l want you to know
what we're talking about here.

232
00:20:43,794 --> 00:20:46,592
This is not like TV, only better.

233
00:20:46,794 --> 00:20:49,024
This is life.

234
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:51,545
It's a piece of somebody's life.

235
00:20:52,394 --> 00:20:55,033
Pure and uncut,
straight from the cerebral cortex.

236
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:57,987
You're there.
You're doing it, you're seeing it. . .

237
00:20:58,194 --> 00:21:01,311
. . .you're hearing it,
you're feeling it.

238
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:05,114
What kind of things, exactly?

239
00:21:05,314 --> 00:21:08,112
Anything. Whatever you want.
Whoever you want to be.

240
00:21:08,314 --> 00:21:10,669
You can go skiing
without leaving your den.

241
00:21:10,874 --> 00:21:13,024
But l'm assuming a guy like you. . .

242
00:21:13,234 --> 00:21:15,190
. . .you want to ski, you fly to Aspen.

243
00:21:15,394 --> 00:21:18,113
That's not what
you're interested in here.

244
00:21:21,074 --> 00:21:23,907
It's the stuff you can't have.
The forbidden fruit.

245
00:21:25,594 --> 00:21:28,188
Like running into a store
with a .357 Magnum. . .

246
00:21:28,394 --> 00:21:32,182
. . .feeling the adrenalin pumping
through your veins. Or. . .

247
00:21:33,274 --> 00:21:36,630
. . .see that guy with the drop-dead
Filipino girlfriend?

248
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:39,268
Wouldn't you like to be him
for 20 minutes?

249
00:21:39,554 --> 00:21:40,782
The right 20 minutes.

250
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:42,713
I can make it happen.

251
00:21:42,914 --> 00:21:44,745
You won't even tarnish
your wedding ring.

252
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:52,383
-Sounds good.
-See, l can get you what you want.

253
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:56,269
I can. You just have to talk to me.
You have to trust me.

254
00:21:56,474 --> 00:21:58,430
Because l'm your priest.

255
00:21:58,634 --> 00:21:59,749
I'm your shrink.

256
00:21:59,954 --> 00:22:03,742
I am your main connection
to the switchboard of souls.

257
00:22:05,994 --> 00:22:07,427
I'm the Magic Man.

258
00:22:07,634 --> 00:22:10,273
The Santa Claus of the subconscious.

259
00:22:10,474 --> 00:22:13,193
You say it, you think it,
you can have it.

260
00:22:15,594 --> 00:22:16,743
You want a girl?

261
00:22:17,514 --> 00:22:18,469
You want two girls?

262
00:22:20,114 --> 00:22:23,424
I don't know what your thing is,
what you're curious about.

263
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,033
You want a guy?

264
00:22:26,074 --> 00:22:28,588
Maybe you want to be a girl.

265
00:22:28,794 --> 00:22:31,786
Think of that. Be a girl,
see what that feels like.

266
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:36,585
Maybe you want a nun to tie you up?
lt's all doable.

267
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:39,153
Talk to me about costs.

268
00:22:39,354 --> 00:22:42,585
Before we get into numbers,
l want you to try a taste.

269
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:45,183
-I got a deck with me.
-Right here?

270
00:22:45,394 --> 00:22:46,668
Step into my office.

271
00:23:21,714 --> 00:23:25,070
You were just an 1 8-year-old
girl taking a shower.

272
00:23:25,274 --> 00:23:28,425
Are you beginning to see
the possibilities here?

273
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:08,583
Hey.

274
00:24:08,794 --> 00:24:10,466
Where is he?

275
00:24:10,674 --> 00:24:12,426
In the back, making a deal.

276
00:24:13,634 --> 00:24:15,625
Can we meet someplace less public?

277
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:18,906
The cops have more to worry about
than the SQUID trade--

278
00:24:19,114 --> 00:24:20,069
Don't move!

279
00:24:20,274 --> 00:24:22,708
Assume the position,
you techno-perv puke.

280
00:24:22,914 --> 00:24:24,233
Beat it, fuckwad!

281
00:24:25,034 --> 00:24:27,468
-Gotcha.
-Jesus, Max, l was with a client!

282
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,029
You think that's funny? Prick.

283
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:32,829
You see the look on that
preppie puke's face?

284
00:24:33,074 --> 00:24:35,065
-Pissed on his Top-Siders!
-It was funny.

285
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:36,946
But it cost me a lot of money.

286
00:24:37,154 --> 00:24:39,065
Amigo, the world's full of marks.

287
00:24:39,274 --> 00:24:41,185
No one works them like you do, pal.

288
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:44,227
You could sell a rat's asshole
for a wedding ring.

289
00:24:44,434 --> 00:24:45,787
Yeah, l could.

290
00:24:47,114 --> 00:24:49,389
-Let me buy you a drink. Bobby!
-Bobby!

291
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:51,312
-Bobby!
-Bobby!

292
00:24:51,514 --> 00:24:53,266
Tequila. Double shots.

293
00:24:53,474 --> 00:24:55,385
Make it a Tres Generaciones.

294
00:24:55,714 --> 00:24:57,989
Nothing but the best
for my good friend.

295
00:24:58,194 --> 00:25:00,230
Finest cop to ever
get thrown off vice.

296
00:25:00,434 --> 00:25:01,628
Fuck you.

297
00:25:05,194 --> 00:25:07,833
-Nice tie.
-Thanks, Max.

298
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:11,987
-You always gotta dress like a pimp?
-The tie cost more than your wardrobe.

299
00:25:12,714 --> 00:25:15,786
-That's not saying much.
-It stands between me and the jungle.

300
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:16,949
To the jungle!

301
00:25:17,154 --> 00:25:21,511
Where some shitbird can cap you in the
back of the head and ruin your day.

302
00:25:21,714 --> 00:25:23,113
-You were lucky, Max.
-Yep.

303
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:27,148
So darn lucky, l wake up with
a .22 short floating in my brainpan. . .

304
00:25:27,354 --> 00:25:30,232
. . .and a cop pension
l can't live off of.

305
00:25:30,434 --> 00:25:32,629
It's a good thing
l wasn't any luckier.

306
00:25:35,074 --> 00:25:36,587
Bobby. Hit me again.

307
00:25:36,794 --> 00:25:38,022
You seen Faith lately?

308
00:25:38,234 --> 00:25:39,269
She won't call me.

309
00:25:39,474 --> 00:25:40,953
Just as well, Lenny.

310
00:25:41,154 --> 00:25:45,466
Faith was the most outstanding woman
a guy like you could ever hope to get.

311
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:47,983
And it's deeply humiliating
that she's gone.

312
00:25:48,194 --> 00:25:51,311
But you gotta face
that it's over, compadre.

313
00:25:51,514 --> 00:25:53,345
I'm touched by your concern.

314
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:56,273
I just hate to see
you pining away, okay?

315
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:58,942
You're my friend.
It makes me want to vomit.

316
00:26:01,594 --> 00:26:04,984
-Hey, lris. You okay?
-I gotta talk to you. It's serious.

317
00:26:05,194 --> 00:26:07,662
What happened, honey?
Some john get rough on you?

318
00:26:07,874 --> 00:26:10,149
No, l mean talk private. Please?

319
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:11,947
I'm in trouble.

320
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,189
So is Faith.

321
00:26:13,394 --> 00:26:16,750
-There it is, the magic fucking word.
-Can we go to your car?

322
00:26:16,954 --> 00:26:19,627
-There's something you have to see.
-What's going on?

323
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:24,386
-It's a bad situation.
-What?

324
00:26:24,594 --> 00:26:25,504
If they get me. . .

325
00:26:25,714 --> 00:26:27,386
-. . .I know they'll--
-Who?

326
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:29,946
Oh, shit!

327
00:26:35,034 --> 00:26:36,467
Hang on, that's my car!

328
00:26:36,674 --> 00:26:39,029
Not anymore. Belongs to the bank.

329
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:42,190
Hey, wait a second.

330
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:43,986
Oh, yeah, yeah. Great!

331
00:26:44,194 --> 00:26:47,948
Two million years of evolution,
that's the best idea you come up with.

332
00:26:48,154 --> 00:26:49,792
What do you get to repo a car?

333
00:26:50,034 --> 00:26:51,752
200? 250?

334
00:26:51,994 --> 00:26:53,905
I'll pay you 350 right now.

335
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:56,344
-You got cash?
-I was gonna write a check--

336
00:26:56,554 --> 00:26:59,022
-See you.
-Okay, l totally respect that call.

337
00:26:59,234 --> 00:27:02,192
I would want cash.
They'll take my check inside.

338
00:27:02,394 --> 00:27:04,954
You're pressed for time.
Just give me two minutes.

339
00:27:05,154 --> 00:27:08,351
Here, you can keep my watch
for collateral.

340
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:12,904
It's a Rolex.
Be right back. Two minutes.

341
00:27:13,314 --> 00:27:14,429
Two minutes.

342
00:27:18,834 --> 00:27:19,710
Son of a bitch!

343
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:34,230
What happened to your car this time?

344
00:27:34,434 --> 00:27:39,064
See, Lenny, if you packed your piece,
you could make the guy see sense.

345
00:27:40,314 --> 00:27:42,623
Bobby, turn it up.
I want to watch this shit.

346
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:26,309
You know how l feel?
Are you asking how l feel?

347
00:28:26,514 --> 00:28:28,982
We felt Jeriko! We listened to him!

348
00:28:29,194 --> 00:28:33,233
The LAPD is a military force...

349
00:28:33,434 --> 00:28:35,390
... turned against its own people.

350
00:28:37,274 --> 00:28:38,707
We live in a police state!

351
00:28:39,354 --> 00:28:40,753
-The mayor...
-Hey, Macey.

352
00:28:40,994 --> 00:28:44,145
...and councilmen sit in their offices
with their social programs...

353
00:28:44,354 --> 00:28:46,072
... that don 't work.

354
00:28:47,514 --> 00:28:50,984
They're rearranging deck chairs
on the Titanic.

355
00:28:51,634 --> 00:28:54,592
But a new day is coming!

356
00:28:55,474 --> 00:28:58,432
2K is coming!

357
00:28:58,634 --> 00:29:01,546
The day of reckoning is upon us.

358
00:29:01,754 --> 00:29:02,869
History...

359
00:29:03,554 --> 00:29:06,466
...ends and begins again...

360
00:29:06,674 --> 00:29:07,993
...right here!

361
00:29:08,354 --> 00:29:09,230
Right now!

362
00:29:09,434 --> 00:29:10,992
Right on!

363
00:29:11,194 --> 00:29:12,786
To the end of all things!

364
00:29:13,314 --> 00:29:15,066
You know how l know it's the end?

365
00:29:15,274 --> 00:29:16,229
No, tell me.

366
00:29:16,434 --> 00:29:19,187
Because everything's
already been done.

367
00:29:19,394 --> 00:29:23,512
Every kind of music's been tried,
every government's been tried. . .

368
00:29:23,754 --> 00:29:26,666
. . .every fucking hairstyle,
fucking bubble gum flavors. . .

369
00:29:27,114 --> 00:29:30,823
. . .breakfast cereal, every type of
fucking-- What are we gonna do?

370
00:29:31,074 --> 00:29:33,588
How we gonna make it
another 1 000 years?

371
00:29:33,794 --> 00:29:37,423
I'm telling you, man, it's over.
We used it all up.

372
00:29:37,754 --> 00:29:40,632
-What's this week's sad story?
-They jerked my wheels.

373
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:43,746
It's outrageous, the errors
the banks are making lately.

374
00:29:43,954 --> 00:29:45,512
-You noticed?
-No, l haven't. . .

375
00:29:45,714 --> 00:29:47,227
. . .because l make my payments.

376
00:29:47,914 --> 00:29:49,905
Max Peltier, how's the PI business?

377
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:52,344
Sucks. But as soon as l get
this new logo--

378
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:54,545
Shut up, l want to hear
this scumbag.

379
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:55,863
You have any leads?

380
00:29:56,074 --> 00:29:57,712
Why wasn 't security provided?

381
00:29:57,914 --> 00:30:00,109
We always had
adequate security available.

382
00:30:00,314 --> 00:30:02,953
He chose not to have
those encumbrances in his life.

383
00:30:03,674 --> 00:30:06,234
-Why's he a scumbag?
-You-know-who left Lenny for him.

384
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:09,114
-Faith left Lenny for him?
-Don't say "Faith. "

385
00:30:09,314 --> 00:30:12,386
Use the F-word around him,
it triggers a maudlin display.

386
00:30:12,594 --> 00:30:14,903
The LAPD said it's
a gang-related incident.

387
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:19,107
I only know l've lost a friend
and a man of great courage...

388
00:30:19,314 --> 00:30:21,874
... which is more than l can say
for most of us.

389
00:30:22,074 --> 00:30:24,190
-If you're riding, let's--
-Okay, let's go.

390
00:30:32,754 --> 00:30:34,665
"Driving Mr. Lenny. "

391
00:30:34,914 --> 00:30:37,667
It's gonna be a big night.
Can't you feel the energy?

392
00:30:37,914 --> 00:30:40,906
There's money to be made.
There's dreams to sell.

393
00:30:41,114 --> 00:30:42,229
Sleaze to peddle.

394
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:46,223
See, that is so unenlightened.
I sell experiences.

395
00:30:46,434 --> 00:30:48,994
I see it as performing
a humanitarian service.

396
00:30:49,194 --> 00:30:50,627
I probably save lives.

397
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:52,313
I want to hear this part.

398
00:30:52,514 --> 00:30:56,268
Everybody needs to walk to the
dark end sometimes. It's what we are.

399
00:30:56,474 --> 00:30:57,873
The risks are out of line.

400
00:30:58,074 --> 00:31:00,508
The streets are a war zone.
Sex can kill you.

401
00:31:01,034 --> 00:31:03,229
So slip on the 'trodes,
get what you need.

402
00:31:03,434 --> 00:31:06,471
Almost as good as the real thing.
A lot safer.

403
00:31:06,674 --> 00:31:09,552
Porno. Face it, you sell porno
to wireheads.

404
00:31:09,754 --> 00:31:11,551
Harsh! Harsh and untrue.

405
00:31:11,754 --> 00:31:15,110
My clients are professionals.
Some of them are even celebrities.

406
00:31:15,314 --> 00:31:18,192
-Yeah? What celebrities?
-The guy from the news.

407
00:31:18,714 --> 00:31:20,227
He does the weather.

408
00:31:20,434 --> 00:31:23,028
Well, that counts.
Hey, you passed La Cienega.

409
00:31:23,234 --> 00:31:26,590
-I'm not taking La Cienega.
-It's the quickest way to the club.

410
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:29,143
I gotta get to the club.
I got business there.

411
00:31:29,394 --> 00:31:30,827
You're my friend. I need you.

412
00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:33,508
Plus l'll give you 25%
of what l make tonight.

413
00:31:33,714 --> 00:31:35,511
This may be a hard concept for you. . .

414
00:31:35,714 --> 00:31:37,909
. . .but friends
don't have to pay friends.

415
00:31:38,234 --> 00:31:41,192
-Faith is singing there tonight.
-I should have known.

416
00:31:43,154 --> 00:31:46,464
Look, l pulled 1 2 hours.
I gotta get some sleep.

417
00:31:46,674 --> 00:31:49,188
I got one last pickup
at the St. James's Club.

418
00:31:49,394 --> 00:31:52,431
There's a taxi stand.
Catch a cab to where you want to go.

419
00:31:52,634 --> 00:31:54,067
A taxi?

420
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:55,906
Well, someone might see me.

421
00:32:01,154 --> 00:32:02,667
Damn it, you made me late.

422
00:32:02,874 --> 00:32:05,707
-What's his name? l'll find him.
-Fumitsu.

423
00:32:06,754 --> 00:32:09,029
Fumitsu. Fumitsu.

424
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,146
Oh, fuck.

425
00:32:17,434 --> 00:32:18,867
-Nero.
-Strickland.

426
00:32:19,074 --> 00:32:20,302
-Commissioner.
-Whatever.

427
00:32:20,514 --> 00:32:23,187
Since you canned me,
l don't even have to say "sir. "

428
00:32:23,394 --> 00:32:24,793
One of life's pleasures.

429
00:32:25,034 --> 00:32:27,343
You're peddling a little far
from your gutter.

430
00:32:27,554 --> 00:32:31,672
I was invited here by a close friend,
Mr. Fumitsu. He's right over there.

431
00:32:33,154 --> 00:32:35,031
I don't like disappointments, Nero.

432
00:32:35,234 --> 00:32:36,952
Do you know what disappoints me?

433
00:32:37,154 --> 00:32:39,304
Your sex life? Excuse me.

434
00:32:39,514 --> 00:32:40,993
Mr. Fumitsu.

435
00:32:44,554 --> 00:32:47,114
Leonard Nero,
BLS Limousine and Security Service.

436
00:32:47,314 --> 00:32:50,750
One of our finest drivers,
Lornette Mason, will take care of you.

437
00:32:50,994 --> 00:32:53,986
She's a security specialist
trained in defensive combat.

438
00:32:54,194 --> 00:32:57,152
Of course, the car is bulletproof
and fully armored.

439
00:32:59,434 --> 00:33:02,585
I'm coming along for a routine
periodic driver evaluation. . .

440
00:33:02,794 --> 00:33:03,988
. . .with your permission.

441
00:33:04,194 --> 00:33:08,187
We do it to ensure our VIP clients
are always treated as honored guests.

442
00:33:08,394 --> 00:33:10,032
Good evening, Mr. Fumitsu.

443
00:33:10,234 --> 00:33:12,031
Sir, please watch your head.

444
00:33:15,314 --> 00:33:19,227
Excuse me, Mr. Nero.
Excuse me, sir!

445
00:33:19,714 --> 00:33:22,228
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Coming with you.

446
00:33:27,954 --> 00:33:30,309
You will not live to see the morning.

447
00:33:33,074 --> 00:33:34,189
Drive on.

448
00:33:42,874 --> 00:33:44,785
-Are you a cop?
-No.

449
00:33:45,034 --> 00:33:46,103
No? Good.

450
00:33:46,554 --> 00:33:48,146
Have you ever been wired?

451
00:33:48,474 --> 00:33:49,429
Wired?

452
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:54,064
The latest technology.

453
00:33:54,274 --> 00:33:55,753
That is so beautiful.

454
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:58,269
You gotta take a look at this, okay?

455
00:34:00,954 --> 00:34:02,785
-You're gonna love it.
-You have more?

456
00:34:03,034 --> 00:34:04,228
-I have more.
-You do?

457
00:34:04,434 --> 00:34:08,029
-Believe me, l have more.
-Okay.

458
00:34:17,634 --> 00:34:20,592
Hey, hey! Careful on the jacket.
It's Armani.

459
00:34:20,794 --> 00:34:23,831
-Hey, you angry?
-I said, no wirehead shit in my car.

460
00:34:24,074 --> 00:34:26,349
-You're on foot.
-In L.A.? Are you crazy?

461
00:34:32,594 --> 00:34:33,549
Can l come in?

462
00:34:33,754 --> 00:34:36,791
I'm having a hard time
hearing the stereo.

463
00:34:37,994 --> 00:34:40,349
I need my case.
It's still in the back.

464
00:34:46,674 --> 00:34:50,462
Hey, can we talk a little bit here,
like two rational adults?

465
00:34:54,714 --> 00:34:56,113
That would be no.

466
00:34:57,434 --> 00:35:00,904
You got my attention. It's cutting
off the circulation to my head.

467
00:35:01,114 --> 00:35:02,308
Do you mind?

468
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,308
Mace.

469
00:35:13,474 --> 00:35:15,192
It's cool. Two seconds.

470
00:35:15,674 --> 00:35:19,223
This is uncharacteristic of you,
Miss lce-Water-ln-Her-Veins.

471
00:35:19,434 --> 00:35:21,152
You pushed me too far.

472
00:35:21,354 --> 00:35:24,073
I lost it in front of a client.
I could get fired.

473
00:35:24,274 --> 00:35:26,151
-Are we still friends?
-I don't know.

474
00:35:26,354 --> 00:35:29,585
Friendship is more than one person
doing favors for another.

475
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,466
-I know--
-I don't hustle friends.

476
00:35:31,674 --> 00:35:33,232
-Hey--
-You suck people along. . .

477
00:35:33,434 --> 00:35:35,994
. . .with your schemes, scams
and slick act.

478
00:35:36,194 --> 00:35:38,264
-Buddies?
-Don't use the time l'm talking. . .

479
00:35:38,474 --> 00:35:40,146
. . .to think about what to say next.

480
00:35:40,354 --> 00:35:43,073
-You listening?
-Yeah.

481
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,391
Your ass is always broke.
You go from one score to the next.

482
00:35:46,594 --> 00:35:47,993
You're getting strung out.

483
00:35:48,194 --> 00:35:49,263
You don't even see it.

484
00:35:49,474 --> 00:35:52,591
It's your brain, so you do whatever
the hell you want with it.

485
00:35:52,794 --> 00:35:54,830
But not on my watch.
You understand me?

486
00:35:55,074 --> 00:35:59,625
I got a child, l got rent,
and an ex-husband doing hard time.

487
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:03,668
He doesn't send me a dime of support.
I'm just trying to hold on here.

488
00:36:04,794 --> 00:36:07,866
I know you wouldn't be saying all this
if you didn't care.

489
00:36:08,114 --> 00:36:10,070
-Thanks.
-You get out with Fumitsu.

490
00:36:10,274 --> 00:36:11,992
And that's the end.

491
00:36:15,714 --> 00:36:18,865
I'll get you there in 1 0 minutes, sir.
I'm sorry.

492
00:36:19,074 --> 00:36:20,712
I'm changing my plans.

493
00:36:20,954 --> 00:36:24,742
Your supervisor has recommended an
excellent club, the Retinal Fetish.

494
00:36:24,994 --> 00:36:26,507
I believe it's on La Cienega.

495
00:36:26,714 --> 00:36:28,147
Yes, sir.

496
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:37,789
Enjoy your evening.

497
00:36:38,034 --> 00:36:41,106
Hey, Mace, l really appreciate it.
Thank you.

498
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:45,433
Excuse us.

499
00:36:51,514 --> 00:36:53,470
-Hi, Lenny.
-This is Mr. Fumitsu.

500
00:36:53,674 --> 00:36:55,630
Take care of him.
Show him a good time.

501
00:36:55,834 --> 00:36:58,394
John, can you take care
of this gentleman?

502
00:37:00,634 --> 00:37:02,704
Hey. Bye.

503
00:38:02,274 --> 00:38:03,229
How you doing?

504
00:38:03,434 --> 00:38:05,425
Who's the side of beef
in Gant's posse?

505
00:38:05,754 --> 00:38:07,073
Oh, that's Wade Beemer.

506
00:38:07,274 --> 00:38:09,913
He was a running back
for the Rams in '96 and '97.

507
00:38:10,114 --> 00:38:11,627
Hit like a freight train.

508
00:38:15,674 --> 00:38:18,427
-Rams, that's football, right?
-No, it's Ping-Pong.

509
00:38:18,634 --> 00:38:20,386
Hey, lris was looking for you.

510
00:38:27,114 --> 00:38:28,342
Hello, Lenny.

511
00:38:28,754 --> 00:38:32,463
It's okay, Wade, he's an old friend
of mine. Lenny Nero.

512
00:38:34,194 --> 00:38:36,424
Come to peddle clips
for old time's sake. . .

513
00:38:36,634 --> 00:38:38,750
. . .or making extra bucks
for the holidays?

514
00:38:38,994 --> 00:38:42,509
You're not a client. I wouldn't sell
you the sweat off a dog's balls.

515
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:45,673
I already got everything l need
from you, thanks.

516
00:38:46,714 --> 00:38:48,466
Cut it out, Philo.

517
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:52,873
Too bad about Jeriko. Tough break.
You've lost your golden goose.

518
00:38:53,074 --> 00:38:56,066
Try showing some respect.
He was an important artist.

519
00:38:56,274 --> 00:38:59,311
Important for your label,
which is why you're in mourning.

520
00:38:59,514 --> 00:39:02,984
His records will sell out
now he's dead. You'll make out.

521
00:39:03,354 --> 00:39:04,628
Always do.

522
00:39:04,834 --> 00:39:07,632
Faith, can l talk to you
for one second?

523
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:10,473
It's not a good idea right now, Lenny.

524
00:39:10,674 --> 00:39:12,551
I gotta talk to you for one second.

525
00:39:12,754 --> 00:39:16,190
-About what?
-That would be between me and Faith.

526
00:39:18,954 --> 00:39:21,514
Funny, l don't feel anything
between you and her.

527
00:39:21,954 --> 00:39:25,344
You see, that's your problem, Lenny.

528
00:39:25,554 --> 00:39:28,432
You assume there's something
where there's nothing.

529
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:30,943
You assume that you have a life.

530
00:39:31,154 --> 00:39:34,510
In fact, you're just peddling
pieces of other people's lives. . .

531
00:39:34,714 --> 00:39:37,547
. . .and the broken parts of your own.

532
00:39:38,074 --> 00:39:39,063
Faith.

533
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:42,425
-Wade, get him to his car.
-Call me. Faith, call me, okay?

534
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,548
Faith! Call me!

535
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:47,742
Lenny the Loser.

536
00:39:47,994 --> 00:39:51,748
-Leave him alone, Philo, okay?
-You shouldn't be talking to him.

537
00:39:51,994 --> 00:39:55,145
You shouldn't talk to anybody.
Not with all that's going on.

538
00:39:55,354 --> 00:39:58,744
You are too goddamned paranoid,
you know that?

539
00:39:59,154 --> 00:40:03,705
Paranoia's just reality
on a finer scale.

540
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:08,263
Thank you.

541
00:40:53,354 --> 00:40:55,345
-What up, Tex?
-What's up, my brother?

542
00:40:56,714 --> 00:40:58,750
Those rascals still
haven't grown back?

543
00:40:58,954 --> 00:41:00,785
No. Any day now.
I just know it.

544
00:41:01,394 --> 00:41:02,747
I got something for you.

545
00:41:02,954 --> 00:41:06,026
It's a present.
Something l had custom made.

546
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,147
Happy Millennium.

547
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,592
I got something for you too.
It just showed up tonight.

548
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:15,550
I don't know who from.

549
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:18,827
"Fan mail from some flounder?"

550
00:41:49,354 --> 00:41:51,390
-Hi.
-Hi.

551
00:44:34,314 --> 00:44:35,429
Hi, baby.

552
00:44:36,314 --> 00:44:37,588
I missed you.

553
00:44:38,394 --> 00:44:40,385
Lenny, you have to leave.
I mean it.

554
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:43,347
Iris said you're in trouble.
What did she mean?

555
00:44:43,554 --> 00:44:45,943
-You talked to lris? When?
-Tonight.

556
00:44:46,154 --> 00:44:49,305
I haven't seen her in months.
What the fuck would she know?

557
00:44:49,514 --> 00:44:52,984
-Who knows what's in her head?
-She used to be your best friend.

558
00:44:53,194 --> 00:44:54,547
What, lris?

559
00:44:54,754 --> 00:44:57,587
You're really running out
of excuses to come around.

560
00:44:57,794 --> 00:45:00,262
I know you, Faith.
You're afraid of something.

561
00:45:00,474 --> 00:45:02,510
-What's going on?
-Let it alone, Lenny.

562
00:45:02,714 --> 00:45:04,750
-It'll take care of itself.
-It's Gant.

563
00:45:05,154 --> 00:45:06,826
This guy is poison. Listen to me.

564
00:45:07,074 --> 00:45:09,668
He's got you walled in.
He uses the wire too much.

565
00:45:09,914 --> 00:45:11,984
He gets off on tape, not on you.

566
00:45:12,194 --> 00:45:14,754
That's a good one, coming from you.

567
00:45:15,194 --> 00:45:17,708
-Why don't you just split?
-I don't want to.

568
00:45:17,914 --> 00:45:19,188
What, you love him?

569
00:45:20,154 --> 00:45:22,714
I don't think so.
To him, you're just a possession.

570
00:45:22,954 --> 00:45:27,311
You're like a Ferrari,
just something to show the other guys.

571
00:45:28,234 --> 00:45:30,907
Yeah? He has his uses too, you know.

572
00:45:31,114 --> 00:45:32,103
What?

573
00:45:32,754 --> 00:45:35,473
-He gonna record you on his label?
-He might.

574
00:45:35,994 --> 00:45:37,746
You never know, right?

575
00:45:41,634 --> 00:45:45,422
Listen to me. I've watched you
create yourself out of nothing.

576
00:45:45,634 --> 00:45:49,104
You're like a goddamn cruise missile
targeted on making it.

577
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:50,713
And you will.

578
00:45:51,114 --> 00:45:52,627
I know l will.

579
00:45:53,594 --> 00:45:57,792
It's you up on that stage.
It's not him. You don't need him.

580
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:04,110
You have to get out.
If Philo catches you, he'll hurt you.

581
00:46:04,314 --> 00:46:06,191
-I'm already hurting.
-I'm serious.

582
00:46:06,394 --> 00:46:09,704
He's acting crazy.
He's doing way too much playback.

583
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:12,150
He's gotten completely paranoid.

584
00:46:12,354 --> 00:46:16,029
He's such a control freak, he's even
paying Max to follow me around.

585
00:46:16,234 --> 00:46:17,826
Max? You're kidding!

586
00:46:18,114 --> 00:46:19,547
Yeah, for about a month now.

587
00:46:20,954 --> 00:46:22,228
Jesus.

588
00:46:22,834 --> 00:46:25,871
Look, Lenny,
just stay away from Philo.

589
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,427
And stay away from me.

590
00:46:27,634 --> 00:46:28,987
Stop trying to rescue me.

591
00:46:29,194 --> 00:46:32,186
Those days are over.
I'm a big girl now. I've changed.

592
00:46:32,394 --> 00:46:36,433
Stop trying to save me. I don't
need saving. Just give up on me!

593
00:46:38,194 --> 00:46:41,106
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

594
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:47,229
You know one of the ways that movies
are still better than playback?

595
00:46:47,954 --> 00:46:51,185
Because the music comes up,
there's credits. . .

596
00:46:51,394 --> 00:46:53,624
. . .and you always know when it's over.

597
00:46:54,714 --> 00:46:55,783
It's over!

598
00:46:58,914 --> 00:47:00,142
You were great.

599
00:47:06,994 --> 00:47:09,554
Hey, man, l know what you're thinking.

600
00:47:10,034 --> 00:47:11,467
You should have told me.

601
00:47:11,674 --> 00:47:13,312
I was gonna. It's just a job.

602
00:47:13,514 --> 00:47:15,744
-I feel like shit about it.
-You should.

603
00:47:15,994 --> 00:47:18,986
I do feel like shit.
You introduced me to that prick Gant.

604
00:47:19,194 --> 00:47:21,628
I introduced him to Faith too.
Not a good move.

605
00:47:21,834 --> 00:47:25,463
Questionable move, definitely,
given the historical perspective.

606
00:47:25,674 --> 00:47:29,064
I take the prick's money--
You wouldn't believe what l charge--

607
00:47:29,274 --> 00:47:32,107
--and l make sure that Faith
is okay at the same time.

608
00:47:32,314 --> 00:47:34,464
I keep an eye on her for you, okay?

609
00:47:34,674 --> 00:47:39,384
Which you can't do without getting
your fingers bent the wrong way back.

610
00:47:40,234 --> 00:47:43,032
I need the money.
This way, it does us both some good.

611
00:47:43,234 --> 00:47:45,668
Fairly twisted logic, Max.
Even for you.

612
00:47:46,474 --> 00:47:48,590
-Hey, you got a job.
-I got a job.

613
00:47:48,914 --> 00:47:51,712
Okay, l'm sorry.
You got a job. That's great!

614
00:47:53,234 --> 00:47:55,190
Listen, you've gotta stay on her.

615
00:47:55,394 --> 00:47:57,385
-Watch her for me, please.
-I'm on her.

616
00:47:58,034 --> 00:48:00,309
-Okay.
-Be cool. Take care.

617
00:48:00,594 --> 00:48:02,073
-Take it easy.
-You too.

618
00:48:11,194 --> 00:48:12,912
Here, chicky, chicky, chicky. . . .

619
00:48:13,114 --> 00:48:14,627
Hey, wait a minute!

620
00:48:14,834 --> 00:48:17,826
I recognize you.
You're Wade Beemer, right?

621
00:48:18,074 --> 00:48:21,703
Running back for the Rams, '96, '97.
Am l right?

622
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:23,707
Yeah, that's right.

623
00:48:23,954 --> 00:48:26,422
I saw you play, man.
You were good. Really good.

624
00:48:26,634 --> 00:48:28,784
I mean, like a fucking freight train.

625
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:31,628
So, what happened? lnjuries or what?

626
00:48:32,314 --> 00:48:34,384
-Bullshit politics.
-It's always politics.

627
00:48:34,594 --> 00:48:37,586
Like this thing here.
He's paying you to tune me up.

628
00:48:37,794 --> 00:48:39,273
I could pay you more not to.

629
00:48:39,474 --> 00:48:42,830
-I could write you a check right now--
-I gotta go.

630
00:48:43,074 --> 00:48:46,271
Okay, cash! Cash!
Here's everything l have on me.

631
00:48:46,474 --> 00:48:49,546
Oh, look! What do you say?
How about a Rolex?

632
00:48:51,314 --> 00:48:52,827
I got a real one.

633
00:48:53,434 --> 00:48:54,787
It won't hurt too bad.

634
00:48:55,554 --> 00:48:59,183
-It's nothing personal, all right?
-Just one second, please.

635
00:49:01,354 --> 00:49:04,471
It's my jacket.
It's really expensive.

636
00:49:05,394 --> 00:49:07,032
Just not the eyes.

637
00:49:20,514 --> 00:49:21,469
You're bleeding.

638
00:49:21,794 --> 00:49:24,183
Some jerk puked on the stairs
and l slipped.

639
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,828
I should sue. You came back for me.

640
00:49:27,194 --> 00:49:29,708
I came back to pick up my client.

641
00:49:29,914 --> 00:49:31,267
No, you came back for me.

642
00:49:32,314 --> 00:49:34,953
I gotta lie down, Macey.
Please, in the back?

643
00:49:54,474 --> 00:49:56,942
You're some piece of work, Lenny Nero.

644
00:49:57,514 --> 00:50:00,312
You calmly backstroke along
in the big toilet bowl. . .

645
00:50:00,514 --> 00:50:03,028
. . .and somehow you never
let it touch you.

646
00:50:03,674 --> 00:50:07,110
Between working vice and your
current so-called occupation. . .

647
00:50:07,314 --> 00:50:10,067
. . .you must've seen
every kind of perversion.

648
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:13,346
But you're just like some Teflon Man.

649
00:50:13,554 --> 00:50:17,547
You still come out
this goofball romantic.

650
00:50:18,394 --> 00:50:20,954
It's my sword and my shield, Macey.

651
00:50:31,514 --> 00:50:34,347
All right, a little B&E action.

652
00:50:34,554 --> 00:50:36,272
-What did you say?
-Oh, nothing.

653
00:52:13,474 --> 00:52:14,623
Shit.

654
00:52:30,274 --> 00:52:32,310
Please. Please.

655
00:52:32,994 --> 00:52:36,066
Please, you can let me go.

656
00:52:36,274 --> 00:52:39,346
Please. I haven't seen your face.

657
00:52:41,034 --> 00:52:44,071
Let me go. Let me go, please!

658
00:52:44,274 --> 00:52:46,310
Oh, my. . . .

659
00:52:50,594 --> 00:52:51,663
Lenny.

660
00:52:52,434 --> 00:52:53,389
Lenny!

661
00:52:54,914 --> 00:52:59,192
Go to the Sunset Regent right now.
Go! Go!

662
00:53:18,474 --> 00:53:20,465
He's jacking it into his own output.

663
00:53:20,994 --> 00:53:22,507
She's seeing what he's seeing.

664
00:53:23,194 --> 00:53:25,708
She's seeing herself.

665
00:54:32,274 --> 00:54:34,834
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

666
00:55:19,394 --> 00:55:21,510
Lenny. What is it?

667
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:23,343
Black-jack.

668
00:55:23,634 --> 00:55:24,908
Black-jack?

669
00:55:25,354 --> 00:55:27,072
Snuff clip.

670
00:55:28,554 --> 00:55:29,953
It was lris.

671
00:55:30,314 --> 00:55:33,704
-Sick fucker killed her.
-Are you sure it's real?

672
00:56:09,114 --> 00:56:10,467
Oh, shit.

673
00:56:35,234 --> 00:56:37,065
Well, l've lost my appetite.

674
00:56:37,754 --> 00:56:39,426
For about a year.

675
00:56:43,594 --> 00:56:46,666
-Want to take a look?
-Hell, no. I don't fool with that.

676
00:56:50,034 --> 00:56:51,706
-You all right?
-Yeah.

677
00:56:52,234 --> 00:56:54,748
-You okay?
-No, not really.

678
00:56:57,714 --> 00:56:58,829
All right.

679
00:56:59,354 --> 00:57:00,503
Let's work it.

680
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,984
No, l can't.

681
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:06,022
Come on, Lenny.
You used to be good at this shit.

682
00:57:06,234 --> 00:57:09,067
-Play it down. What's the perp doing?
-I can't.

683
00:57:09,274 --> 00:57:12,346
You used to be a fucking cop.
That's a fucking murder.

684
00:57:14,394 --> 00:57:16,954
-What's he doing?
-Okay. He stalks her.

685
00:57:19,954 --> 00:57:22,343
He rapes her. And he does her.

686
00:57:22,554 --> 00:57:25,546
He records it. It's a thrill kill.
He wants to see it again.

687
00:57:25,754 --> 00:57:28,666
He records himself raping
and killing her.

688
00:57:28,874 --> 00:57:32,184
-And he sends the signal to her.
-So she feels what he feels. . .

689
00:57:32,394 --> 00:57:33,543
. . .while he's inside her.

690
00:57:33,754 --> 00:57:37,190
The thrill while he's killing her
is sent to her. . .

691
00:57:37,394 --> 00:57:40,511
. . .heightening her fear,
which heightens the turn-on for him.

692
00:57:43,994 --> 00:57:46,872
-I've seen a lot.
-So have l. Too much.

693
00:57:47,114 --> 00:57:48,911
It's a bad one. It's a bad one.

694
00:57:51,954 --> 00:57:55,310
He makes her see her own death,
feeds off the reaction.

695
00:57:55,634 --> 00:57:57,784
He records it all. Everything.

696
00:57:57,994 --> 00:57:59,313
And gives it to you.

697
00:57:59,514 --> 00:58:01,505
Yeah, he wants to share.

698
00:58:01,714 --> 00:58:04,706
Of course he wants to share, man.
That's his deal.

699
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:07,587
He needs an audience.
This is a sick puppy.

700
00:58:07,794 --> 00:58:10,592
-Why me?
-Because you're the Magic Man, Lenny.

701
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,872
You make dreams happen, don't you?

702
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:16,584
If it has to do with the wire,
eventually it washes up on your beach.

703
00:58:16,794 --> 00:58:20,673
I've never dealt in black-jacks.
Never. Everybody knows that.

704
00:58:20,954 --> 00:58:24,390
He's skull-fucking you.
He wants to get a reaction out of you.

705
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:27,751
He wants to make you do something
you do not want to do.

706
00:58:27,954 --> 00:58:31,742
Maybe he just figures Lenny
will appreciate what he's created.

707
00:58:31,954 --> 00:58:34,070
It's the dark end of the street.
You like it?

708
00:58:34,274 --> 00:58:35,707
Jesus, Mace. Back off.

709
00:58:35,914 --> 00:58:38,906
This guy is one of your
squid-head contacts.

710
00:58:39,154 --> 00:58:42,305
-He's somebody that you know.
-Problem with that is. . .

711
00:58:42,514 --> 00:58:44,664
. . .Lenny knows everybody.

712
00:58:44,874 --> 00:58:46,068
Take it to the cops.

713
00:58:46,274 --> 00:58:47,184
No.

714
00:58:49,914 --> 00:58:51,142
They'll crucify me.

715
00:58:51,354 --> 00:58:55,427
I see, so this wire-freak
gets to keep running around, huh?

716
00:58:55,634 --> 00:58:58,068
He's right.
They'll think he's the perp.

717
00:58:58,274 --> 00:59:00,993
Or they'll go through his
client list and ruin his life. . .

718
00:59:02,074 --> 00:59:03,143
. . .such as it is.

719
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:08,711
I'll call my buds in Homicide, say she
was a friend. They'll keep me posted.

720
00:59:08,914 --> 00:59:11,508
I'll get me the forensics
and all that shit, okay?

721
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,069
I'll call you when l get something.

722
00:59:14,274 --> 00:59:15,627
Relax.

723
00:59:19,314 --> 00:59:22,784
Keep moving, man. Somebody's thinking
about you a whole lot.

724
00:59:58,794 --> 01:00:00,307
Leave me alone.

725
01:00:01,914 --> 01:00:04,712
Don't come to my house.
Are you trying to ruin my life?

726
01:00:04,914 --> 01:00:07,348
Iris is dead. She was murdered.

727
01:00:11,754 --> 01:00:14,029
-Who did it?
-I don't know, but he's damaged.

728
01:00:14,234 --> 01:00:16,623
Iris said you were in danger.

729
01:00:16,834 --> 01:00:17,903
I'm not in danger.

730
01:00:18,154 --> 01:00:20,304
No more games.
Whatever you're hiding. . .

731
01:00:20,514 --> 01:00:22,630
. . .you have to get out of here now.

732
01:00:22,834 --> 01:00:23,983
Come with me now.

733
01:00:24,234 --> 01:00:26,111
Then what? Will you protect me?

734
01:00:26,314 --> 01:00:28,703
Big tough guy.
You're a fucking talker.

735
01:00:28,914 --> 01:00:30,347
You don't even own a gun.

736
01:00:30,554 --> 01:00:32,033
I do. It's under my bed.

737
01:00:38,554 --> 01:00:40,943
-You don't know what's happening.
-Tell me.

738
01:00:41,194 --> 01:00:42,388
Tell him, Faith.

739
01:00:42,714 --> 01:00:43,749
Go on.

740
01:00:45,314 --> 01:00:49,432
Listen, listen. Lenny just stopped
by to give me some bad news.

741
01:00:49,634 --> 01:00:52,751
An old friend of mine was murdered.
Remember lris?

742
01:00:52,954 --> 01:00:54,467
How did you get up here?

743
01:00:55,034 --> 01:00:55,989
Charm.

744
01:00:57,474 --> 01:00:58,793
Tell you what, Lenny. . .

745
01:00:58,994 --> 01:01:02,350
. . .just for you, make you a deal.
Why don't you just take her?

746
01:01:03,634 --> 01:01:06,228
If she's so unhappy and wants to,
she can go.

747
01:01:06,434 --> 01:01:10,188
I'll let her decide.
Faith always knows what she wants.

748
01:01:10,394 --> 01:01:11,986
Don't you, Faith?

749
01:01:12,634 --> 01:01:13,828
Hands off.

750
01:01:16,114 --> 01:01:17,149
Tell you something else.

751
01:01:17,994 --> 01:01:19,632
I'll tell you this, you fuck:

752
01:01:19,834 --> 01:01:23,144
If she says she stays, you go.

753
01:01:23,354 --> 01:01:28,189
You crawl back in your cockroach hole
and never cross my vision again.

754
01:01:36,674 --> 01:01:37,584
Come on.

755
01:01:52,234 --> 01:01:54,384
I've made my choice, Lenny.

756
01:02:00,394 --> 01:02:01,827
Get him out.

757
01:02:02,434 --> 01:02:03,833
Get him out.

758
01:02:04,834 --> 01:02:08,349
Fucking crazy, Faith!
You're fucking crazy!

759
01:02:14,114 --> 01:02:16,787
I don't love you anymore.
Do you understand that?

760
01:02:16,994 --> 01:02:21,784
You mean nothing to me.
Leave me alone, Lenny, please.

761
01:02:26,194 --> 01:02:28,947
You said you were gonna
get lris out of this.

762
01:02:29,194 --> 01:02:31,230
Now you understand
the danger we're in.

763
01:02:31,634 --> 01:02:35,627
So sweet what you said out there.
So touching, l almost believed it.

764
01:02:35,834 --> 01:02:39,031
I don't think he even understands
that you did it for him, right?

765
01:02:39,234 --> 01:02:42,192
He doesn't know what's going on.
Leave him alone!

766
01:02:42,394 --> 01:02:46,546
I'd love to, if he'd stop coming
around and you'd stop talking to him.

767
01:02:50,314 --> 01:02:55,024
The only time a whore should open
her mouth is when she's giving head.

768
01:03:03,714 --> 01:03:05,033
This is your floor.

769
01:03:05,274 --> 01:03:06,309
Just go.

770
01:03:06,754 --> 01:03:10,508
-Guess who's going to the hospital?
-Can we be smart here?

771
01:03:10,714 --> 01:03:12,909
I could make it worth your while.

772
01:03:14,354 --> 01:03:17,585
I'm not saying you don't land
a couple shots, just go light.

773
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,432
Here, look. Take my Rolex.

774
01:03:22,354 --> 01:03:23,582
Nice watch.

775
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:25,745
-Is this impact-resistant?
-Sure.

776
01:03:27,434 --> 01:03:29,106
You stupid piece of shit.

777
01:03:29,874 --> 01:03:31,432
You stupid fuck, get up!

778
01:03:31,954 --> 01:03:33,307
Come on, get up!

779
01:03:45,394 --> 01:03:48,227
We tried to find a smaller girl
to beat you. . .

780
01:03:48,634 --> 01:03:50,272
. . .but it was short notice.

781
01:03:50,874 --> 01:03:52,865
It was short notice.

782
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:55,632
That one had to hurt.

783
01:04:11,394 --> 01:04:12,793
Safety's on.

784
01:04:30,114 --> 01:04:32,469
Come on. Let's go.

785
01:04:33,594 --> 01:04:34,822
Hey, wait!

786
01:04:36,954 --> 01:04:38,706
That's fucked up.

787
01:04:42,714 --> 01:04:44,033
I need a drink.

788
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:47,863
-I want you to get some rest.
-Cops know they'll never nail him.

789
01:04:48,114 --> 01:04:51,470
The second they walk in the room,
what do they see?

790
01:04:51,674 --> 01:04:55,030
A dead hooker, handcuffs,
penetration. . . .

791
01:04:55,234 --> 01:04:58,670
Cops are lazy, and they know
nobody cares about a dead hooker.

792
01:04:58,874 --> 01:05:01,024
They're road kill. They'll come in. . .

793
01:05:01,234 --> 01:05:02,713
. . .take some pictures, make jokes. . .

794
01:05:02,914 --> 01:05:05,792
. . .shrug it off
like it's a random kill.

795
01:05:06,034 --> 01:05:07,865
The kind you never solve.

796
01:05:08,074 --> 01:05:10,668
-That doesn't add, does it?
-No, it doesn't.

797
01:05:10,914 --> 01:05:14,065
Iris knew somebody was after her.
That's not random.

798
01:05:14,314 --> 01:05:16,589
If they get me, l know. . . .

799
01:05:16,834 --> 01:05:19,064
She said "they. " "lf they get me. "

800
01:05:19,354 --> 01:05:23,313
Which means this whole random
sex-killer thing is bullshit.

801
01:05:23,514 --> 01:05:24,913
They whacked her for a reason.

802
01:05:25,314 --> 01:05:26,952
So the guy's not a psycho?

803
01:05:27,154 --> 01:05:31,864
He's a psycho. To do what's on that
tape, he's not a well-adjusted human.

804
01:05:32,634 --> 01:05:34,306
I gotta get some sleep.

805
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:39,464
Put that down.
I'll check on you tomorrow.

806
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:41,551
You want to rub my neck?

807
01:05:43,114 --> 01:05:45,105
Shoulder's real sore.

808
01:05:49,674 --> 01:05:50,948
-Right here?
-Yeah.

809
01:05:59,074 --> 01:06:00,189
Don't stop.

810
01:06:01,634 --> 01:06:03,226
How's Zander?

811
01:06:03,554 --> 01:06:04,907
He's fine.

812
01:06:07,114 --> 01:06:08,183
I miss him.

813
01:06:08,514 --> 01:06:09,742
He misses you too.

814
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:15,185
I'm real sorry about being so hard
on you earlier.

815
01:06:16,394 --> 01:06:20,785
It's just that l see you getting
sucked in deeper and deeper. . . .

816
01:06:21,034 --> 01:06:24,344
Mace, come on.
I know you still love me.

817
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:34,112
How do you do this in front of
a child? Get away!

818
01:06:34,714 --> 01:06:36,944
-In front of your own son!
-Hold up.

819
01:06:37,194 --> 01:06:39,469
In front of your own son!

820
01:06:48,154 --> 01:06:52,944
--a child loves you for a long time.
Not just to play with, loves you.

821
01:06:53,194 --> 01:06:54,104
Hi, Mommy.

822
01:06:55,354 --> 01:06:56,912
-This is Lenny.
-Hi.

823
01:07:18,884 --> 01:07:21,762
It's Lenny.
Just what did you have in mind?

824
01:07:24,404 --> 01:07:26,474
Last day of the world,
you spend it in bed?

825
01:07:29,684 --> 01:07:32,323
-What's up, Max?
-Not a whole hell of a lot.

826
01:07:32,764 --> 01:07:34,994
They've been saying words over Jeriko.

827
01:07:35,204 --> 01:07:37,240
Tensions running pretty high
down here.

828
01:07:37,444 --> 01:07:39,275
-Faith okay?
-Yeah.

829
01:07:39,564 --> 01:07:41,520
She's leaving with Gant.
I'll be fast.

830
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:45,956
Iris checked into the Sheraton last
night under a false name. Paid cash.

831
01:07:46,204 --> 01:07:48,274
Looks like she was hiding out.

832
01:07:49,844 --> 01:07:52,404
I heard you dropped in on Gant.
Slick Lenny move.

833
01:07:52,604 --> 01:07:54,640
He's in this somehow.
I don't know how.

834
01:07:54,844 --> 01:07:57,312
Just stay close to Faith, okay?

835
01:07:57,524 --> 01:07:59,355
No worries, bro. I gotta jam.

836
01:10:53,604 --> 01:10:54,673
What up, Lenny?

837
01:10:56,724 --> 01:10:58,396
-Where are we going?
-Anywhere.

838
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:01,643
You're acting strange.
What's going on? What?

839
01:11:03,124 --> 01:11:04,398
We'll talk in the car.

840
01:11:06,244 --> 01:11:07,802
Hand me that box of tapes.

841
01:11:20,324 --> 01:11:21,677
Oh, shit.

842
01:11:21,964 --> 01:11:24,273
-What?
-This tie doesn't go with blue.

843
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:36,395
Lenny, would you relax?
We're not being followed.

844
01:11:36,604 --> 01:11:38,993
-Stop being paranoid.
-The guy had a knife. . .

845
01:11:39,524 --> 01:11:40,559
. . .to my throat. . .

846
01:11:40,764 --> 01:11:41,719
. . .in my living room.

847
01:11:43,004 --> 01:11:45,313
Relaxing might be out, okay?

848
01:12:09,444 --> 01:12:11,799
That is one unbelievable
piece of eye-fuck.

849
01:12:12,004 --> 01:12:15,201
Skip the art criticism.
What can you tell me about the wearer?

850
01:12:16,884 --> 01:12:18,920
-The guy's fucked up.
-We know that.

851
01:12:19,164 --> 01:12:22,440
No. He's got some kind of distortion
in his visual cortex.

852
01:12:22,644 --> 01:12:25,556
The color and gray-scale values
are all messed up. . .

853
01:12:25,764 --> 01:12:27,595
. . .Iike color blindness.

854
01:12:27,804 --> 01:12:31,922
Could be some kind of tumor or brain
lesion or something, some trauma.

855
01:12:32,164 --> 01:12:35,759
-They're using a box to split signals--
-You ever make a box like that?

856
01:12:35,964 --> 01:12:38,603
A few, but l can't see the gear
well enough.

857
01:12:40,444 --> 01:12:41,559
I don't like this.

858
01:12:42,484 --> 01:12:44,122
-This isn't good.
-What?

859
01:12:44,324 --> 01:12:47,634
It's cutting awfully close to me.
She was just here, man.

860
01:12:47,844 --> 01:12:49,641
-Who was just here?
-Iris.

861
01:12:49,844 --> 01:12:50,640
Iris was here?

862
01:12:50,844 --> 01:12:54,803
She came by, shaking like a junkie,
wanted me to make a copy of some clip.

863
01:12:55,004 --> 01:12:55,720
What clip?

864
01:12:55,924 --> 01:12:58,518
I don't know.
She wouldn't let me see it.

865
01:12:58,724 --> 01:13:00,442
She was gonna give it to you.

866
01:13:00,644 --> 01:13:01,872
Like insurance.

867
01:13:02,124 --> 01:13:05,116
-She never gave me a tape.
-Think about what she said.

868
01:13:05,324 --> 01:13:08,157
She came into the bar crying.
She wanted to go to my car.

869
01:13:08,364 --> 01:13:10,958
Can we go to your car?
There's something you must see.

870
01:13:11,164 --> 01:13:13,075
-Something about my car.
-In your car.

871
01:13:26,684 --> 01:13:29,118
That's a handy little
attitude adjuster.

872
01:13:41,564 --> 01:13:43,475
Damn. I'm boxed in.

873
01:14:06,004 --> 01:14:07,232
What's it say?

874
01:14:07,444 --> 01:14:08,718
Nothing.

875
01:14:09,404 --> 01:14:11,201
Let's go play this back.

876
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:17,276
Give us the tape right now.

877
01:14:17,484 --> 01:14:19,440
What tape?
l'm trying to get my car--

878
01:14:19,644 --> 01:14:21,680
Shut the fuck up.

879
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:23,273
Give them the tape.

880
01:14:24,244 --> 01:14:27,475
It's in my case.
I'm gonna open my case.

881
01:14:27,924 --> 01:14:30,074
Facing us so we can see it.

882
01:14:42,724 --> 01:14:44,601
Take it and turn her loose, okay?

883
01:14:45,164 --> 01:14:47,394
Yeah. Absolutely.

884
01:15:14,084 --> 01:15:18,077
"No, we're not being followed, Lenny. "
"Don't be so paranoid, Lenny. "

885
01:15:50,684 --> 01:15:52,402
The glass is bullet-resistant.

886
01:15:52,604 --> 01:15:54,913
Whatever happened to bulletproof?

887
01:15:58,084 --> 01:16:00,154
Calm down, baby. This is what l do.

888
01:16:06,164 --> 01:16:07,313
Hang on!

889
01:16:34,764 --> 01:16:36,117
Oh, Christ.

890
01:17:09,444 --> 01:17:11,560
Goddamn it, 91 1 is busy!

891
01:17:11,764 --> 01:17:12,879
It's all right.

892
01:17:13,604 --> 01:17:15,560
They'd never make it in time, anyway.

893
01:17:25,204 --> 01:17:26,637
Oh, you're crazy.

894
01:17:52,804 --> 01:17:53,714
This is bad.

895
01:17:54,204 --> 01:17:55,717
The gas tank will go any second.

896
01:18:02,204 --> 01:18:03,353
Hold on.

897
01:18:15,324 --> 01:18:16,996
Are you out of your fucking mind?

898
01:18:17,244 --> 01:18:19,121
The fire's out, isn't it?

899
01:18:25,444 --> 01:18:29,232
Get in here, Lenny.
Come on, move it. Move!

900
01:18:48,964 --> 01:18:50,761
Get ready to hold your breath.

901
01:18:50,964 --> 01:18:53,956
Just kick out hard
and follow me, okay?

902
01:19:07,804 --> 01:19:09,317
Let's get out of here.

903
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:26,796
I can't believe you had to give
them the damn tape.

904
01:19:27,004 --> 01:19:28,642
Yeah, me neither.

905
01:19:29,124 --> 01:19:30,842
It was one of my favorites:

906
01:19:31,244 --> 01:19:34,236
Me and Faith in a hot tub
on my birthday.

907
01:19:36,804 --> 01:19:38,442
Are we impressed yet?

908
01:19:41,324 --> 01:19:42,757
Yeah, pretty impressed.

909
01:19:46,004 --> 01:19:48,564
Well, you got me missing the party
of the century.

910
01:19:48,764 --> 01:19:50,800
Like l ain't
got better to do.

911
01:19:51,004 --> 01:19:53,962
-Hey, Curtis? Just drive.
-This shit is whack.

912
01:19:54,204 --> 01:19:55,193
Those two were cops.

913
01:19:56,564 --> 01:19:58,202
-You sure?
-It's the walk.

914
01:19:58,404 --> 01:20:02,317
Anyway, they'll run your plates and get
your address. We gotta keep moving.

915
01:20:06,884 --> 01:20:08,317
What you doing all wet?

916
01:20:09,604 --> 01:20:11,515
Lornette, what's up?

917
01:20:12,444 --> 01:20:14,912
We'll watch fireworks
from Aunt Cecile's.

918
01:20:15,164 --> 01:20:18,395
-Aw, Mom!
-Come on, boy. Chop-chop. Come on.

919
01:20:18,684 --> 01:20:21,152
Come on, Zander.
We're going for a ride.

920
01:20:28,164 --> 01:20:29,756
-What's up?
-Get in the car.

921
01:20:29,964 --> 01:20:32,159
-What's going on, Nette?
-Now!

922
01:20:48,244 --> 01:20:50,075
Yo, what's up?

923
01:20:53,524 --> 01:20:55,276
Yo, Mace! What's up?

924
01:20:55,484 --> 01:20:58,954
-You don't come around here no more.
-I'm working, brother.

925
01:20:59,204 --> 01:21:01,513
-This is Lenny. He's with me.
-What's up?

926
01:21:01,724 --> 01:21:03,954
-Watch the fireworks.
-How you doing?

927
01:22:07,004 --> 01:22:08,198
Tell me.

928
01:22:09,244 --> 01:22:11,963
I can't tell you.
You've gotta see it.

929
01:22:12,164 --> 01:22:13,483
I'm not doing it.

930
01:22:14,284 --> 01:22:16,479
I know what you think
about the wire. . .

931
01:22:17,444 --> 01:22:19,833
. . .but you gotta see it.
It's that important.

932
01:22:39,604 --> 01:22:42,072
I'm sorry this has to be
your first playback.

933
01:22:44,764 --> 01:22:47,915
It's all right. Keep your eyes
closed or you'll see double.

934
01:22:55,204 --> 01:22:57,240
-Baby, yes.
-I'm gonna take you home.

935
01:22:58,604 --> 01:22:59,719
Thank you, Jeriko.

936
01:22:59,924 --> 01:23:03,803
Oh, l'll take you home.
You owe me two, you bastard.

937
01:23:04,004 --> 01:23:06,074
-That's right.
-Oh, you do?

938
01:23:06,284 --> 01:23:08,844
-I'll take you home.
-That's right.

939
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:10,995
-Me, baby.
-I'll work them all night.

940
01:23:20,164 --> 01:23:22,997
Lights, damn. Look at this, man.

941
01:23:23,524 --> 01:23:26,038
Oh, goddamn, man.
Just be cool, Jeriko.

942
01:23:26,244 --> 01:23:28,758
-Slow down.
-We don't need no problems.

943
01:23:28,964 --> 01:23:31,524
-I'm not speeding.
-Stop the fucking car.

944
01:23:31,804 --> 01:23:34,523
What's the matter, black man
can't own a Jeep?

945
01:23:35,244 --> 01:23:37,474
Go all the way
to the foot of the ramp.

946
01:23:37,684 --> 01:23:41,279
-No problems at all.
-Is this against the law in L.A.?

947
01:23:41,804 --> 01:23:45,877
If we be cool, they gonna be cool.
I can't afford no trouble.

948
01:23:50,124 --> 01:23:52,957
-A man can't do shit in this town.
-I ain't going back.

949
01:23:53,204 --> 01:23:57,277
-Shut up. Quiet.
-I don't give a fuck. I don't care.

950
01:23:57,484 --> 01:23:59,236
Driver, step out of the car.

951
01:23:59,804 --> 01:24:03,843
Get down on your knees;
put your hands on your head. Now!

952
01:24:04,084 --> 01:24:06,314
Everyone else, out of the car.

953
01:24:11,644 --> 01:24:14,317
Goddamn, man. What the hell
you pull me over for?

954
01:24:14,524 --> 01:24:17,084
If l was going any slower,
l'd have been parked.

955
01:24:17,284 --> 01:24:20,993
Get down on your knees and put
your hands behind your head.

956
01:24:21,204 --> 01:24:23,081
Put your hands on the hood.

957
01:24:23,444 --> 01:24:25,435
Don't move. You two, don't!

958
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:29,796
You stopped us because you had
suspects of our description.

959
01:24:30,004 --> 01:24:31,278
Is that what you'll say?

960
01:24:31,484 --> 01:24:35,796
What was the description?
Two black males in a car?

961
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:38,677
-I heard that one before.
-What the fuck?

962
01:24:39,484 --> 01:24:43,272
Well, you stopped the wrong black male
tonight, officer-- What is it?

963
01:24:43,484 --> 01:24:45,156
Steckler. Officer Steckler.

964
01:24:45,364 --> 01:24:48,242
I'm that 800-pound gorilla
in your mist, fucker.

965
01:24:48,444 --> 01:24:52,073
I make more in a day than you make
in a year, and my lawyer. . .

966
01:24:52,284 --> 01:24:56,721
. . .Ioves to spend my money dragging
Aryan robocops like you into court.

967
01:24:56,924 --> 01:24:59,882
Get a man down on the ground
with no probable cause.

968
01:25:00,124 --> 01:25:02,160
Shut the fuck up!

969
01:25:02,364 --> 01:25:04,673
-We weren't--
-Shut up and get back!

970
01:25:04,884 --> 01:25:07,114
-You all right?
-Motherfucker kicked me.

971
01:25:07,324 --> 01:25:10,555
-It's that rap bastard.
-You're that rapper puke?

972
01:25:11,164 --> 01:25:12,836
Jeriko One?

973
01:25:13,164 --> 01:25:17,203
You're the one getting all
the gangbangers going downtown. . .

974
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:19,235
. . .forming citizen groups. . .

975
01:25:19,444 --> 01:25:22,561
. . .trying to rake the LAPD
over a cheesegrater?

976
01:25:22,764 --> 01:25:25,642
That's right, and you're gonna be
in my next song.

977
01:25:25,844 --> 01:25:28,312
It's gonna be called "Robo-Steckler. "

978
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:32,122
It's all about a cop who met
his worst nightmare:

979
01:25:32,324 --> 01:25:36,715
A nigga with enough political juice
to squash his ass like a stink bug.

980
01:25:36,924 --> 01:25:38,642
You're gonna be famous, fucker.

981
01:25:38,844 --> 01:25:40,482
I don't think so.

982
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:45,516
Stop that bitch!

983
01:25:50,484 --> 01:25:51,837
Get her!

984
01:26:07,364 --> 01:26:08,513
Get her!

985
01:26:33,124 --> 01:26:34,398
Oh, God!

986
01:26:36,564 --> 01:26:37,679
Hang on. Hang on, Max.

987
01:26:42,324 --> 01:26:43,313
You see?

988
01:26:46,324 --> 01:26:47,313
You had to see it.

989
01:26:48,364 --> 01:26:51,561
I see the world opening up
and swallowing us all.

990
01:26:52,004 --> 01:26:53,517
Yeah, l know.

991
01:26:55,404 --> 01:26:56,803
Max, are you there?

992
01:26:57,324 --> 01:27:00,475
Meet me at Tick's in a half-hour.
And, Lenny. . .

993
01:27:00,684 --> 01:27:01,878
. . .don't get pulled over.

994
01:27:03,684 --> 01:27:06,278
You know what this tape could do
if it gets out?

995
01:27:07,844 --> 01:27:09,402
Yeah, l've got a pretty good idea.

996
01:27:10,004 --> 01:27:11,835
People finding out. . .

997
01:27:12,724 --> 01:27:14,157
. . .seeing. . .

998
01:27:15,324 --> 01:27:19,237
. . .that the LAPD just flat out
executed Jeriko One.

999
01:27:20,204 --> 01:27:21,683
Jesus.

1000
01:27:23,124 --> 01:27:24,637
Jesus.

1001
01:27:26,284 --> 01:27:28,400
Maybe they ought to see.

1002
01:27:29,404 --> 01:27:30,234
Maybe.

1003
01:27:30,764 --> 01:27:33,039
But tonight is probably not
the best night.

1004
01:27:42,564 --> 01:27:43,713
Come on.

1005
01:27:44,364 --> 01:27:45,592
We're rolling.

1006
01:27:53,844 --> 01:27:57,598
Those cops didn't do lris. Whoever
lris was wearing for killed her.

1007
01:27:57,804 --> 01:27:59,032
Why?

1008
01:27:59,244 --> 01:28:00,313
To break the trail.

1009
01:28:00,524 --> 01:28:03,243
If those cops had gotten hold of her,
they'd know who she was wearing for. . .

1010
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:04,923
. . .and then gone after them too.

1011
01:28:05,684 --> 01:28:08,244
Our killer is running as scared
as we are.

1012
01:28:08,604 --> 01:28:11,801
Which makes him really dangerous,
judging by how scared l am.

1013
01:28:42,164 --> 01:28:43,836
Sounds like Tick's already
celebrating.

1014
01:28:44,044 --> 01:28:45,636
You seem a little overdressed
for this party.

1015
01:28:45,844 --> 01:28:47,835
I want to look nice for you, Lenny.

1016
01:28:49,364 --> 01:28:51,958
Tick, l gotta talk to you.

1017
01:28:56,404 --> 01:28:57,723
Shit.

1018
01:29:10,724 --> 01:29:11,918
He's been cooked-off.

1019
01:29:14,084 --> 01:29:16,393
-Is he dead?
-No, but his frontal lobes. . .

1020
01:29:16,604 --> 01:29:17,832
. . .are like runny eggs.

1021
01:29:18,044 --> 01:29:21,400
They put an amplifier in-line
to boost the signal. . .

1022
01:29:21,604 --> 01:29:22,719
. . .and fried his brain.

1023
01:29:26,564 --> 01:29:27,519
It's Lenny.

1024
01:29:28,044 --> 01:29:29,477
Tick, come on!

1025
01:29:34,564 --> 01:29:35,679
Come on!

1026
01:29:36,564 --> 01:29:38,873
Come on, Tick, come on!

1027
01:29:40,204 --> 01:29:42,195
He's totally cut off from
the outside world.

1028
01:29:42,404 --> 01:29:43,598
How long does it last?

1029
01:29:44,844 --> 01:29:45,879
Forever.

1030
01:29:47,364 --> 01:29:49,719
Those two psycho cops are on
a slash-and-burn. . .

1031
01:29:49,924 --> 01:29:52,279
. . .to find the tape and cover
their tracks.

1032
01:29:53,164 --> 01:29:57,715
They want to find out what Tick knows.
If there are copies, who wired lris.

1033
01:29:57,924 --> 01:29:59,915
It won't get investigated
as a homicide. . .

1034
01:30:00,164 --> 01:30:01,882
. . .since he's technically alive.

1035
01:30:02,124 --> 01:30:04,001
That's right. He's technically alive.

1036
01:30:04,204 --> 01:30:06,957
Seems sophisticated for them.
They're not subtle.

1037
01:30:07,204 --> 01:30:09,115
There's more to this than you think.

1038
01:30:09,324 --> 01:30:10,313
What do you mean?

1039
01:30:12,284 --> 01:30:16,641
All l'm saying is, you don't know how
high up the food chain this goes.

1040
01:30:17,124 --> 01:30:19,160
-I've heard stuff.
-What stuff?

1041
01:30:19,364 --> 01:30:22,720
You know, l heard stuff. Smoke.
Rumors. I've heard stuff.

1042
01:30:23,644 --> 01:30:25,919
I've heard stuff about a death squad.

1043
01:30:27,084 --> 01:30:31,123
A group of guys, cops, loyal
to the hard-line school.

1044
01:30:31,404 --> 01:30:34,316
Guys that've had too many years
of city hall. . .

1045
01:30:34,524 --> 01:30:37,596
. . .review boards and the media
pissing down their necks. . .

1046
01:30:37,804 --> 01:30:40,238
. . .suspending cops right and left,
tying their hands. . .

1047
01:30:40,444 --> 01:30:43,197
. . .while out of the other side of
their mouths, these people. . .

1048
01:30:43,404 --> 01:30:46,157
. . .are squealing, "Save us!
Do something, you fucking morons. . .

1049
01:30:46,364 --> 01:30:48,400
. . .crime is totally out of control. "

1050
01:30:52,524 --> 01:30:54,116
Bullshit. It's conspiracy paranoia.

1051
01:30:54,324 --> 01:30:56,884
The issue isn't whether
you're paranoid.

1052
01:30:57,124 --> 01:30:59,194
The issue is whether you're
paranoid enough.

1053
01:30:59,444 --> 01:31:01,196
Christ!

1054
01:31:01,404 --> 01:31:03,235
Exactly. Get religion, man.

1055
01:31:03,444 --> 01:31:05,036
I love you like my own blood. . .

1056
01:31:05,284 --> 01:31:07,434
. . .but don't walk near me
in public, okay?

1057
01:31:07,724 --> 01:31:09,919
The only card we got to play
is the tape.

1058
01:31:10,164 --> 01:31:11,074
Get it to the media.

1059
01:31:11,324 --> 01:31:12,757
Yeah, right, blow it open.

1060
01:31:13,004 --> 01:31:15,882
No disrespect, but if it's
the 1 1 :00 news, by midnight. . .

1061
01:31:16,084 --> 01:31:18,314
. . .you got the biggest riot
in history.

1062
01:31:18,524 --> 01:31:21,482
So you're saying we just pretend
it didn't happen?

1063
01:31:21,684 --> 01:31:22,480
I didn't say that.

1064
01:31:22,724 --> 01:31:26,353
The LAPD executed one of the
most important black men in America.

1065
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:29,162
Who the fuck are you to bury it?

1066
01:31:29,364 --> 01:31:32,561
Trying to rake the LAPD over
a cheesegrater?

1067
01:31:32,964 --> 01:31:36,036
Fine. Do you want blood running
waist-deep in the storm drains?

1068
01:31:36,284 --> 01:31:40,994
Gangbangers'll spread like a wave
and burn this city to the ground.

1069
01:31:41,244 --> 01:31:44,759
When the fires start, the cops will
cap off anything that moves.

1070
01:31:45,284 --> 01:31:46,922
It'll be all-out war and you know it.

1071
01:31:47,164 --> 01:31:48,279
I don't think so.

1072
01:31:48,724 --> 01:31:50,396
Well, maybe it's time for a war!

1073
01:31:50,604 --> 01:31:52,196
You really want that on your head?

1074
01:31:54,364 --> 01:31:55,479
Really?

1075
01:31:57,884 --> 01:32:01,274
Whoever did lris did Tick.
It's the same sick wirehead shit.

1076
01:32:01,484 --> 01:32:03,554
Same reason, to burn the trail.

1077
01:32:03,764 --> 01:32:07,200
If Faith knows anything about this,
and she does. . . .

1078
01:32:07,404 --> 01:32:09,156
Somebody's gonna kill Faith?

1079
01:33:04,884 --> 01:33:07,444
Jesus! You scared the fuck out of me.

1080
01:33:07,884 --> 01:33:09,033
What do you want?

1081
01:33:09,284 --> 01:33:11,798
We know about Jeriko.
Iris made me a copy of the tape.

1082
01:33:12,044 --> 01:33:14,842
Goddamn it. I was trying to
keep you out of this.

1083
01:33:15,044 --> 01:33:16,272
I know. How did it happen?

1084
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:19,084
What was lris doing riding around
with Jeriko, wearing a wire?

1085
01:33:19,324 --> 01:33:21,519
Faith, listen. Look at me!

1086
01:33:21,764 --> 01:33:24,437
You gotta trust us, we're here
to help you.

1087
01:33:26,204 --> 01:33:27,842
All right, l'll talk to you alone.

1088
01:33:28,044 --> 01:33:29,796
-Mace is in this.
-Tell us.

1089
01:33:36,804 --> 01:33:39,716
Philo's gotten obsessed with playback.

1090
01:33:40,364 --> 01:33:41,877
He's a total wiretrip junkie.

1091
01:33:42,724 --> 01:33:45,796
He's such a control freak,
he's having people followed.

1092
01:33:46,044 --> 01:33:48,319
He's recording his business
partners' calls.

1093
01:33:48,524 --> 01:33:50,162
He's wiring up people left and right.

1094
01:33:51,964 --> 01:33:55,513
Philo and Jeriko didn't get along.
He thought Jeriko might dump him. . .

1095
01:33:55,764 --> 01:33:58,756
. . .but he wasn't sure, so he started
with the surveillance.

1096
01:33:59,004 --> 01:34:01,438
A couple nights ago, he wires up lris.

1097
01:34:01,684 --> 01:34:05,836
He sends her and the other girl,
Diamanda, over to Jeriko's table.

1098
01:34:09,084 --> 01:34:13,077
Hi, baby. My name's lris.

1099
01:34:15,564 --> 01:34:17,361
I've got a present for you.

1100
01:34:18,244 --> 01:34:19,643
You're so beautiful.

1101
01:34:21,364 --> 01:34:25,357
So that night, lris calls up crying.
She's freaking out.

1102
01:34:25,564 --> 01:34:27,555
She comes over and plays the tape.

1103
01:34:27,764 --> 01:34:29,516
Philo loses it.

1104
01:34:29,764 --> 01:34:31,720
He can't believe what
a disaster it is.

1105
01:34:32,204 --> 01:34:35,321
He's afraid the cops will beat it out
of her who she's been working for. . .

1106
01:34:35,524 --> 01:34:37,515
. . .and come looking for him.

1107
01:34:40,844 --> 01:34:42,721
Why not go public and save himself?

1108
01:34:42,924 --> 01:34:45,643
If it got out that he had his own
artists under surveillance. . .

1109
01:34:45,884 --> 01:34:48,717
. . .he'd lose all his other acts and
it'd be over for him.

1110
01:35:10,684 --> 01:35:12,754
So he gave lris some money. . .

1111
01:35:12,964 --> 01:35:15,876
. . .and tells her to check into
a hotel under an assumed name. . .

1112
01:35:16,084 --> 01:35:17,722
. . .so he can figure out what to do.

1113
01:35:17,964 --> 01:35:19,397
He figured out what to do all right.

1114
01:35:19,884 --> 01:35:21,078
You think he killed her?

1115
01:35:21,364 --> 01:35:23,241
The killer knew where she was.

1116
01:35:25,724 --> 01:35:27,203
What a nightmare.

1117
01:35:27,484 --> 01:35:30,999
I don't know where the fuck she is,
but we're late. Let's go.

1118
01:35:31,444 --> 01:35:33,878
Listen, how do you want me
to work tonight?

1119
01:35:34,084 --> 01:35:36,996
At the Bonaventure, you want me
at the party or the suite?

1120
01:35:38,604 --> 01:35:40,242
Leave here with me, right now.

1121
01:35:43,324 --> 01:35:44,040
Come on.

1122
01:35:44,284 --> 01:35:45,763
-We talk later.
-I need to know.

1123
01:35:45,964 --> 01:35:47,682
Upstairs, downstairs,
where will you be?

1124
01:35:47,884 --> 01:35:50,523
Go get her, go!

1125
01:35:52,284 --> 01:35:54,275
I just say things once, baby, so. . .

1126
01:35:54,484 --> 01:35:56,952
. . .we'll talk about that later.

1127
01:35:57,204 --> 01:35:59,513
Okay, man. I'm cool, l'm sorry.

1128
01:35:59,724 --> 01:36:02,318
Wait. Go for a pass, bro.

1129
01:36:23,644 --> 01:36:24,599
Shit!

1130
01:36:24,804 --> 01:36:26,442
Go! Out of my fucking way!

1131
01:36:28,524 --> 01:36:30,435
Come on!

1132
01:36:32,484 --> 01:36:34,281
Go! Go!

1133
01:36:36,204 --> 01:36:38,160
Pardon me! Sorry, sorry!

1134
01:36:38,484 --> 01:36:40,475
Get out of my fucking way!
Move it!

1135
01:36:40,684 --> 01:36:41,594
Move!

1136
01:36:44,924 --> 01:36:45,959
You're finished!

1137
01:36:49,004 --> 01:36:51,564
Let's go, darling, walk with me.
Happy New Year!

1138
01:37:02,684 --> 01:37:04,037
Get out of the way!

1139
01:37:04,284 --> 01:37:05,558
Excuse me!

1140
01:37:05,804 --> 01:37:07,078
Out of my fucking way!

1141
01:37:10,964 --> 01:37:13,603
Not now, baby.

1142
01:37:14,964 --> 01:37:16,238
Not here.

1143
01:37:54,684 --> 01:37:57,152
Well, l'm certainly in the mood
for a party.

1144
01:37:57,364 --> 01:38:00,595
-Wait. I'll take her up to the suite.
-No problem.

1145
01:38:01,004 --> 01:38:02,915
You'll have a glass of champagne. . .

1146
01:38:03,604 --> 01:38:05,003
. . .or six.

1147
01:38:05,284 --> 01:38:08,037
I'll be up in a bit to help you
ring in the New Year.

1148
01:38:11,884 --> 01:38:13,840
I live for the moment.

1149
01:38:14,604 --> 01:38:16,834
Pussy-whipped,
sorry-ass motherfucker.

1150
01:38:19,444 --> 01:38:21,002
Take it easy.

1151
01:38:21,324 --> 01:38:22,473
So where are they now?

1152
01:38:22,724 --> 01:38:25,033
He's got her up in the room,
under guard.

1153
01:38:25,444 --> 01:38:27,560
And he's still working the party. . .

1154
01:38:27,764 --> 01:38:30,278
. . .acting smooth like
nothing's nothing.

1155
01:38:30,524 --> 01:38:32,913
So, buddy, l say we work a trade.

1156
01:38:33,164 --> 01:38:34,279
-What do you mean?
-Give him the clip.

1157
01:38:34,484 --> 01:38:38,636
It's brilliant. The tape for Faith.
He'll go for it, l can set it up.

1158
01:38:38,884 --> 01:38:41,762
This is what we laughingly refer
to as a plan, right?

1159
01:38:41,964 --> 01:38:43,795
Just get your butt down here.

1160
01:38:44,004 --> 01:38:48,122
If l'm not at the party downstairs, go
to the room. It's 2203. You writing?

1161
01:38:48,364 --> 01:38:51,322
2-2-0-3.

1162
01:38:51,604 --> 01:38:54,835
If he gives us any shit,
we kill them all.

1163
01:38:55,044 --> 01:38:57,194
What do you say?
Release him to the pigeons.

1164
01:38:58,284 --> 01:39:00,195
Okay, we got to get over there.

1165
01:39:00,844 --> 01:39:04,041
-Can you borrow a dress from Cecile?
-I'm not going.

1166
01:39:05,004 --> 01:39:06,960
We're going! Gant'll do her--

1167
01:39:07,204 --> 01:39:08,603
Shut up.

1168
01:39:08,844 --> 01:39:10,596
Park your mouth and listen.

1169
01:39:10,884 --> 01:39:12,761
It's a setup. Think about it!

1170
01:39:12,964 --> 01:39:16,161
Why send you the tapes?
Get you to rush in without thinking?

1171
01:39:16,404 --> 01:39:19,441
Put a bullet in you, one in her,
put the gun in your hand?

1172
01:39:19,764 --> 01:39:21,243
That sounds right.

1173
01:39:21,484 --> 01:39:22,439
I'm going.

1174
01:39:23,044 --> 01:39:25,399
You'll get yourself killed for this?

1175
01:39:25,764 --> 01:39:27,834
For this toxic-waste bitch!

1176
01:39:28,044 --> 01:39:29,841
What the fuck are you doing?!

1177
01:39:34,724 --> 01:39:38,034
This is your life!
Right here, right now.

1178
01:39:38,284 --> 01:39:41,560
This is real time, you hear me?
Real time!

1179
01:39:41,804 --> 01:39:43,237
Time to get real. No playback.

1180
01:39:43,604 --> 01:39:45,242
You understand me?

1181
01:39:45,724 --> 01:39:47,396
She doesn't love you anymore.

1182
01:39:47,604 --> 01:39:50,243
Maybe she did once, l don't know,
but she doesn't now.

1183
01:39:50,724 --> 01:39:55,195
These are used emotions.
It's time to trade them in.

1184
01:39:55,884 --> 01:39:58,762
Lenny, memories were meant to fade.

1185
01:39:59,404 --> 01:40:01,713
They're designed that way
for a reason.

1186
01:40:05,204 --> 01:40:07,399
Have you ever been in love with. . .

1187
01:40:08,084 --> 01:40:10,518
. . .someone who didn't return
that love?

1188
01:40:12,484 --> 01:40:13,803
Yeah, Lenny.

1189
01:40:15,084 --> 01:40:16,403
I have.

1190
01:40:18,884 --> 01:40:21,114
It didn't stop you from loving them,
right?

1191
01:40:21,324 --> 01:40:26,444
Or being able to understand them,
or forgive them?

1192
01:40:27,924 --> 01:40:29,482
I guess.

1193
01:40:30,884 --> 01:40:33,478
Didn't stop you from wanting
to protect them.

1194
01:40:34,484 --> 01:40:35,439
Did it?

1195
01:40:44,164 --> 01:40:46,837
When l met Faith she was just
another. . .

1196
01:40:47,284 --> 01:40:49,002
. . .another runaway. . .

1197
01:40:49,284 --> 01:40:52,162
. . .giving $20 blowjobs
to buy crank.

1198
01:40:53,524 --> 01:40:55,992
Another lost soul.

1199
01:40:57,524 --> 01:41:00,516
And she had this voice.

1200
01:41:01,644 --> 01:41:03,077
It was scary.

1201
01:41:04,844 --> 01:41:08,314
Like she could take all the hurt
and rage of the entire world. . .

1202
01:41:08,524 --> 01:41:11,084
. . .and lift it up to heaven
in one voice.

1203
01:41:12,404 --> 01:41:14,076
I helped her.

1204
01:41:15,204 --> 01:41:18,913
And l promised her that l'd always
just be there. . .

1205
01:41:19,444 --> 01:41:20,877
. . .to protect her.

1206
01:41:23,724 --> 01:41:27,399
It's not about what's in her head.
It's what's in mine.

1207
01:41:28,524 --> 01:41:30,833
I can't let go of the promise.

1208
01:41:31,884 --> 01:41:34,717
It's like, it's all l have left.

1209
01:41:45,324 --> 01:41:46,916
No, it's not.

1210
01:41:59,404 --> 01:42:00,553
Come on.

1211
01:42:02,164 --> 01:42:03,756
Let's go to a party.

1212
01:43:20,684 --> 01:43:21,514
Shit!

1213
01:43:23,084 --> 01:43:24,437
Let's bail.

1214
01:43:33,404 --> 01:43:35,713
You look great in that dress.

1215
01:43:36,244 --> 01:43:37,279
Better than l would.

1216
01:43:38,284 --> 01:43:39,876
Thank you. I think.

1217
01:43:40,204 --> 01:43:41,159
Come on, let's go!

1218
01:44:06,164 --> 01:44:08,724
How do we get into
the biggest party in history?

1219
01:44:08,924 --> 01:44:11,757
Relax, Mace, this is what l do.

1220
01:44:31,044 --> 01:44:32,363
You see Gant?

1221
01:44:42,324 --> 01:44:43,279
Shit.

1222
01:44:53,804 --> 01:44:56,523
Come on, Max. Come on, buddy.

1223
01:44:59,404 --> 01:45:02,953
Your call is unavailable or
has traveled....

1224
01:45:03,164 --> 01:45:05,553
I still got one ace to play.

1225
01:45:05,764 --> 01:45:07,834
Gant's got what l want
and l've got what he wants.

1226
01:45:08,044 --> 01:45:09,682
That's the original.
There are no copies.

1227
01:45:09,964 --> 01:45:11,556
That's why it's a makeable deal.

1228
01:45:11,964 --> 01:45:15,240
Look, this tape is
a lightning bolt from God.

1229
01:45:15,444 --> 01:45:17,674
It's worth more than you,
more than me. . .

1230
01:45:17,924 --> 01:45:20,757
. . .and more than Faith.
You understand?

1231
01:45:21,004 --> 01:45:21,993
It can change things.

1232
01:45:22,244 --> 01:45:25,077
Things that need changing before
we all go off the road.

1233
01:45:25,284 --> 01:45:28,321
And you do not have the right
to use it for currency.

1234
01:45:28,564 --> 01:45:31,715
So if you go, you go alone.

1235
01:45:32,244 --> 01:45:36,442
I care about you, Lenny.
A lot more than you know. . .

1236
01:45:36,644 --> 01:45:39,317
. . .which makes us both pretty stupid.

1237
01:45:39,524 --> 01:45:41,640
But if you pawn this tape. . .

1238
01:45:43,004 --> 01:45:44,960
. . .you mean nothing to me.

1239
01:45:59,604 --> 01:46:01,003
Excuse me.

1240
01:46:02,604 --> 01:46:03,878
Excuse me.

1241
01:46:12,284 --> 01:46:13,399
See that guy over there?

1242
01:46:14,844 --> 01:46:16,994
That's Deputy Commissioner
Palmer Strickland.

1243
01:46:17,244 --> 01:46:18,962
The prick who busted me out.

1244
01:46:19,204 --> 01:46:21,957
His ass is so tight, when he farts
only dogs hear it.

1245
01:46:22,204 --> 01:46:25,514
If there's one cop who's not dirty,
it's him. Take it to him.

1246
01:46:26,044 --> 01:46:27,557
You want me to trust a cop?!

1247
01:46:27,764 --> 01:46:30,801
No. Trust me. Here.

1248
01:46:35,604 --> 01:46:36,514
What if you're wrong?

1249
01:46:41,964 --> 01:46:43,079
Go.

1250
01:46:51,084 --> 01:46:52,517
Excuse me.

1251
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:14,993
Commissioner?

1252
01:47:15,684 --> 01:47:18,437
There's a clip in here you need
to see right now.

1253
01:47:20,204 --> 01:47:24,163
If it wasn't New Year's Eve, l'd
arrest you for illegal equipment.

1254
01:47:24,724 --> 01:47:25,873
Just look at the clip.

1255
01:47:26,084 --> 01:47:29,394
You want to know who killed Jeriko?
Go in the stall and hit "play. "

1256
01:47:29,604 --> 01:47:31,322
Sir, is there a problem here?

1257
01:47:33,164 --> 01:47:34,882
Damn it. I knew it.

1258
01:47:35,564 --> 01:47:37,202
Let go of me!

1259
01:47:44,244 --> 01:47:47,395
Wade, can we talk here,
like two human beings--

1260
01:47:52,364 --> 01:47:53,353
It's nothing personal.

1261
01:47:58,084 --> 01:47:59,483
Remember me, you fucking bitch?

1262
01:48:01,364 --> 01:48:02,956
Come on, come on!

1263
01:48:13,284 --> 01:48:14,273
What are you looking at?

1264
01:48:19,284 --> 01:48:20,399
Goddamn it!

1265
01:48:24,284 --> 01:48:25,353
Enjoy the party.

1266
01:50:28,164 --> 01:50:29,313
Fuck!

1267
01:50:36,164 --> 01:50:37,882
I didn't hear you come in.

1268
01:50:58,244 --> 01:50:59,313
No!

1269
01:53:34,844 --> 01:53:36,197
Okay?

1270
01:53:40,484 --> 01:53:41,883
Did l hurt you?

1271
01:53:44,444 --> 01:53:46,116
I love you, Max.

1272
01:53:49,564 --> 01:53:52,362
You're so pretty, Faith.

1273
01:53:53,284 --> 01:53:55,514
Come here! Come here!

1274
01:53:55,804 --> 01:53:58,034
Fuck you. You want to fucking die?!

1275
01:53:58,244 --> 01:54:00,997
You want to fucking die?!
You want to fucking die?!

1276
01:54:01,244 --> 01:54:04,236
This piece of puke hired me to kill
you, baby. Can you believe that?

1277
01:54:04,444 --> 01:54:06,753
-Isn't that right, Gant?
-Oh, my God. I don't believe this.

1278
01:54:06,964 --> 01:54:11,355
Believe it. Now bring me the 'trodes.
Come on, quick.

1279
01:54:11,564 --> 01:54:13,520
Come here, big shot. Suck on this.

1280
01:54:13,724 --> 01:54:15,362
Want to suck on some, suck on this!

1281
01:54:15,564 --> 01:54:18,158
What are you going to do?
You can't just kill him.

1282
01:54:18,364 --> 01:54:22,073
Give me that. I won't kill him.
Just a little poach job.

1283
01:54:23,484 --> 01:54:26,715
You shut the fuck up! Shut up!
Shut up!

1284
01:54:26,924 --> 01:54:29,154
I'm going to pull this fucking
trigger!

1285
01:54:30,084 --> 01:54:31,073
Fuck!

1286
01:54:33,364 --> 01:54:35,355
Here's how much l love you, baby.

1287
01:54:35,724 --> 01:54:36,713
God, Max!

1288
01:54:36,924 --> 01:54:39,802
Hope you enjoy the show, Philo.

1289
01:54:40,084 --> 01:54:41,403
Fuck.

1290
01:54:43,924 --> 01:54:46,643
-Take it, you prick!
-No, Max, don't!

1291
01:54:46,844 --> 01:54:47,913
Take it!

1292
01:54:48,924 --> 01:54:50,198
Take it!

1293
01:54:50,404 --> 01:54:53,077
Take it, take it!

1294
01:55:08,284 --> 01:55:11,640
Don't make any assumptions about
our friendship, Lenny.

1295
01:55:22,004 --> 01:55:23,756
I didn't know you were colorblind,
Max.

1296
01:55:24,204 --> 01:55:26,513
Only way l could stand your ties.

1297
01:55:33,164 --> 01:55:34,836
Glock 23.

1298
01:55:35,084 --> 01:55:36,278
Nice.

1299
01:55:37,604 --> 01:55:38,719
Where's Faith?

1300
01:55:39,004 --> 01:55:40,198
I sent her to the party.

1301
01:55:40,684 --> 01:55:42,595
I figured l'd wait up here
until you killed Gant.

1302
01:55:42,844 --> 01:55:44,357
Why would l kill Gant?

1303
01:55:45,604 --> 01:55:46,753
You just did.

1304
01:55:47,004 --> 01:55:48,323
Jesus.

1305
01:55:48,564 --> 01:55:52,523
Statistically, that's the word
people use just before they die.

1306
01:55:52,764 --> 01:55:55,039
Shit being number one.

1307
01:55:55,284 --> 01:55:59,914
I killed Gant and you ran in,
and being on his payroll. . .

1308
01:56:00,124 --> 01:56:01,079
. . .you shot me.

1309
01:56:01,324 --> 01:56:02,803
That's about the way it happened.

1310
01:56:03,044 --> 01:56:05,717
Wait, now l remember.
I killed lris too, didn't l?

1311
01:56:05,964 --> 01:56:09,274
That's right. They'll find the
original snuff clip in your apartment.

1312
01:56:09,524 --> 01:56:11,799
The one l gave you at the club
was a copy.

1313
01:56:12,044 --> 01:56:14,683
Was l busy? Did l do Tick too?

1314
01:56:14,924 --> 01:56:15,879
You bet. Like it?

1315
01:56:16,124 --> 01:56:17,273
Why, Max?

1316
01:56:19,044 --> 01:56:20,921
Why did you have to do lris?

1317
01:56:21,204 --> 01:56:25,038
I feel l have to share this with
someone because it's too perfect.

1318
01:56:25,284 --> 01:56:26,922
Don't worry, l won't say anything.

1319
01:56:27,164 --> 01:56:28,597
Oh, l know.

1320
01:56:29,364 --> 01:56:31,195
So l'm working for this puke, right?

1321
01:56:31,444 --> 01:56:34,004
He says he'll pay me large
to do the hooker. . .

1322
01:56:34,244 --> 01:56:38,522
. . .but l also have to do his bitch
girlfriend because she knows the score.

1323
01:56:38,764 --> 01:56:41,119
Only he doesn't know
about me and Faith.

1324
01:56:41,364 --> 01:56:44,515
I say to myself, "lf l turn him
down, he'll get someone else.

1325
01:56:44,764 --> 01:56:47,324
And l lose Faith. "

1326
01:56:47,564 --> 01:56:48,758
To coin a phrase.

1327
01:56:49,524 --> 01:56:51,640
So to buy some time,
l do the skank. . .

1328
01:56:51,884 --> 01:56:54,523
. . .but l still gotta deal with Gant.
It's him or me.

1329
01:56:54,764 --> 01:56:57,562
But l can't just cap him without
some chump. . .

1330
01:56:57,804 --> 01:56:59,522
. . .to take the fall.
And who better. . .

1331
01:56:59,764 --> 01:57:02,881
. . .than his girlfriend's loser
ex-boyfriend.

1332
01:57:03,124 --> 01:57:06,161
A known criminal who's been seen
hassling him in public.

1333
01:57:06,404 --> 01:57:10,602
Who is, regrettably, also your
best-fucking-friend.

1334
01:57:10,844 --> 01:57:12,482
No plan is perfect, Lenny.

1335
01:57:13,604 --> 01:57:15,993
Cheer up. World's ending
in 1 0 minutes anyway.

1336
01:57:16,244 --> 01:57:18,121
You must be so pleased.

1337
01:57:18,964 --> 01:57:23,480
I followed your jellybean trail right
here, just like a good little chump.

1338
01:57:23,724 --> 01:57:26,033
You got ahead of me a couple times.

1339
01:57:26,284 --> 01:57:27,637
Remember the death squad?

1340
01:57:27,884 --> 01:57:29,920
I had to keep
you from going to the cops.

1341
01:57:30,164 --> 01:57:32,314
--stuff about a death squad.

1342
01:57:32,564 --> 01:57:35,283
The issue is not whether you're
paranoid, Lenny.

1343
01:57:35,524 --> 01:57:37,162
It's whether you're paranoid enough.

1344
01:57:37,404 --> 01:57:39,599
-So there wasn't a death squad?
-No.

1345
01:57:39,844 --> 01:57:42,722
Just two loose-cannon cops
covering their butts?

1346
01:57:42,964 --> 01:57:46,957
Pretty zany, huh? All this
caused by a random traffic stop.

1347
01:57:47,604 --> 01:57:49,674
Nothing means nothing.
You know that.

1348
01:57:49,924 --> 01:57:52,438
Look around.
The whole planet's in chaos.

1349
01:57:52,684 --> 01:57:54,720
The day of reckoning is upon us.

1350
01:57:54,964 --> 01:57:57,159
Get what you can, while you can. . .

1351
01:57:57,404 --> 01:58:00,476
. . .because some shit can put a .22
in the back of your head. . .

1352
01:58:01,404 --> 01:58:02,280
. . .any second.

1353
01:58:05,804 --> 01:58:07,362
How'd you hook up with Faith?

1354
01:58:09,804 --> 01:58:13,638
This fuck hires me a month ago
to eyeball her, only. . .

1355
01:58:13,884 --> 01:58:15,840
. . .Faith knows me from you.

1356
01:58:16,084 --> 01:58:19,156
So she says to me,
"Max, why are you following me?"

1357
01:58:19,404 --> 01:58:22,953
And l say, "l'll buy you
a drink and l'll explain. "

1358
01:58:23,204 --> 01:58:27,117
-Then she says, "So--"
-Do you enjoy watching me?

1359
01:58:29,284 --> 01:58:31,514
You're supposed to go downstairs.
Go downstairs.

1360
01:58:31,724 --> 01:58:35,558
I know. I don't always do what
l'm told, you know that.

1361
01:58:35,804 --> 01:58:40,753
So l said, "Do you enjoy watching me?
Come on, Max. Play with me. "

1362
01:58:41,004 --> 01:58:42,915
And then what did you say?

1363
01:58:43,764 --> 01:58:45,834
I said, "Yeah, l'd even
do it for free. "

1364
01:58:47,204 --> 01:58:51,800
I said, "That's good, because l like
the feeling of being watched.

1365
01:58:52,044 --> 01:58:54,160
I acquired the taste from Lenny. "

1366
01:58:54,404 --> 01:58:55,393
And then she said:

1367
01:58:56,364 --> 01:58:59,481
"Since we're going to be spending
so much time together--"

1368
01:58:59,684 --> 01:59:02,244
"Why don't we make the best of it?"

1369
01:59:11,484 --> 01:59:13,122
The very best.

1370
01:59:14,964 --> 01:59:17,478
You know all about that,
don't you, Lenny?

1371
01:59:18,284 --> 01:59:21,879
Faith and me found a place you
could never reach, Max.

1372
01:59:22,124 --> 01:59:23,273
Never.

1373
01:59:24,404 --> 01:59:28,602
Faith, l know it's gone. . .

1374
01:59:29,564 --> 01:59:32,601
. . .but, Max, you can't
fucking touch it.

1375
01:59:33,724 --> 01:59:35,123
Enjoy it.

1376
01:59:35,724 --> 01:59:36,679
Wait!

1377
01:59:41,364 --> 01:59:42,922
Fucking bitch!

1378
01:59:48,604 --> 01:59:50,083
Shit!

1379
02:01:20,204 --> 02:01:22,479
Motherfucker, you're going down!

1380
02:01:25,644 --> 02:01:26,759
Come here!

1381
02:01:46,924 --> 02:01:48,721
Come here. Come here, Lenny!

1382
02:01:48,964 --> 02:01:51,319
I'm taking you with me, motherfucker.
Come here!

1383
02:01:51,524 --> 02:01:53,242
Come with me! Come here!

1384
02:01:54,364 --> 02:01:55,558
Fuck!

1385
02:03:02,324 --> 02:03:03,473
There she is!

1386
02:04:20,164 --> 02:04:21,677
Freeze!

1387
02:04:22,404 --> 02:04:24,122
I said, fucking freeze!

1388
02:04:38,604 --> 02:04:41,960
Down! All the way down!
Right now!

1389
02:04:42,604 --> 02:04:44,913
