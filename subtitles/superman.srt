"In the decade of the 1930s
even the great city of Metropolis...

3
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,053
"...was not spared the ravages
of the world-wide depression.

4
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:51,127
"In the times of fear and confusion...

5
00:00:51,396 --> 00:00:55,264
"...the job of informing the public
was the responsibility...

6
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:56,767
"...of the Daily Planet.

7
00:00:56,835 --> 00:00:59,099
"A great metropolitan newspaper...

8
00:00:59,171 --> 00:01:04,302
"...whose reputation for clarity and truth
had become a symbol of hope...

9
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,400
"...for the city of Metropolis. "

10
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:43,107
This is no fantasy.

11
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:47,377
No careless product of wild imagination.

12
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:50,044
No, my good friends...

13
00:06:52,023 --> 00:06:53,786
...these indictments...

14
00:06:55,493 --> 00:06:57,461
...I’ve brought you today...

15
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:02,490
...specific charges listed herein
against the individuals...

16
00:07:03,435 --> 00:07:07,337
...their acts of treason.
Their ultimate aim of sedition.

17
00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:11,634
These...

18
00:07:13,945 --> 00:07:16,641
...are matters of undeniable fact.

19
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:23,151
I ask you now to pronounce judgment...

20
00:07:24,322 --> 00:07:25,983
...on those accused.

21
00:07:33,264 --> 00:07:34,959
On this...

22
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:37,731
...this mindless aberration...

23
00:07:37,902 --> 00:07:42,032
...whose only means of expression
are wanton violence and destruction.

24
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,741
On the woman Ursa...

25
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:50,375
...whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...

26
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:54,350
...have threatened even the children
of the planet Krypton.

27
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:05,086
Finally, General Zod.

28
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:08,564
Once trusted by this Council...

29
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:12,496
...charged with maintaining the defense
of the planet Krypton itself.

30
00:08:12,837 --> 00:08:17,069
Chief Architect of this intended revolution
and author of this insidious plot...

31
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:20,410
...to establish a new order amongst us...

32
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:24,611
...with himself as absolute ruler.

33
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:29,014
You have heard the evidence.

34
00:08:30,522 --> 00:08:32,956
The decision of the Council
will now be heard.

35
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:33,820
Guilty!

36
00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:37,054
Guilty!

37
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,619
Guilty!

38
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:44,932
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El.

39
00:08:46,004 --> 00:08:48,268
It has therefore now become your decision.

40
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:50,866
You alone will condemn us if you wish...

41
00:08:51,142 --> 00:08:53,770
...and you alone will be held responsible
by me!

42
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:03,617
Join us!

43
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,882
You have been known to disagree
with the Council before.

44
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:13,754
Yours could become an important voice
in the new order, second only to my own!

45
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:18,059
I offer you a chance for greatness, Jor-El!

46
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:20,430
Take it! Join us!

47
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,504
You will bow down before me, Jor-El.

48
00:09:24,943 --> 00:09:28,106
I swear it!
No matter that it takes an eternity!

49
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,048
You will bow down before me!

50
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,983
Both you and then one day...

51
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:35,349
...your heirs!

52
00:11:05,276 --> 00:11:09,269
Forgive me, forgive me....

53
00:11:26,998 --> 00:11:31,128
An unpleasant duty
has been masterly performed, Jor-El.

54
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:34,300
They have received the fate they deserved.

55
00:11:34,872 --> 00:11:37,363
Isolation in the Phantom Zone...

56
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:39,569
...an eternal living death.

57
00:11:41,012 --> 00:11:43,742
A chance for life, nonetheless.

58
00:11:44,782 --> 00:11:45,908
As opposed to us.

59
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:48,814
It’s suicide.

60
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,148
No, it’s worse, it’s genocide.

61
00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:54,222
Be warned, Jor-El.

62
00:11:54,726 --> 00:11:58,685
The Council has already evaluated
this outlandish theory of yours.

63
00:12:00,231 --> 00:12:03,394
My friends, you know me
to be neither rash nor impulsive.

64
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:08,605
I am not given
to wild unsupported statements...

65
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:12,970
...and I tell you that we must evacuate
this planet immediately.

66
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:17,281
Jor-El, you are one
of Krypton’s greatest scientists.

67
00:12:17,515 --> 00:12:19,312
Yes, but so is Vond-Ah.

68
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:26,214
I don’t question your data.

69
00:12:26,824 --> 00:12:28,348
The facts are undeniable.

70
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,662
It’s your conclusions
we find unsupportable.

71
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:40,694
This planet will explode within 30 days.

72
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,028
If not sooner.

73
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:45,308
I tell you Krypton
is simply shifting its orbit.

74
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:47,007
Jor-El...

75
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:49,411
...be reasonable.

76
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:52,509
My friend...

77
00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:58,447
...l have never been otherwise.
This madness is yours.

78
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,485
This discussion is terminated.

79
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:04,627
The decision of the Council is final.

80
00:13:24,349 --> 00:13:26,408
Any attempt by you to create...

81
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:30,250
...a climate of fear and panic
among the populace...

82
00:13:30,388 --> 00:13:34,119
...must be deemed by us
an act of insurrection.

83
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:36,884
You would accuse me of insurrection?

84
00:13:38,162 --> 00:13:40,653
Has it now become a crime to cherish life?

85
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:44,900
You would be banished
to endless imprisonment...

86
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,935
...in the Phantom Zone:

87
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:48,839
The eternal void...

88
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:52,000
...which you, yourself discovered.

89
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:57,511
Will you abide by the Council’s decision?

90
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:04,578
I will remain silent.

91
00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:07,749
Neither l...

92
00:14:08,526 --> 00:14:11,086
...nor my wife, will leave Krypton.

93
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:08,377
Have you finished?

94
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:12,485
Nearly.

95
00:15:18,396 --> 00:15:20,023
It’s the only answer, Lara.

96
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:21,961
If he remains here with us...

97
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:25,459
...he will die as surely as we will.

98
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:26,934
But why Earth, Jor-El?

99
00:15:27,338 --> 00:15:29,772
They’re primitives,
thousands of years behind us.

100
00:15:30,174 --> 00:15:32,472
He will need that advantage to survive.

101
00:15:34,912 --> 00:15:36,573
Their atmosphere will...

102
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,440
...sustain him.

103
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,422
He will defy their gravity.

104
00:15:49,627 --> 00:15:51,527
He will look like one of them.

105
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:54,428
He won’t be one of them.

106
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:55,896
No.

107
00:15:56,801 --> 00:15:59,998
His dense molecular structure
will make him strong.

108
00:16:01,806 --> 00:16:04,274
He’ll be odd. Different.

109
00:16:06,444 --> 00:16:09,538
He’ll be fast. Virtually invulnerable.

110
00:16:11,115 --> 00:16:13,845
Isolated. Alone.

111
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:19,554
He will not be alone.

112
00:16:25,796 --> 00:16:27,491
He will never be alone.

113
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:40,209
The energy input to Jor-El’s quarters
is now in excess.

114
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:43,607
Our data indicates the loss
is due to a misuse of energy.

115
00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:45,676
Investigate.

116
00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:49,476
And if the investigation proves correct?

117
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:53,782
He knew the penalty he faced.

118
00:16:55,393 --> 00:16:57,361
He even is a member of this Council.

119
00:16:59,764 --> 00:17:01,698
The law will be upheld.

120
00:17:43,608 --> 00:17:47,066
You will travel far, my little Kal-El.

121
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:51,071
But we will never leave you.

122
00:17:52,683 --> 00:17:54,412
Even in the face of our death...

123
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,685
...the richness of our lives...

124
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,023
...shall be yours.

125
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,761
All that I have, all that I've learned,
everything I feel...

126
00:18:07,298 --> 00:18:08,856
...all this and more, l...

127
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:12,964
...l bequeath you, my son.

128
00:18:16,707 --> 00:18:18,607
You will carry me inside you...

129
00:18:19,944 --> 00:18:21,878
...all the days of your life.

130
00:18:23,814 --> 00:18:25,782
You will make my strength your own...

131
00:18:26,617 --> 00:18:29,142
...see my life through your eyes...

132
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:32,219
...as your life will be seen through mine.

133
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:37,954
The son becomes the father,
and the father...

134
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,361
...the son.

135
00:18:44,201 --> 00:18:45,532
This is all l...

136
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:52,270
...all I can send you, Kal-El.

137
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:14,129
...which Einstein called his theory
of relativity.

138
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,007
Embedded in the crystals before you...

139
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:20,840
...is the total accumulation of all literature
and scientific fact...

140
00:23:21,078 --> 00:23:22,943
...from dozens of other worlds...

141
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:25,311
...spanning the 28 known galaxies.

142
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,029
Early Chinese writings point out
the complex relationship between....

143
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,643
By carrying this complex equation
to its ultimate power, my son....

144
00:24:01,051 --> 00:24:03,349
Chief among these powers
will be your sight...

145
00:24:03,454 --> 00:24:05,581
...your strength, your hearing...

146
00:24:05,856 --> 00:24:09,121
...your ability to propel yourself
at almost limitless speed.

147
00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:15,121
The early history of our universe was
a bloody mosaic of interplanetary war.

148
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:18,428
Each of the six galaxies
which you will pass through...

149
00:24:18,736 --> 00:24:21,500
...contain their own individual law
of space and time.

150
00:24:21,572 --> 00:24:24,837
It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.

151
00:24:58,175 --> 00:24:59,665
-What!
-What was that?

152
00:25:24,468 --> 00:25:27,028
Now wouldn't that beat all get out.
Well, you....

153
00:25:37,014 --> 00:25:38,038
Oh, pa !

154
00:25:39,016 --> 00:25:39,846
Oh, my.

155
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,643
All these years, as happy as we’ve been...

156
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:19,382
...how I've prayed the good Lord
would see fit to give us a child.

157
00:26:21,758 --> 00:26:24,124
Honey, will you hand me that rag up there.

158
00:26:24,528 --> 00:26:26,018
You take things easy now.

159
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:28,724
Remember what Doc Frye said
about that heart of yours.

160
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:37,904
Now the first thing we’ve got to do
when we get home is find out...

161
00:26:38,675 --> 00:26:40,540
...who that boy’s proper family is.

162
00:26:41,845 --> 00:26:44,313
He hasn’t got any.
Not around here, anyway.

163
00:26:48,785 --> 00:26:51,185
Are you thinking
what I think you are thinking?

164
00:26:52,456 --> 00:26:56,085
We could say he’s the child of my cousin
in North Dakota...

165
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,350
...and just now orphaned.

166
00:27:00,998 --> 00:27:03,057
Jonathan, he’s only a baby.

167
00:27:03,267 --> 00:27:06,896
Martha, now you saw how we found him.

168
00:27:10,274 --> 00:27:13,072
Martha Clark Kent,
are you listening to what l’m saying?

169
00:27:46,443 --> 00:27:47,535
Come on, gang.

170
00:27:50,948 --> 00:27:52,813
That was a great game.

171
00:27:54,051 --> 00:27:55,040
All right.

172
00:27:57,254 --> 00:28:00,018
Come on, hustle. Let’s go.
Stack your helmets neatly.

173
00:28:00,657 --> 00:28:03,751
Remember about those uniforms,
cleaned and washed by tomorrow...

174
00:28:03,827 --> 00:28:05,727
...and looking like a football team.

175
00:28:05,963 --> 00:28:09,296
Clark, let’s have those clothes washed
and ready for tomorrow’s game.

176
00:28:09,366 --> 00:28:10,993
Got to beat Mount Vernon High.

177
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:12,866
Can you give me a lift?

178
00:28:19,643 --> 00:28:20,507
Lana?

179
00:28:20,711 --> 00:28:24,511
Don't bother with these.
I’ll take them in with the other equipment.

180
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:28,044
-Thank you, Clark.
-Sure.

181
00:28:29,186 --> 00:28:32,155
Listen, a whole bunch of us are going up
to Mary Ellen’s.

182
00:28:32,356 --> 00:28:35,655
play some records.
Would you like to come?

183
00:28:37,761 --> 00:28:38,591
Sure.

184
00:28:38,729 --> 00:28:40,720
Sounds like it could be a lot of fun.

185
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:43,362
Kent can’t make it.
Still got a lot of work to do.

186
00:28:44,134 --> 00:28:46,864
What are you talking about?
I've just finished stacking....

187
00:28:47,037 --> 00:28:48,026
All that?

188
00:28:49,006 --> 00:28:50,166
Oh, Brad!

189
00:28:51,308 --> 00:28:52,741
Hey, come on, Lana.

190
00:28:55,045 --> 00:28:55,977
Let’s go.

191
00:28:57,514 --> 00:28:58,947
-He has to clean up.
-’Bye, Clark.

192
00:28:59,182 --> 00:29:01,207
-’Bye, Lana.
-Clean this up, Clark.

193
00:29:03,954 --> 00:29:05,046
’Bye, Clark.

194
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:12,388
’Bye, Clark.

195
00:29:13,063 --> 00:29:15,031
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

196
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:28,736
Mommy, I saw a boy out there
run as fast as the train!

197
00:30:28,905 --> 00:30:30,304
Faster even!

198
00:30:31,108 --> 00:30:34,669
Lois Lane,
you have a writer’s gift for invention.

199
00:30:34,745 --> 00:30:36,736
-I’ll say that for you.
-But--

200
00:30:37,047 --> 00:30:39,208
Lois, please read your book.

201
00:30:40,283 --> 00:30:41,682
No one ever believes me.

202
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,615
Hey, look, there’s Clark!

203
00:31:18,655 --> 00:31:19,644
Clark?

204
00:31:20,724 --> 00:31:22,316
How did you get here so fast?

205
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,392
I ran.

206
00:31:24,661 --> 00:31:25,889
Ran, huh?

207
00:31:26,096 --> 00:31:29,065
Told you he was an oddball.
Let’s get out of here.

208
00:31:36,139 --> 00:31:38,300
Been showing off a bit, haven’t you, Son?

209
00:31:51,288 --> 00:31:53,051
I didn’t mean to show off, pa.

210
00:31:56,827 --> 00:32:00,490
It’s just that guys like that Brad,
I just want to tear them apart.

211
00:32:00,564 --> 00:32:01,588
Yeah, I know.

212
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:04,066
Yeah, I know I shouldn’t.

213
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:06,965
Yeah, I know you can do
all these amazing things...

214
00:32:07,037 --> 00:32:09,835
...and sometimes you think
that you will just go bust...

215
00:32:09,906 --> 00:32:11,874
...unless you can tell people about it.

216
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:13,204
-Yeah.
-That’s right.

217
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,279
I mean, every time I get the football
I can make a touchdown.

218
00:32:16,379 --> 00:32:18,176
-That’s for sure.
-Every time.

219
00:32:18,515 --> 00:32:22,042
Is it showing off when somebody’s doing
the things he’s capable of doing?

220
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:24,153
Is a bird showing off when it flies?

221
00:32:24,321 --> 00:32:26,949
No, no. Now, you listen to me.

222
00:32:27,691 --> 00:32:31,491
When you came to us, we thought
people would take you away...

223
00:32:32,162 --> 00:32:34,528
...when they found out
the things that you do.

224
00:32:34,764 --> 00:32:36,595
It worried us a lot.

225
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:39,997
Then when a man gets older
and he thinks very differently.

226
00:32:40,537 --> 00:32:42,027
And things get very clear.

227
00:32:42,739 --> 00:32:47,472
And there’s one thing I do know, Son,
and that is you are here for a reason.

228
00:32:48,211 --> 00:32:50,873
I don’t know whose reason,
or whatever the reason is...

229
00:32:50,947 --> 00:32:52,505
...maybe it’s because....

230
00:32:56,653 --> 00:32:57,779
I don’t know.

231
00:33:00,123 --> 00:33:03,718
But I do know one thing.
It’s not to score touchdowns.

232
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,322
Thanks, Dad.

233
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,695
I’ll race you to it. Yeah.

234
00:33:11,968 --> 00:33:12,900
You will?

235
00:33:13,236 --> 00:33:15,204
Come on, papa. Run. Come on. Move.

236
00:33:15,438 --> 00:33:18,236
Go, go. Come on. Hey, Baron.

237
00:33:49,706 --> 00:33:51,173
Jonathan!

238
00:33:57,514 --> 00:33:58,503
Dad.

239
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:51,657
All those things I can do...

240
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,504
...all those powers...

241
00:34:57,907 --> 00:34:59,932
...and I couldn’t even save him.

242
00:37:59,923 --> 00:38:01,891
Clark, get up.

243
00:38:06,362 --> 00:38:08,159
Good morning, Smiley.

244
00:38:09,499 --> 00:38:11,592
Clark, breakfast.

245
00:38:15,405 --> 00:38:17,600
Are you going to sleep all day?

246
00:38:19,442 --> 00:38:21,706
Clark, come on. Get up.

247
00:39:22,772 --> 00:39:24,000
I have to leave.

248
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,439
I knew this time would come.

249
00:39:33,683 --> 00:39:36,413
We both knew it
from the day we found you.

250
00:39:48,364 --> 00:39:50,389
I talked to Ben Hubbard yesterday.

251
00:39:52,402 --> 00:39:56,566
He said that he’d be happy
to help out from now on.

252
00:40:05,581 --> 00:40:06,605
Mother!

253
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:09,443
I know, Son.

254
00:40:12,055 --> 00:40:13,044
I know.

255
00:40:17,427 --> 00:40:20,225
Do you know where you’re headed?

256
00:40:24,834 --> 00:40:25,823
North.

257
00:40:31,741 --> 00:40:33,003
Remember us, Son.

258
00:40:35,411 --> 00:40:36,844
Always remember us.

259
00:46:13,816 --> 00:46:14,942
My son...

260
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:24,020
...you do not remember me.

261
00:46:25,628 --> 00:46:26,754
I am Jor-El.

262
00:46:28,531 --> 00:46:29,828
I am your father.

263
00:46:32,335 --> 00:46:34,963
By now you will have reached
your eighteenth year...

264
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:37,298
...as it is measured on Earth.

265
00:46:38,507 --> 00:46:39,997
By that reckoning...

266
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:44,136
...l will have been dead
for many thousands of your years.

267
00:46:46,716 --> 00:46:47,944
The knowledge...

268
00:46:49,218 --> 00:46:52,381
...that I have of matters,
physicalandhistorical...

269
00:46:52,888 --> 00:46:56,085
...I have given you fully on your voyage
to your new home.

270
00:46:57,326 --> 00:46:59,487
These are important matters to be sure...

271
00:47:00,363 --> 00:47:02,558
...but still matters of mere fact.

272
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,131
There are questions to be asked...

273
00:47:07,236 --> 00:47:09,864
...andit is time for you to do so.

274
00:47:12,842 --> 00:47:14,036
Here, in this...

275
00:47:15,511 --> 00:47:18,036
...this fortress ofsolitude...

276
00:47:19,782 --> 00:47:22,046
...we shall try to find the answers together.

277
00:47:24,153 --> 00:47:25,313
So, my son...

278
00:47:26,756 --> 00:47:27,586
...speak.

279
00:47:29,592 --> 00:47:30,388
Who am l?

280
00:47:31,794 --> 00:47:33,091
Your name is Kal-El.

281
00:47:34,764 --> 00:47:37,858
You are the only survivor
of the Planet Krypton.

282
00:47:38,834 --> 00:47:42,793
Even though you were raised
as a human, you are not one of them.

283
00:47:44,073 --> 00:47:47,804
You have great powers,
only some of which you have...

284
00:47:48,444 --> 00:47:49,843
...as yet discovered.

285
00:47:52,815 --> 00:47:54,407
Come with me now, my son...

286
00:47:54,483 --> 00:47:57,452
...as we break through the bars
of your earthly confinement.

287
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,647
Traveling through time and space.

288
00:48:01,257 --> 00:48:04,988
Your powers will far exceed
those of mortal men.

289
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,824
It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.

290
00:48:07,963 --> 00:48:11,126
Rather, let your leadership stir others to.

291
00:48:13,068 --> 00:48:16,970
In the next year,
we shall examine the human heart.

292
00:48:18,107 --> 00:48:20,166
It is more fragile than your own.

293
00:48:22,411 --> 00:48:26,370
As we pass through the flaming turmoil
which is the edge of your own galaxy...

294
00:48:27,082 --> 00:48:29,607
...we will enter the realm
of the red Krypton sun...

295
00:48:29,685 --> 00:48:32,017
...source of your strength
andnourishment...

296
00:48:32,221 --> 00:48:34,621
...and cause of our eventual destruction.

297
00:48:36,091 --> 00:48:38,582
The Planet Krypton, my son...

298
00:48:39,462 --> 00:48:41,657
...your home as it was.

299
00:48:43,766 --> 00:48:47,566
This year we shall examine
the various concepts of immortality...

300
00:48:48,003 --> 00:48:49,971
...and their basis in actual fact.

301
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:55,270
The total accumulation of all knowledge
spanning the 28 known galaxies...

302
00:48:55,778 --> 00:48:58,941
...is embedded in the crystals
which I have sent along with you.

303
00:48:59,348 --> 00:49:00,975
Study them well, my son.

304
00:49:04,587 --> 00:49:07,681
By the time you return to the confines
of your galaxy...

305
00:49:08,157 --> 00:49:10,352
...twelve of your years will have passed.

306
00:49:10,993 --> 00:49:12,756
For this reason, among others...

307
00:49:13,896 --> 00:49:15,864
...I have chosen Earth for you.

308
00:49:16,131 --> 00:49:18,929
It is now time for you to rejoin
your new world...

309
00:49:19,802 --> 00:49:22,100
...and to serve its collective humanity.

310
00:49:23,572 --> 00:49:25,563
Live as one of them, Kal-El...

311
00:49:26,408 --> 00:49:29,400
...and discover where your strength
and your power are needed.

312
00:49:29,879 --> 00:49:34,509
But always hold in your heart the pride
of your special heritage.

313
00:49:35,885 --> 00:49:38,581
They can be a great people, Kal-El,
they wish to be.

314
00:49:39,655 --> 00:49:41,953
They only lack the light to show the way.

315
00:49:43,926 --> 00:49:47,054
For this reason, above all,
their capacity for good...

316
00:49:48,564 --> 00:49:50,054
...I have sent them you...

317
00:49:52,401 --> 00:49:53,493
...my only son.

318
00:50:29,872 --> 00:50:32,500
Okay, this is it, mac, the Daily Planet.

319
00:50:33,042 --> 00:50:36,842
Fresh fruit!
Hey, how about a tomato, lady?

320
00:50:37,446 --> 00:50:39,607
Hey, fresh fruit and vegetables.

321
00:51:12,014 --> 00:51:12,946
Smile.

322
00:51:15,451 --> 00:51:17,214
How many "T’s" in "bloodletting"?

323
00:51:17,319 --> 00:51:18,217
Two.

324
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,091
What are you writing?

325
00:51:26,195 --> 00:51:28,459
An ode to spring.
How do you spell "massacre"?

326
00:51:29,498 --> 00:51:33,935
M-a-s-s-a-c-r-e.

327
00:51:34,603 --> 00:51:35,627
Thanks.

328
00:51:35,871 --> 00:51:38,396
Golly, how come you get
all the great stories?

329
00:51:38,474 --> 00:51:40,635
A good reporter doesn’t get great stories.

330
00:51:40,709 --> 00:51:42,176
A good reporter makes them great.

331
00:51:42,244 --> 00:51:44,337
Chief, here’s that story on the murder case.

332
00:51:44,413 --> 00:51:47,746
The way I see it, it’s a headline
on the front page with my picture--

333
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:51,377
There’s only one "p" in "rapist."
Lois Lane, say hello to Clark Kent.

334
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,310
Hello, Miss Lane, how are--

335
00:51:57,726 --> 00:51:59,887
How are you doing?
Jimmy Olsen, photographer.

336
00:51:59,962 --> 00:52:01,793
Hi. Clark Kent. Nice to meet you.

337
00:52:03,365 --> 00:52:05,959
It’s got everything:
sex, violence, the ethnic angle.

338
00:52:06,235 --> 00:52:08,635
So does a lady wrestler
with a foreign accent.

339
00:52:08,704 --> 00:52:10,865
-Kent, can you open this?
-Sure, Mr. White.

340
00:52:10,939 --> 00:52:13,203
This could be the basis
for a series of articles:

341
00:52:13,275 --> 00:52:16,039
"Making Sense of Senseless Killings"
by Lois Lane.

342
00:52:16,345 --> 00:52:18,973
We get psychologists,
sociologists, interviews....

343
00:52:19,048 --> 00:52:22,506
Lois, you’re pushing a bunch
of rinky-dink tabloid garbage.

344
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:24,876
The Daily Planet has a tradition....

345
00:52:24,953 --> 00:52:26,420
Oh, l’m sorry, l’m sorry.

346
00:52:26,855 --> 00:52:29,323
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean
to shake it up like that.

347
00:52:29,925 --> 00:52:31,222
Of course not, Lois.

348
00:52:31,827 --> 00:52:34,955
Why would any one want to make
a total stranger look like a fool?

349
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:38,257
I’ll take that.

350
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:40,198
Thanks. I’m sorry, Mr. White.

351
00:52:40,269 --> 00:52:43,830
Why do I pay you $40 a week when
I should have you arrested for loitering?

352
00:52:43,906 --> 00:52:45,430
-Go get Mr...a towel.
-Kent.

353
00:52:45,507 --> 00:52:46,997
-Move, kid, move.
-Right, Chief.

354
00:52:47,076 --> 00:52:49,135
-Make mine black, no sugar.
-Right, Chief.

355
00:52:49,211 --> 00:52:50,678
And don’t call me sugar.

356
00:52:52,014 --> 00:52:53,743
Right.... Sugar.

357
00:52:53,949 --> 00:52:56,611
Chief wants coffee, no sugar.
I’ll take tea with lemon.

358
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:01,153
Lois, why don’t you take Kent out
to meet everybody, huh?

359
00:53:01,223 --> 00:53:04,124
Just introduce him around.
He’s starting on the paper today.

360
00:53:04,326 --> 00:53:05,918
I’m giving him the City beat.

361
00:53:06,695 --> 00:53:07,491
Chief!

362
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:09,697
That’s my beat!

363
00:53:10,099 --> 00:53:13,728
Lois, Clark Kent may seem like
just a mild-mannered reporter...

364
00:53:13,936 --> 00:53:17,997
...but not only does he know how to treat
his Chief with the proper respect...

365
00:53:18,073 --> 00:53:20,803
...not only does he have a snappy,
punchy prose style...

366
00:53:20,876 --> 00:53:24,869
...but he is, in my 40 years in this business,
the fastest typist I have ever seen.

367
00:53:24,947 --> 00:53:25,936
That’s great.

368
00:53:26,715 --> 00:53:28,444
Here, you forgot my article.

369
00:53:32,154 --> 00:53:34,418
Excuse me, Mr. White. I was wondering...

370
00:53:34,523 --> 00:53:36,923
...if you could arrange for half my salary...

371
00:53:37,126 --> 00:53:39,526
...to be sent to this address
on a weekly basis.

372
00:53:39,995 --> 00:53:40,825
Your bookie, right?

373
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:41,691
My what?

374
00:53:41,797 --> 00:53:42,786
Don't tell me!

375
00:53:42,865 --> 00:53:45,800
He sends a check every week
to his sweet, gray-haired mother.

376
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:47,595
Actually, she’s silver-haired.

377
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:51,305
I’ll see what I can do.

378
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,837
Thank you very much, Mr. White.

379
00:53:58,313 --> 00:53:59,007
Well?

380
00:54:01,016 --> 00:54:02,483
Any more at home like you?

381
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:04,411
Not really, no.

382
00:54:07,556 --> 00:54:08,853
I didn’t think so.

383
00:54:10,459 --> 00:54:12,757
Well, get yourself a desk over here.

384
00:54:13,529 --> 00:54:14,518
Over here?

385
00:54:14,596 --> 00:54:17,360
Here, there’s some paper
and a file right there.

386
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:18,465
Sorry.

387
00:54:35,417 --> 00:54:38,181
-Hi, Bill Breesen.
-Hi, Clark Kent.

388
00:54:38,253 --> 00:54:40,585
-Nice to meet you.
-Welcome aboard.

389
00:54:41,423 --> 00:54:44,586
-Here’s your towel, Mr. Clark.
-Kent.

390
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:45,684
-What?
-Kent.

391
00:54:46,762 --> 00:54:48,662
-Clark Kent.
-Jimmy Olsen.

392
00:54:54,937 --> 00:54:57,906
-I met this really great guy, you know.
-Hey, fabulous.

393
00:54:57,973 --> 00:55:01,409
We had this fabulous weekend.
I met him at this dude ranch.

394
00:55:01,476 --> 00:55:03,103
I haven’t been since I was seven.

395
00:55:03,178 --> 00:55:06,045
-I got to mail these letters.
-Good luck tonight.

396
00:55:06,114 --> 00:55:07,604
-Hi, Clark.
-Hi, Lois.

397
00:55:07,683 --> 00:55:10,117
How did you like your first day on the job?

398
00:55:10,853 --> 00:55:13,413
The hours were sort of longer
than I expected...

399
00:55:13,488 --> 00:55:16,753
...but on the whole, meeting you
and Jimmy Olsen and Mr. White....

400
00:55:16,825 --> 00:55:18,986
Gosh, on a whole, l’d say it’s been swell.

401
00:55:19,061 --> 00:55:20,426
-"Swell"?
-Yup.

402
00:55:22,364 --> 00:55:23,524
You know, Clark...

403
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,334
...there are very few people left
in the world...

404
00:55:27,402 --> 00:55:29,461
...who feel comfortable saying that word.

405
00:55:29,538 --> 00:55:30,800
-What word?
-Swell.

406
00:55:30,873 --> 00:55:33,398
Really? I always thought
it was kind of natural.

407
00:55:35,644 --> 00:55:37,339
-Sorry.
-Clark.

408
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:42,641
-Sorry, Lois.
-Hi, Rex.

409
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:45,918
-Did you see anything good today?
-Not until you came along.

410
00:55:46,188 --> 00:55:47,280
Rex, this is....

411
00:55:47,356 --> 00:55:49,324
-Clark Kent. How do--
-See you around.

412
00:55:51,593 --> 00:55:52,457
Lois?

413
00:55:53,495 --> 00:55:54,826
Hey, where you going?

414
00:55:54,897 --> 00:55:56,296
Can I help you with your coat?

415
00:55:56,365 --> 00:55:58,162
-Thanks. Can you get that?
-Sure.

416
00:55:58,233 --> 00:55:59,632
Did you like Mr. White?

417
00:55:59,701 --> 00:56:01,965
He was a nice guy
and Jimmy was fantastic.

418
00:56:02,804 --> 00:56:04,567
Come here. Come on.

419
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,232
Get in here, hurry up. Come on.

420
00:56:06,308 --> 00:56:09,539
-We’d better get out of here.
-We’d better do what he says, Lois.

421
00:56:09,811 --> 00:56:11,335
Come on, get in here, quick.

422
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:14,314
Don't, don’t do anything.
It’s all right, l’m coming.

423
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:15,678
We’re coming.

424
00:56:15,851 --> 00:56:16,875
Excuse me.

425
00:56:17,252 --> 00:56:18,344
-Here?
-Yeah, yeah.

426
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:21,446
Don't point that at me, sir.
You could hurt somebody with that.

427
00:56:22,758 --> 00:56:24,350
Okay, okay. Hold it there.

428
00:56:24,593 --> 00:56:25,582
Just a minute.

429
00:56:25,861 --> 00:56:27,123
Now I realize that...

430
00:56:27,195 --> 00:56:30,494
...times are tough for some these days,
but this isn’t the answer.

431
00:56:30,565 --> 00:56:33,932
You can’t solve society’s problems
with a gun.

432
00:56:35,003 --> 00:56:36,595
You know, buddy, you’re right.

433
00:56:36,939 --> 00:56:40,534
-I’m going to turn over a new leaf.
-Good for you, sir. That’s the spirit.

434
00:56:40,642 --> 00:56:42,667
He doesn’t really want to hurt anyone.

435
00:56:43,545 --> 00:56:45,672
Right after I rip off this lady’s purse.

436
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:46,611
Of course!

437
00:56:47,015 --> 00:56:48,710
Now come on, lady, hand it over.

438
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,085
Lois, I think you’d better....

439
00:56:55,557 --> 00:56:57,149
Lois! What are you doing?

440
00:57:15,544 --> 00:57:16,943
Are you all right?

441
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,038
What happened?

442
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:23,179
-Golly, I guess I must have fainted.
-Fainted?

443
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,082
-You fainted!
-I’m sorry.

444
00:57:40,035 --> 00:57:42,503
Really, Lois,
supposing that man had shot you?

445
00:57:42,571 --> 00:57:44,630
Is it worth risking your life over $10...

446
00:57:44,706 --> 00:57:47,072
...two credit cards,
a hairbrush and a lipstick?

447
00:57:47,909 --> 00:57:49,706
-How did you know that?
-Know what?

448
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,812
You described the exact contents
of my purse.

449
00:57:58,186 --> 00:57:59,084
Wild guess.

450
00:58:03,025 --> 00:58:03,821
Taxi!

451
00:58:08,764 --> 00:58:10,129
-Hey!
-Hi, Otis.

452
00:58:21,543 --> 00:58:23,204
So, what’s happening, partner?

453
00:58:23,412 --> 00:58:24,606
Look what we got.

454
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,238
Let’s take him.

455
00:58:26,448 --> 00:58:27,915
Wait a minute.

456
00:58:27,983 --> 00:58:30,247
Maybe he’ll lead us to the big man himself.

457
00:58:30,619 --> 00:58:31,608
Lex Luthor?

458
00:58:31,987 --> 00:58:33,249
You got it, Aramus.

459
00:58:34,523 --> 00:58:36,320
We’ll make Captain by midnight.

460
00:58:38,393 --> 00:58:42,159
Hey, what do you read?
XK-101 rocket to be used.

461
00:58:43,065 --> 00:58:44,532
Hey, what do you read?

462
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,629
-Hey, Matt.
-Hi, Otis.

463
00:58:46,701 --> 00:58:48,601
Just getting a Daily Planet here.

464
00:58:54,643 --> 00:58:56,076
Okay. All right.

465
00:58:56,611 --> 00:58:58,943
See, l’m paying him,
and I got a pretzel, too.

466
00:58:59,014 --> 00:59:00,106
Thanks, Otis.

467
00:59:00,949 --> 00:59:02,246
How many bags, Shutzy?

468
00:59:05,253 --> 00:59:07,813
This is Metropolis 46. We’re on foot.
Over and out.

469
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:09,022
Let’s go.

470
00:59:14,096 --> 00:59:16,428
Your attention, please.

471
00:59:16,498 --> 00:59:18,295
Your attention, please.

472
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,665
The Metropolis Flyer is now ready
for departure...

473
00:59:22,037 --> 00:59:24,699
...on the upper level. Track 6.

474
00:59:26,575 --> 00:59:29,738
He’s going down on a train platform.
I’m going after him.

475
00:59:29,811 --> 00:59:32,439
Okay, l’ll call for backup.
Be careful now, will you?

476
00:59:32,514 --> 00:59:34,209
All right, Aramus. All right.

477
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:38,548
Now boarding on the lower level....

478
00:59:39,087 --> 00:59:43,820
Now 10 minutes, air-conditioned cars,
Mount Vernon, poughkeepsie....

479
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:45,683
Board now. All aboard.

480
00:59:45,994 --> 00:59:49,521
Metropolis Transportation
to Buffalo, Syracuse....

481
00:59:50,565 --> 00:59:53,125
Smoking cars are forward,
move along now.

482
00:59:53,735 --> 00:59:54,997
Luggage at the top.

483
00:59:55,504 --> 00:59:58,496
Smoking cars are forward.
All aboard, boarding.

484
01:00:26,434 --> 01:00:28,834
Aramus, Aramus, make it Track 22.

485
01:00:29,271 --> 01:00:32,536
I’ve seen him and l’m right on him.
Lower level, Track 22.

486
01:01:09,644 --> 01:01:10,906
So that’s it!

487
01:01:27,128 --> 01:01:30,825
It’s amazing that brain can generate
enough power to keep those legs moving.

488
01:02:12,974 --> 01:02:13,770
Harry....

489
01:02:16,378 --> 01:02:18,539
Harry, where are you? Harry?

490
01:02:38,933 --> 01:02:39,661
Sick!

491
01:02:48,877 --> 01:02:50,504
Sick, you’re really sick!

492
01:02:51,379 --> 01:02:52,937
I’m sick, Ms. Teschmacher?

493
01:02:53,081 --> 01:02:56,107
Sick when we’re days
from executing the crime of the century?

494
01:02:56,685 --> 01:02:58,983
No, no, no. Step away from that, please.

495
01:03:00,588 --> 01:03:04,217
How do you choose to congratulate
the greatest criminal mind of our time?

496
01:03:04,726 --> 01:03:06,523
Do you tell me that l’m brilliant?

497
01:03:06,594 --> 01:03:09,620
Oh, no, that would be too obvious,
I grant you.

498
01:03:09,864 --> 01:03:10,831
Charismatic?

499
01:03:11,433 --> 01:03:12,730
Fiendishly gifted?

500
01:03:13,935 --> 01:03:15,402
Try twisted!

501
01:03:21,209 --> 01:03:23,302
Get away from that, get away!

502
01:03:25,413 --> 01:03:26,880
Tell me, Lex.

503
01:03:27,048 --> 01:03:30,074
Why do so many people have to die
for the crime of the century?

504
01:03:30,151 --> 01:03:31,448
Why? You ask why?

505
01:03:32,087 --> 01:03:34,920
Why does the phone always ring
when you’re in the bathtub?

506
01:03:36,391 --> 01:03:39,690
Why is the most brilliantly diabolical leader
of our time...

507
01:03:40,395 --> 01:03:42,693
...surrounding himself
with total nincompoops?

508
01:03:42,764 --> 01:03:44,061
I’m back, Mr. Luthor.

509
01:03:44,766 --> 01:03:46,734
I was just talking about you.

510
01:03:47,769 --> 01:03:49,236
You were followed again.

511
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:55,642
In spite of those cat-like reflexes.

512
01:04:00,615 --> 01:04:02,412
Mr. Luthor, l’m sorry.

513
01:04:05,053 --> 01:04:06,987
Is that the newspaper
I asked you to get me?

514
01:04:08,056 --> 01:04:08,988
Yes.

515
01:04:09,924 --> 01:04:11,551
Then why am I not reading it?

516
01:04:13,461 --> 01:04:15,429
Because I haven’t given it to you yet?

517
01:04:15,764 --> 01:04:16,560
Right.

518
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:23,067
At last it’s official.

519
01:04:24,139 --> 01:04:26,300
Thanks to the help of the US Government...

520
01:04:26,374 --> 01:04:30,174
...we are about to be involved in
the greatest real estate swindle of all time.

521
01:04:30,512 --> 01:04:31,809
Lex, what is this...

522
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:35,008
...obsession with real estate?
All the time, "land, land, land."

523
01:04:35,316 --> 01:04:38,183
When I was 6 years old,
my father said to me--

524
01:04:38,353 --> 01:04:39,183
"Get out!"

525
01:04:40,989 --> 01:04:44,618
Before that, he said,
"Son, stocks may rise and fall...

526
01:04:44,692 --> 01:04:47,525
"...utilities and transportation systems
may collapse...

527
01:04:47,595 --> 01:04:50,689
"...people are no damn good,
but they’ll always need land...

528
01:04:50,765 --> 01:04:53,097
"...they’ll pay through the nose to get it."

529
01:04:53,168 --> 01:04:55,398
-"Remember," my father said--
-"Land."

530
01:04:58,706 --> 01:05:01,072
It’s a pity that he didn’t see...

531
01:05:01,142 --> 01:05:04,077
...from such humble beginnings
how I've created this empire.

532
01:05:04,145 --> 01:05:05,442
An empire. This?

533
01:05:06,714 --> 01:05:11,344
How many girls do you know
have a park Avenue address like this?

534
01:05:12,053 --> 01:05:15,181
park Avenue address, 200 feet below?

535
01:05:15,523 --> 01:05:18,185
Do you realize
what people are shelling out up there...

536
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,054
...for a few miserable rooms
off a common elevator.

537
01:05:21,629 --> 01:05:23,563
What more could anyone ask?

538
01:05:31,673 --> 01:05:34,642
Get this Loch Ness update
right into composing.

539
01:05:35,043 --> 01:05:38,171
Yeah. No, that’s it, Roth.
Put it to bed. Right.

540
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:41,244
-Why are you standing here for?
-I’m not.

541
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:43,777
-I wasn’t going to say it.
-Go.

542
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:50,858
The sex maniac profile.

543
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:54,324
Right. Nine to five it’s
a Pulitzer Prize winner. What do you bet?

544
01:05:54,395 --> 01:05:56,022
There’s no "z" in "brassiere."

545
01:05:56,231 --> 01:05:58,529
Nice job on that union scandal, Kent.

546
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:00,232
Gosh, thanks, Mr. White.

547
01:06:05,006 --> 01:06:06,337
Hi, Clark. Good night.

548
01:06:06,407 --> 01:06:09,205
-Here, let me carry that for you.
-Thanks a lot.

549
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:11,378
Lois, have you got a minute?

550
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,006
Excuse me, please.

551
01:06:14,282 --> 01:06:17,649
And these two go to the addresses
on the envelope, okay?

552
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,784
I was wondering
if you’d have dinner with me?

553
01:06:20,855 --> 01:06:22,789
I’m sorry, l’m booked.

554
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:27,325
Air Force One is landing at the airport.
This kid’ll be there to make sure...

555
01:06:27,395 --> 01:06:30,455
...you-know-who answers the questions
he would rather duck.

556
01:06:30,532 --> 01:06:31,897
Don't you ever let up?

557
01:06:32,133 --> 01:06:35,034
What for? I mean I've seen
how the other half lives.

558
01:06:35,136 --> 01:06:38,970
My sister, for instance.
Three kids, two cats, and one mortgage.

559
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:41,372
I would go bananas in a week.

560
01:06:41,509 --> 01:06:44,307
-Can I take you to the airport?
-Not unless you can fly.

561
01:06:47,582 --> 01:06:50,346
"Ladies." I have to change, thank you.
Goodbye.

562
01:06:50,418 --> 01:06:51,612
Maybe we could--

563
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:02,161
-Would you mail that for me? Thanks.
-Sure.

564
01:07:02,397 --> 01:07:03,386
Good night.

565
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:11,402
Going down, please, going down.

566
01:07:14,776 --> 01:07:15,834
Going down?

567
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:17,275
Going up. Up, up.

568
01:07:19,247 --> 01:07:20,236
Good night.

569
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,521
Daily planet, Copter One. This is ground.

570
01:07:34,596 --> 01:07:35,961
Planet One, go ahead.

571
01:07:36,164 --> 01:07:40,533
Miss Lane is here for a ride to the airport
to meet Air Force One. It’s a hurry flight.

572
01:07:40,935 --> 01:07:44,996
We ’re on our way over the river.
Have one aboard for transfer. Over.

573
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:50,141
Roger, Planet One. You’re clear to land.
Wind 0-2-0-1-5. Altimeter 2-9-8-9.

574
01:07:50,511 --> 01:07:51,808
Roger, Over and out.

575
01:08:53,074 --> 01:08:54,666
A malfunction, can’t get lift off.

576
01:08:54,742 --> 01:08:57,210
-You’ve hooked a cable.
-What’s happening?

577
01:08:58,780 --> 01:08:59,804
Set it down.

578
01:08:59,881 --> 01:09:01,678
My God, we’ve lost motor control.

579
01:09:01,749 --> 01:09:02,841
I can’t hold it.

580
01:09:09,524 --> 01:09:10,616
I can’t hold it.

581
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:13,027
He’s lost it.

582
01:09:27,809 --> 01:09:28,707
Wake up.

583
01:09:31,879 --> 01:09:33,506
Help!

584
01:09:52,133 --> 01:09:53,430
Step back, folks.

585
01:09:54,168 --> 01:09:56,728
Get back. Move over
to the other side of the street.

586
01:09:59,707 --> 01:10:02,540
Bring the canvas here. Get it up there.

587
01:10:02,777 --> 01:10:04,335
There’s helicopter up there.

588
01:10:10,718 --> 01:10:11,776
Help me.

589
01:10:20,628 --> 01:10:22,994
All right, folks. Let’s move back.

590
01:10:23,965 --> 01:10:25,592
Let these firemen get in here.

591
01:10:28,436 --> 01:10:29,198
Help me!

592
01:10:35,476 --> 01:10:36,773
Hold it. Get back.

593
01:10:40,848 --> 01:10:42,839
Get off the street, folks.

594
01:10:57,365 --> 01:11:00,664
All right, get along there.
Get away from the side of the building.

595
01:11:03,404 --> 01:11:05,531
Hold these crowds back. Move.

596
01:11:08,075 --> 01:11:08,871
Help!

597
01:11:25,526 --> 01:11:26,493
Say, Jim....

598
01:11:27,161 --> 01:11:27,991
Excuse me.

599
01:11:28,062 --> 01:11:29,529
That’s a bad outfit.

600
01:11:31,232 --> 01:11:32,699
Okay, move these people.

601
01:11:42,543 --> 01:11:44,010
Oh, my God! Look up there.

602
01:11:46,013 --> 01:11:47,275
What the hell’s that?

603
01:11:49,417 --> 01:11:50,941
Easy, miss. I’ve got you.

604
01:11:51,052 --> 01:11:54,021
You’ve got me? Who’s got you?

605
01:11:55,790 --> 01:11:59,749
I can’t believe it, I just cannot believe it.
He got her.

606
01:12:44,572 --> 01:12:46,597
Gentlemen, this man needs help.

607
01:12:48,576 --> 01:12:51,602
I hope this little incident
hasn’t put you off flying, miss.

608
01:12:53,347 --> 01:12:56,783
Statistically speaking, of course,
it’s still the safest way to travel.

609
01:12:57,985 --> 01:12:58,781
Right.

610
01:12:59,854 --> 01:13:00,843
Wait!

611
01:13:05,526 --> 01:13:06,652
Who are you?

612
01:13:07,595 --> 01:13:08,562
A friend.

613
01:13:13,901 --> 01:13:14,890
’Bye.

614
01:14:28,409 --> 01:14:30,240
Something wrong with the elevator?

615
01:14:37,718 --> 01:14:38,650
Going down?

616
01:14:51,432 --> 01:14:52,330
Officer.

617
01:14:55,736 --> 01:14:58,068
Good evening, Officer Mooney.

618
01:14:58,806 --> 01:15:00,933
They say confession is good for the soul.

619
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:05,779
I’d listen to this man. Take him away.

620
01:15:51,826 --> 01:15:53,521
Come on, let’s get out of here.

621
01:16:04,071 --> 01:16:05,538
Move your ass! Come on!

622
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:07,967
Okay, let’s go. Let’s go.

623
01:16:08,676 --> 01:16:11,474
Drop your weapons. Drop your weapons.

624
01:16:11,712 --> 01:16:14,340
Bullshit! Come on, let’s get out of here.

625
01:16:14,548 --> 01:16:16,516
Okay, hold it. Hold it right there.

626
01:16:16,817 --> 01:16:18,182
Okay, freeze, you turkeys.

627
01:16:18,252 --> 01:16:20,379
-Don't shoot!
-Keep your cool. You got us.

628
01:16:45,112 --> 01:16:46,238
Bad vibrations?

629
01:16:46,914 --> 01:16:50,042
Sergeant, you don’t believe me.
I swear it, flying.

630
01:16:50,518 --> 01:16:53,043
With a big red cape
and bright red boots as well.

631
01:16:53,521 --> 01:16:57,821
Quick as a wink he was gone. He flew up
in the air again, he did, like a big blue bird.

632
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,059
-A big blue bird?
-You don’t believe me!

633
01:17:00,127 --> 01:17:01,526
With bright red boots?

634
01:17:01,762 --> 01:17:02,956
Take the night off.

635
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:05,658
Go back to Murphy’s bar
and continue what you started.

636
01:17:05,933 --> 01:17:08,868
I’ll be off in a few minutes
and l’ll meet you there.

637
01:17:20,014 --> 01:17:22,414
The first bottle’s on me.
Let me get my hat.

638
01:17:33,561 --> 01:17:35,791
Frisky, will you come down from there.

639
01:17:38,065 --> 01:17:39,532
Hi. I’ll get him.

640
01:17:44,572 --> 01:17:46,164
Come on, it’s all right.

641
01:17:47,775 --> 01:17:50,642
-Here you go, miss.
-Gee, thanks, mister.

642
01:17:53,247 --> 01:17:55,272
Goodbye, Frisky. So long now.

643
01:17:58,953 --> 01:17:59,749
’Bye.

644
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:05,918
Mommy, Mommy,
Frisky was stuck in the tree.

645
01:18:06,126 --> 01:18:08,924
Then this man swooped out of the sky
and gave him to me.

646
01:18:09,196 --> 01:18:11,960
Haven’t I told you to stop telling lies.

647
01:18:17,004 --> 01:18:20,963
Metropolis Airport, this is Air Force One.
Could we have the latest weather report?

648
01:18:21,175 --> 01:18:25,077
Metropolis currently ceiling 500,
overcast 700 broken...

649
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:29,409
... visibility one-half in showers.
Wind 2-4-0-2-5. Altimeter 9-0-9-8.

650
01:18:29,617 --> 01:18:30,413
Roger.

651
01:18:31,885 --> 01:18:33,785
Doesn’t look good. What do you think?

652
01:18:35,489 --> 01:18:38,856
-What the hell was that?
-You’ve lost power in number one.

653
01:18:38,959 --> 01:18:40,984
Lost power? We’ve lost the whole engine.

654
01:18:41,495 --> 01:18:43,588
-pressure’s going.
-Shut down number one.

655
01:18:43,664 --> 01:18:44,756
Bring up two and three.

656
01:18:44,832 --> 01:18:47,130
We haven’t got enough pressure
to keep going.

657
01:18:48,702 --> 01:18:52,001
Mayday, mayday. Metropolis tower.
Air Force One.

658
01:18:52,306 --> 01:18:55,275
We have lost port outboard engine
and part of wing.

659
01:18:55,542 --> 01:18:58,375
Request emergency landing.
What’s the position?

660
01:18:58,512 --> 01:19:00,673
Ten miles southwest of Metropolis Airport.

661
01:19:00,748 --> 01:19:02,306
Notify them the president’s on board.

662
01:19:02,383 --> 01:19:06,251
present position 10 miles, that’s 10 miles
southwest of Metropolis Airport.

663
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,756
Heading: 3-0-5, height: 6,000 feet.

664
01:19:29,343 --> 01:19:31,777
What the hell happened?
We got our engine back?

665
01:19:32,146 --> 01:19:34,080
What the hell’s going on out there?

666
01:19:34,281 --> 01:19:37,409
Fly, don’t look, just fly.

667
01:19:37,785 --> 01:19:39,309
We got something.

668
01:19:40,054 --> 01:19:43,319
I’m not saying what it is, just trust me.

669
01:19:55,871 --> 01:19:57,702
You enjoyed it.

670
01:20:01,476 --> 01:20:03,341
I don’t know what to say, Father.

671
01:20:03,645 --> 01:20:05,442
I am afraid just got carried away.

672
01:20:06,548 --> 01:20:09,312
-I anticipated this, my son.
-You couldn’t have.

673
01:20:10,519 --> 01:20:12,180
You couldn’t have imagined....

674
01:20:13,589 --> 01:20:14,851
How good it felt?

675
01:20:17,659 --> 01:20:19,320
You are revealed to the world.

676
01:20:21,496 --> 01:20:22,463
Very well.

677
01:20:23,298 --> 01:20:24,060
So be it.

678
01:20:25,467 --> 01:20:28,095
But you still must keep
your secret identity.

679
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:29,759
Why?

680
01:20:30,439 --> 01:20:31,701
The reasons are two.

681
01:20:32,641 --> 01:20:35,576
First.: You cannot serve humanity
28hours a day.

682
01:20:37,145 --> 01:20:38,703
24.

683
01:20:40,115 --> 01:20:41,514
As it is, it won’t happen.

684
01:20:43,418 --> 01:20:45,978
Your help will be called for endlessly.

685
01:20:46,054 --> 01:20:49,455
Even for those tasks that human beings
can solve themselves.

686
01:20:50,125 --> 01:20:53,561
They’re happy to abuse the resources
of the world.

687
01:20:54,096 --> 01:20:55,154
And secondly?

688
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:56,219
Secondly.:

689
01:20:56,632 --> 01:20:58,259
Your enemies will discover...

690
01:20:59,401 --> 01:21:01,164
...their only way to hurt you...

691
01:21:01,603 --> 01:21:03,594
...by hurting the people you care for.

692
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:06,232
Thank you, Father.

693
01:21:06,575 --> 01:21:07,564
Lastly.:

694
01:21:10,278 --> 01:21:12,803
Do not punish yourself
with your feelings of vanity.

695
01:21:13,548 --> 01:21:15,209
Simply learn to control them.

696
01:21:15,684 --> 01:21:18,551
It is an affliction common to all,
even on Krypton.

697
01:21:19,554 --> 01:21:22,887
Our destruction could have been avoided
but for the vanity ofsome...

698
01:21:22,958 --> 01:21:25,449
...who considered us indestructible.

699
01:21:26,428 --> 01:21:27,918
Were it not for vanity...

700
01:21:29,564 --> 01:21:31,259
...at this very moment...

701
01:21:35,604 --> 01:21:37,834
...l could embrace you in my arms...

702
01:21:42,511 --> 01:21:43,443
...my son.

703
01:22:14,643 --> 01:22:18,170
Reports are coming in
of a miraculous saving of Air Force One...

704
01:22:18,313 --> 01:22:20,747
...from almost certain destruction.

705
01:22:21,183 --> 01:22:25,313
Rescuing Miss Lois Lane, reporter
from the Daily planet, with one hand...

706
01:22:26,521 --> 01:22:28,785
...and a crashed helicopter with the other.

707
01:22:31,593 --> 01:22:33,185
That’ll be the day.

708
01:22:34,863 --> 01:22:37,024
That’ll be the day when a guy could fly.

709
01:22:37,866 --> 01:22:40,198
I don’t know. You would be surprised.

710
01:22:42,704 --> 01:22:44,365
Some sort of fantastic hoax.

711
01:22:45,073 --> 01:22:47,541
Your guess is as good as anybody’s.
True or false?

712
01:22:47,609 --> 01:22:49,702
Miracle or fraud? The answer--

713
01:22:49,845 --> 01:22:51,506
-Miss Teschmacher!
-Man or myth?

714
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:53,272
Turn it off.

715
01:23:02,691 --> 01:23:06,491
What’s the story on this guy?
Do you think it’s the genuine article?

716
01:23:06,628 --> 01:23:08,493
If he is, he’s not from this world.

717
01:23:09,197 --> 01:23:09,925
Why?

718
01:23:10,532 --> 01:23:14,298
If any human being was gonna perpetrate
such a hoax, it would have been me!

719
01:23:26,248 --> 01:23:27,044
My robe.

720
01:23:29,384 --> 01:23:31,011
Right away, Mr. Luthor.

721
01:23:32,287 --> 01:23:35,120
It all fits somehow,
this coming here to Metropolis...

722
01:23:36,525 --> 01:23:38,322
...and at this particular time.

723
01:23:42,264 --> 01:23:44,630
There’s a kind of cruel justice about it.

724
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:49,266
To commit the crime of the century, a man
wants to face the challenge of the century.

725
01:23:52,073 --> 01:23:56,635
Listen, maybe this guy that flies
is just sort of passing through.

726
01:23:57,078 --> 01:23:58,170
passing through?

727
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,513
Not on your life, Otis...

728
01:24:00,582 --> 01:24:02,948
...which I would gladly sacrifice
by the way...

729
01:24:03,618 --> 01:24:07,349
...for the opportunity of destroying
everything that he represents.

730
01:24:08,557 --> 01:24:13,358
And, Otis, by the way, next time
put my robe on after l’m out of the pool.

731
01:24:15,864 --> 01:24:16,694
Now look.

732
01:24:16,965 --> 01:24:18,262
The Post, "It Flies."

733
01:24:18,733 --> 01:24:20,860
The News, "Look, Ma, No Wires."

734
01:24:21,102 --> 01:24:23,229
The Times,
"Blue Bomb Buzzes Metropolis."

735
01:24:23,538 --> 01:24:26,837
The Planet. We’re sitting on top
of the story of the century here.

736
01:24:27,576 --> 01:24:29,771
I want the name
of this flying whatchamacallit...

737
01:24:29,845 --> 01:24:32,006
...to go with the Daily Planet
like bacon and eggs...

738
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:35,140
...franks and beans, death and taxes,
politics and corruption.

739
01:24:35,383 --> 01:24:36,611
I don’t think that he’d...

740
01:24:36,685 --> 01:24:39,279
...lend himself
to any cheap promotion schemes.

741
01:24:39,487 --> 01:24:40,977
Exactly how would you know that?

742
01:24:44,192 --> 01:24:45,819
Just first impression.

743
01:24:45,927 --> 01:24:48,589
Who’s talking cheap?
l’ll make him a partner if I have to.

744
01:24:48,663 --> 01:24:49,960
-Right?
-Right, Chief.

745
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,297
I want the real story.

746
01:24:53,668 --> 01:24:55,636
I want the inside dope on this guy.

747
01:24:56,238 --> 01:24:59,799
Has he got a family? Where does he live?
What does the "S" stand for?

748
01:24:59,875 --> 01:25:04,972
Tonight at 8:00. Your place.
Hopefully - A friend.

749
01:25:08,683 --> 01:25:10,947
Tony, who is he? Mike, what’s his name?

750
01:25:11,186 --> 01:25:13,677
What’s he got hidden under that cape?
Batteries?

751
01:25:13,755 --> 01:25:15,620
Why did he show up last night?

752
01:25:16,091 --> 01:25:17,615
Where does he come from?

753
01:25:17,759 --> 01:25:19,158
Does he have a girlfriend?

754
01:25:21,196 --> 01:25:23,096
What’s his favorite ball team, Kent?

755
01:25:23,164 --> 01:25:25,792
Now listen to me, I tell you,
boys and girls...

756
01:25:26,167 --> 01:25:28,226
...whichever one of you gets it out of him...

757
01:25:28,303 --> 01:25:31,830
...is going to wind up with the single,
most important interview since...

758
01:25:33,108 --> 01:25:34,507
...God talked to Moses!

759
01:25:38,113 --> 01:25:40,911
What are you standing around about for?
Move!

760
01:25:41,616 --> 01:25:43,015
Get on that story.

761
01:26:01,403 --> 01:26:04,804
"8:00," he said. Some friend!

762
01:26:06,508 --> 01:26:09,375
That’s the story of my life,
"Cinderella Bites The Dust! "

763
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:23,314
Good evening, Miss Lane.

764
01:26:28,163 --> 01:26:30,063
Did you have plans this evening?

765
01:26:31,399 --> 01:26:32,661
This old thing? No.

766
01:26:33,501 --> 01:26:35,059
-I could come back later.
-No!

767
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:36,368
Don't move.

768
01:26:40,075 --> 01:26:41,440
Sure you can move.

769
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:44,271
Just don’t fly away, all right?

770
01:26:45,347 --> 01:26:48,316
Sorry to drop in on you like this,
but I've been thinking.

771
01:26:48,616 --> 01:26:52,108
There must be some questions
people’d like to know the answers to.

772
01:26:52,187 --> 01:26:53,176
Yes.

773
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,621
You really shouldn’t smoke.

774
01:27:02,497 --> 01:27:04,397
Don't tell me. Lung cancer, right?

775
01:27:07,335 --> 01:27:08,927
Well, not yet, thank goodness.

776
01:27:12,474 --> 01:27:14,135
Would you like a glass of wine?

777
01:27:14,342 --> 01:27:16,333
No, thanks. I never drink when I fly.

778
01:27:17,879 --> 01:27:18,971
Nice place.

779
01:27:19,381 --> 01:27:20,609
Thank you.

780
01:27:21,049 --> 01:27:22,243
Thank you.

781
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:24,880
Shall we get started with the interview?

782
01:27:31,659 --> 01:27:34,389
Let’s start with your vital statistics.
Are you married?

783
01:27:36,164 --> 01:27:37,222
No, l’m not.

784
01:27:38,299 --> 01:27:39,857
Do you have a girlfriend?

785
01:27:39,968 --> 01:27:41,265
No, I don’t. But....

786
01:27:41,836 --> 01:27:44,168
If I did, you’d be the first to know about it.

787
01:27:50,645 --> 01:27:52,670
-How old are you?
-Over 21 .

788
01:27:53,815 --> 01:27:56,010
I get it. You don’t want anyone to know.

789
01:27:56,718 --> 01:27:59,118
And how big are you? How tall are you?

790
01:27:59,421 --> 01:28:00,513
About 6’ 4".

791
01:28:00,755 --> 01:28:03,849
6’4". And how much do you weigh?

792
01:28:04,025 --> 01:28:05,720
Around 225.

793
01:28:06,661 --> 01:28:08,526
225?

794
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:17,265
I assume then that...

795
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:22,437
...the rest of your bodily functions
are normal?

796
01:28:23,545 --> 01:28:24,637
I beg your pardon?

797
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,711
Well, putting it delicately...

798
01:28:32,253 --> 01:28:33,379
...do you...

799
01:28:36,524 --> 01:28:37,286
...eat?

800
01:28:38,326 --> 01:28:41,090
Yes, I do, when l’m hungry.

801
01:28:41,930 --> 01:28:44,455
You do. Of course, you do.

802
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,634
Well, then is it true...

803
01:28:48,403 --> 01:28:52,430
...that you can see through anything?

804
01:28:52,841 --> 01:28:54,570
Yes, I can, pretty much.

805
01:28:55,543 --> 01:28:58,706
And that you’re totally impervious to pain?

806
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,304
Well, so far.

807
01:29:02,117 --> 01:29:03,948
What color underwear am I wearing?

808
01:29:08,556 --> 01:29:09,818
Did I embarrass you?

809
01:29:10,024 --> 01:29:11,389
-No.
-I did.

810
01:29:11,793 --> 01:29:14,387
No, it’s just that
this planter must be made of lead.

811
01:29:15,597 --> 01:29:16,461
Yes, it is. So?

812
01:29:16,531 --> 01:29:20,092
I sort of have a problem
seeing through lead.

813
01:29:21,169 --> 01:29:22,397
That’s interesting.

814
01:29:23,271 --> 01:29:24,533
problems with lead.

815
01:29:25,974 --> 01:29:29,068
-Do you have a first name?
-Like Ralph, or something?

816
01:29:29,144 --> 01:29:30,577
-No, I mean like--
-pink.

817
01:29:32,113 --> 01:29:32,909
pink!

818
01:29:35,984 --> 01:29:38,009
Sorry. I didn’t mean to embarrass you.

819
01:29:39,521 --> 01:29:40,920
You didn’t embarrass me.

820
01:29:43,158 --> 01:29:45,319
What’s your background?
Where are you from?

821
01:29:46,961 --> 01:29:49,020
It’s kind of hard to explain, actually.

822
01:29:49,264 --> 01:29:52,427
You see, l’m from....
Well, from pretty far away.

823
01:29:52,901 --> 01:29:56,564
Another galaxy, as a matter of fact.
I come from a planet called Krypton.

824
01:29:57,839 --> 01:29:58,863
Krypton.

825
01:30:00,175 --> 01:30:03,474
Cripton! With a C-r-i....

826
01:30:04,846 --> 01:30:08,145
No, actually it’s Krypton,
with a K-R-Y-p-T-O-N.

827
01:30:11,953 --> 01:30:13,215
Do you like pink?

828
01:30:18,626 --> 01:30:20,116
I like pink very much.

829
01:30:24,999 --> 01:30:25,897
Why are you?

830
01:30:26,568 --> 01:30:27,398
Sorry?

831
01:30:28,002 --> 01:30:31,529
I mean, why are you here?
There must be a reason for you to be here.

832
01:30:31,906 --> 01:30:35,342
Yes, l’m here to fight for truth and justice
and the American way.

833
01:30:36,711 --> 01:30:39,441
You’ll end up fighting every official
in this country.

834
01:30:39,847 --> 01:30:41,314
You don’t really mean that.

835
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:43,774
-I don’t believe this.
-Lois?

836
01:30:45,053 --> 01:30:46,077
I never lie.

837
01:30:55,063 --> 01:30:57,054
How fast do you fly, by the way?

838
01:30:57,632 --> 01:31:01,124
I don’t know. I’ve never actually bothered
to time myself.

839
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:02,964
Say?

840
01:31:04,572 --> 01:31:05,903
Why don’t we find out?

841
01:31:06,641 --> 01:31:08,506
And how do you propose we do that?

842
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:12,373
-Take a ride with me.
-You mean I could fly?

843
01:31:12,447 --> 01:31:14,677
I’d be hand Iing the flying, if that’s okay.

844
01:31:14,949 --> 01:31:18,180
-This is utterly fantastic.
-Wait a minute. Where are you going?

845
01:31:18,586 --> 01:31:20,451
-Are you serious?
-Sure.

846
01:31:21,189 --> 01:31:22,520
Don't you want to go?

847
01:31:24,158 --> 01:31:25,386
You won’t need these.

848
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:29,055
-I need a sweater. It must be kind of....
-No, you’ll be warm enough.

849
01:31:35,737 --> 01:31:36,567
Ready?

850
01:31:36,938 --> 01:31:41,534
Clark said that you were just a figment
of somebody’s imagination.

851
01:31:42,710 --> 01:31:43,802
Like peter pan.

852
01:31:44,379 --> 01:31:46,870
Clark, who’s that? Your boyfriend?

853
01:31:47,148 --> 01:31:50,584
-Clark? No, he’s nothing.
-peter pan?

854
01:31:53,054 --> 01:31:56,421
peter pan flew with children, Lois.
In a fairy tale.

855
01:35:13,521 --> 01:35:14,954
Can you read my mind?

856
01:35:20,628 --> 01:35:22,823
Do you know what it is that you do to me?

857
01:35:26,234 --> 01:35:27,701
I don’t know who you are.

858
01:35:33,641 --> 01:35:35,836
Just a friend from another star.

859
01:35:40,281 --> 01:35:42,476
Here lam, like a kid out of school.

860
01:35:44,452 --> 01:35:46,044
Holding hands with a god.

861
01:35:48,122 --> 01:35:49,111
I’m a fool.

862
01:35:51,225 --> 01:35:52,419
Will you look at me?

863
01:35:53,127 --> 01:35:54,025
Quivering.

864
01:35:55,162 --> 01:35:56,993
Like a little girl shivering.

865
01:35:58,399 --> 01:36:00,299
You can see right through me.

866
01:36:05,606 --> 01:36:06,971
Can you read my mind?

867
01:36:10,978 --> 01:36:13,276
Can you picture the things l’m thinking of?

868
01:36:18,119 --> 01:36:19,916
Wondering why you are...

869
01:36:21,822 --> 01:36:24,416
...all the wonderful things you are.

870
01:36:27,361 --> 01:36:28,555
You can fly.

871
01:36:30,164 --> 01:36:31,688
You belong in the sky.

872
01:36:34,001 --> 01:36:34,968
You and I...

873
01:36:36,938 --> 01:36:38,633
...could belong to each other.

874
01:36:42,143 --> 01:36:43,576
If you need a friend...

875
01:36:47,181 --> 01:36:49,081
...l’m the one to fly to.

876
01:36:53,688 --> 01:36:55,485
If you need to be loved...

877
01:36:57,458 --> 01:36:58,482
...here lam.

878
01:37:00,328 --> 01:37:01,556
Read my mind.

879
01:37:23,918 --> 01:37:25,545
We forgot to time ourselves.

880
01:37:28,055 --> 01:37:29,283
Maybe next time.

881
01:37:38,833 --> 01:37:39,629
You okay?

882
01:37:43,838 --> 01:37:44,770
Good night.

883
01:37:46,173 --> 01:37:47,071
Good night.

884
01:37:52,847 --> 01:37:53,973
What a super man!

885
01:38:00,588 --> 01:38:01,850
Superman!

886
01:38:07,294 --> 01:38:08,318
Anybody home?

887
01:38:17,338 --> 01:38:19,203
-Hi. Can I come in?
-Oh, yeah.

888
01:38:21,642 --> 01:38:24,076
For goodness’ sake,
didn’t you hear me knocking?

889
01:38:24,845 --> 01:38:27,837
We did have a date tonight, remember?

890
01:38:31,619 --> 01:38:32,847
You haven’t been...?

891
01:38:34,622 --> 01:38:38,615
I should certainly hope not.
Well, let’s push off, shall we?

892
01:38:39,493 --> 01:38:42,087
I’d better get a coat. It might be cold out.

893
01:38:42,296 --> 01:38:46,562
I mean, I need a purse,
and I have to fix my hair...

894
01:38:47,501 --> 01:38:48,900
...put some blusher on.

895
01:39:07,521 --> 01:39:10,115
There’s something I have to tell you.
I’m really....

896
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:17,091
I was at first really nervous about tonight.

897
01:39:18,566 --> 01:39:22,502
But then I decided, darn it, I was going
to show you the time of your life.

898
01:39:22,703 --> 01:39:23,795
That’s Clark nice.

899
01:39:27,007 --> 01:39:29,669
We could go for a hamburger
or whatever you want to do.

900
01:39:36,784 --> 01:39:37,751
Now then...

901
01:39:39,453 --> 01:39:42,422
...given the exact location
of the galaxy that he mentions...

902
01:39:43,190 --> 01:39:46,216
...and the proximity
to our own solar system....

903
01:39:48,996 --> 01:39:51,624
It’s amazing. Amazing!

904
01:39:52,767 --> 01:39:53,893
Too good to be true.

905
01:39:53,968 --> 01:39:57,267
It’s too good to be true.
6’ 4", black hair, blue eyes...

906
01:39:57,338 --> 01:39:59,704
...doesn’t drink or smoke
and tells the truth.

907
01:40:00,074 --> 01:40:02,599
Some people can read War andPeace...

908
01:40:03,210 --> 01:40:05,337
...and think it was an adventure story.

909
01:40:05,846 --> 01:40:08,371
Others can read the ingredients
on a gum wrapper...

910
01:40:08,682 --> 01:40:10,843
...and unlock the secrets of the universe.

911
01:40:12,553 --> 01:40:16,182
Lex, what has chewing gum got to do
with the secrets of the universe?

912
01:40:19,226 --> 01:40:20,784
Right, Miss Teschmacher.

913
01:40:24,431 --> 01:40:25,921
"N."

914
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:29,068
"M"? You want "M," Mr. Luthor?
Coming right up.

915
01:40:30,838 --> 01:40:32,430
So there you go, "M."

916
01:40:32,573 --> 01:40:34,598
"M" as in "moron," Otis? No.

917
01:40:34,875 --> 01:40:36,900
It’s "N" as in "Neanderthal"...

918
01:40:37,244 --> 01:40:39,974
..."nincompoop," "nitwit,"
and "L" as in "ladder."

919
01:40:40,047 --> 01:40:41,810
Here’s a ladder, coming right up.

920
01:40:41,916 --> 01:40:43,884
I didn’t see....

921
01:40:44,451 --> 01:40:45,850
I’m sorry, Mr. Luthor.

922
01:40:47,721 --> 01:40:50,986
In the interview he says
that the planet Krypton...

923
01:40:52,893 --> 01:40:54,758
...exploded in 1948.

924
01:40:55,396 --> 01:40:57,057
That ridiculous little freak...

925
01:40:57,765 --> 01:41:00,233
...took three years in a rocket
to get to earth.

926
01:41:00,968 --> 01:41:02,595
-Ergo....
-Ergo.

927
01:41:02,870 --> 01:41:05,464
Ergo 1948, that’s three years on.

928
01:41:06,373 --> 01:41:07,806
He’s 6’ 4", you know that?

929
01:41:08,008 --> 01:41:12,911
Do you know why the number 200 is
so vitally descriptive to both you and me?

930
01:41:13,414 --> 01:41:14,938
It’s your weight and my l.Q.

931
01:41:15,049 --> 01:41:16,414
Think, people, think.

932
01:41:17,818 --> 01:41:20,753
Deductive reasoning.
That’s the name of the game.

933
01:41:22,723 --> 01:41:24,657
Fragments from the planet Krypton...

934
01:41:25,392 --> 01:41:27,485
...exploded and went into outer space.

935
01:41:27,661 --> 01:41:29,458
It is reasonable to assume...

936
01:41:29,563 --> 01:41:32,555
...that some of those particles of debris
drifted to Earth.

937
01:41:35,502 --> 01:41:36,400
Meteorites!

938
01:41:37,004 --> 01:41:37,936
Jawohl.

939
01:41:39,807 --> 01:41:40,535
Voilà!

940
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:47,644
Voilà!

941
01:41:52,152 --> 01:41:54,586
A meteorite found in Addis Ababa?

942
01:41:55,789 --> 01:41:58,314
I know l’ll get rapped
in the mouth for this, but...

943
01:41:58,392 --> 01:41:59,552
...so what?

944
01:42:00,094 --> 01:42:02,756
So what? You mean to us
they’re just meteorites.

945
01:42:03,697 --> 01:42:04,664
Fair enough.

946
01:42:05,599 --> 01:42:08,124
But the level of specific radioactivity...

947
01:42:08,202 --> 01:42:10,864
...is so high to anyone
from the planet Krypton...

948
01:42:10,938 --> 01:42:12,428
...this substance is lethal.

949
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:15,007
Wait a minute, Mr. Luthor.

950
01:42:15,409 --> 01:42:18,037
Fire and bullets can’t hurt this guy...

951
01:42:18,212 --> 01:42:19,645
...but this stuff here...

952
01:42:19,713 --> 01:42:21,874
...will kill him.

953
01:42:25,386 --> 01:42:27,354
Doesn’t it give you a kind of...

954
01:42:27,421 --> 01:42:31,118
...a shudder of electricity through you
to be in the same room with me?

955
01:42:32,559 --> 01:42:35,585
Not like the shudder you’ll get
when you lay that rock on him.

956
01:42:35,829 --> 01:42:38,957
He can see you coming for miles
with those super peepers of his.

957
01:42:39,266 --> 01:42:42,633
O Lord, you gave them eyes,
but they cannot see...

958
01:42:43,304 --> 01:42:45,465
...nor can Superman, through lead.

959
01:42:47,341 --> 01:42:49,707
He can’t see through lead?

960
01:42:50,277 --> 01:42:52,268
And Kryptonite will destroy him.

961
01:42:55,950 --> 01:42:57,281
Any questions, class?

962
01:42:58,686 --> 01:43:00,950
I wonder what they’re wearing
in Addis Ababa?

963
01:43:01,388 --> 01:43:02,855
Looks like a burnoose.

964
01:43:03,223 --> 01:43:05,054
It’s just a wraparound.

965
01:43:05,492 --> 01:43:08,222
Are we going to Addis Ababa, Mr. Luthor?

966
01:43:09,263 --> 01:43:11,322
Mother Bird to Missile Convoy, over.

967
01:43:11,799 --> 01:43:14,063
Missile Convoy to Mother Bird, go ahead.

968
01:43:14,301 --> 01:43:18,237
Everything looks good,
see you at the base. Over and out.

969
01:43:18,739 --> 01:43:21,105
Roger, Mother Bird. Over and out.

970
01:44:04,451 --> 01:44:05,418
Look at this!

971
01:44:06,186 --> 01:44:07,414
Looks pretty bad.

972
01:44:12,226 --> 01:44:13,352
Take her pulse.

973
01:44:23,804 --> 01:44:25,499
Get an ambulance down here.

974
01:44:25,572 --> 01:44:28,302
I don’t want to hold this convoy up
more than I have to.

975
01:44:28,976 --> 01:44:31,444
She’s having trouble breathing.
What do you think?

976
01:44:31,512 --> 01:44:34,504
I suggest a vigorous chest massage.

977
01:44:34,581 --> 01:44:37,072
If that doesn’t work, mouth-to-mouth.

978
01:44:37,184 --> 01:44:38,173
Yes, sir!

979
01:44:39,820 --> 01:44:43,153
I won’t have my men do anything
I wouldn’t be prepared to do myself.

980
01:44:43,390 --> 01:44:44,482
Get an ambulance.

981
01:44:44,858 --> 01:44:45,916
Gather around.

982
01:44:47,795 --> 01:44:48,853
Turn around!

983
01:45:17,057 --> 01:45:18,046
Hi.

984
01:45:18,792 --> 01:45:19,816
Somebody hurt?

985
01:45:36,143 --> 01:45:38,873
I did it, Mr. Luthor.

986
01:45:39,513 --> 01:45:41,208
Miss Teschmacher, I did it.

987
01:45:41,849 --> 01:45:44,682
-Just like you told me.
-All right, Otis.

988
01:45:44,785 --> 01:45:46,844
It isn’t that I don’t trust you, but....

989
01:45:48,122 --> 01:45:50,386
I don’t trust you, Otis. What did you do?

990
01:45:51,492 --> 01:45:55,155
I set the first directional vector...

991
01:45:55,596 --> 01:45:57,086
...to 38.

992
01:45:57,331 --> 01:46:01,233
The second one to 67.
And the third one to 1 17.

993
01:46:01,502 --> 01:46:02,935
What about the fourth one?

994
01:46:03,403 --> 01:46:04,631
What fourth one?

995
01:46:04,838 --> 01:46:08,205
Wait a minute. The third one to 1 17?

996
01:46:08,375 --> 01:46:12,004
-Yes. See, I wrote it down, Mr. Luthor.
-Otis!

997
01:46:13,147 --> 01:46:16,173
The third one was supposed to be 1 1,
and the fourth one, 7.

998
01:46:18,318 --> 01:46:20,479
Oh, gee, Mr. Luthor.

999
01:46:20,821 --> 01:46:23,483
I guess my arm wasn’t long enough, see.

1000
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:25,717
Would you like to see a long arm?

1001
01:46:26,059 --> 01:46:29,517
Otis, would you like to see
a very, very, long arm?

1002
01:46:29,596 --> 01:46:30,790
No, Mr. Luthor.

1003
01:46:45,145 --> 01:46:48,308
-All right. Get it right.
-Yes, Mr. Luthor.

1004
01:46:50,951 --> 01:46:53,886
MacDonald, I thought you told me
this road would be blocked off?

1005
01:46:53,954 --> 01:46:57,185
-Jablowsky, didn’t I tell you--
-I didn’t asked him, I asked you.

1006
01:46:58,525 --> 01:47:00,254
All right. Follow me, men.

1007
01:47:01,962 --> 01:47:05,193
Back that thing off the road.
Back it off the road.

1008
01:47:15,108 --> 01:47:18,043
You’ll have to circle back.
I don’t have time to argue.

1009
01:47:18,111 --> 01:47:19,772
It’s a heck of a day, isn’t it?

1010
01:47:27,454 --> 01:47:30,116
-Route 12? That’s back there.
-No, sir, it’s up there.

1011
01:47:33,193 --> 01:47:36,754
-Sergeant, we took the wrong road.
-I’m a Lieutenant. A Naval Officer.

1012
01:47:44,304 --> 01:47:47,569
Shut up! Now Route 12 is back that way.

1013
01:47:53,780 --> 01:47:55,873
This man is a diabetic, you see.

1014
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:10,857
As you know, the Daily Planet
is very interested in that dam...

1015
01:48:11,231 --> 01:48:12,994
...but what I don’t understand...

1016
01:48:13,066 --> 01:48:16,092
...is why you’d sell out to a faceless person
you’ve never met?

1017
01:48:16,169 --> 01:48:17,568
You don’t know his name.

1018
01:48:21,375 --> 01:48:23,707
At the stupid high price he offered...

1019
01:48:23,777 --> 01:48:26,211
...for this worthless piece of desert...

1020
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:28,145
...l hope it’s Custer!

1021
01:48:30,317 --> 01:48:32,512
perfect, just what I need. Thank you.

1022
01:48:33,287 --> 01:48:36,552
Reporting live from the launch site,
ground zero.

1023
01:48:37,991 --> 01:48:41,154
Today marks a historic occasion since...

1024
01:48:41,395 --> 01:48:45,593
...two XK-101 rockets will be
launched simultaneously.

1025
01:48:46,566 --> 01:48:49,296
One by the Army, and one by the Navy.

1026
01:48:49,369 --> 01:48:51,735
Hi, everybody.
Has anybody seen Lois today?

1027
01:48:51,805 --> 01:48:54,035
No, but the Chief wants to see you.

1028
01:48:54,107 --> 01:48:55,938
You’re blocking the set, Clark.

1029
01:48:56,743 --> 01:48:59,371
Sorry, Gil. How’s Judy today? Okay?

1030
01:48:59,446 --> 01:49:00,276
Good.

1031
01:49:01,181 --> 01:49:02,478
Excuse me, Mr. White.

1032
01:49:02,582 --> 01:49:05,517
You wanted to see me, sir?
Have you seen Lois today?

1033
01:49:06,453 --> 01:49:08,785
She’s out West,
looking into a land-fraud deal.

1034
01:49:09,122 --> 01:49:11,750
I sent young Olsen with her
on his first assignment.

1035
01:49:11,825 --> 01:49:15,124
Some unidentified clown
is buying thousands of acres...

1036
01:49:15,195 --> 01:49:17,425
...of worthless desert at incredible prices.

1037
01:49:17,564 --> 01:49:19,259
That doesn’t seem to make sense.

1038
01:49:19,333 --> 01:49:21,961
The world doesn’t make sense.
You ought to know that.

1039
01:49:22,502 --> 01:49:24,629
Look at this dispatch from Addis Ababa.

1040
01:49:25,005 --> 01:49:28,998
people break into a museum at night,
kill two people, and what do they take?

1041
01:49:29,076 --> 01:49:31,738
A worthless piece of meteorite.
How do you figure that?

1042
01:49:32,746 --> 01:49:35,442
I’ve never been able
to understand violence.

1043
01:49:36,049 --> 01:49:37,414
I know that about you.

1044
01:49:37,551 --> 01:49:39,485
That’s why I wanted to talk to you.

1045
01:49:40,554 --> 01:49:43,352
I’ve been in this news game
40 years man and boy...

1046
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:47,221
...and I got where I am
with guts, compassion...

1047
01:49:47,661 --> 01:49:50,687
...elbow grease and something
you’re sadly lacking in, son.

1048
01:49:51,665 --> 01:49:52,461
Humility?

1049
01:49:52,799 --> 01:49:55,359
Not humility, you’ve got bags of humility.

1050
01:49:55,869 --> 01:49:58,064
Aggression, confidence, that’s the ticket.

1051
01:49:58,405 --> 01:50:00,532
Take charge.
Let people know who you are.

1052
01:50:09,149 --> 01:50:10,707
This is Lex Luthor.

1053
01:50:11,284 --> 01:50:14,845
Only one thing alive with less than
four legs can hear this frequency.

1054
01:50:14,921 --> 01:50:15,910
That’s you.

1055
01:50:16,323 --> 01:50:21,022
In five minutes, a poisoned gas pellet
containing propane lithium compound...

1056
01:50:21,661 --> 01:50:24,789
...willbe released through thousands
of air ducts in this city...

1057
01:50:24,865 --> 01:50:28,301
...effectively annihilating
half the population of Metropolis.

1058
01:50:28,368 --> 01:50:31,496
I was a reporter before most of my friends
were copy boys.

1059
01:50:31,905 --> 01:50:34,635
I want you to get Lois
to introduce you to Superman.

1060
01:50:34,841 --> 01:50:38,004
Find out who he is.
Where did he get that blue suit?

1061
01:50:38,211 --> 01:50:40,941
Did he have it made?
ls it silk? ls it plastic?

1062
01:50:41,648 --> 01:50:43,411
I know it all seems a bit much...

1063
01:50:43,483 --> 01:50:45,917
...but how else was I going to meet you,
Superman?

1064
01:50:46,086 --> 01:50:49,283
I knew you’d never accept
an invitation to tea.

1065
01:50:50,657 --> 01:50:54,855
But a disaster, with people in danger,
people who needhelp....

1066
01:50:56,430 --> 01:51:00,560
I just knew you couldn’t resist
that chance to sort of pitch in.

1067
01:51:01,368 --> 01:51:02,699
You know what I mean?

1068
01:51:36,069 --> 01:51:39,266
There’s a strong streak of good in you,
Superman.

1069
01:51:40,407 --> 01:51:42,102
But then nobody’s perfect.

1070
01:51:45,579 --> 01:51:46,944
Almost nobody.

1071
01:51:56,223 --> 01:51:57,554
-Oh, Superman!
-Gee!

1072
01:51:57,958 --> 01:52:00,893
Stand back, please.
Nothing to get worried about.

1073
01:52:06,733 --> 01:52:08,598
Don't sit there like a numskull, get out!

1074
01:52:22,516 --> 01:52:24,984
Look at that overgrown boy scout,
Miss Teschmacher.

1075
01:52:25,819 --> 01:52:27,218
Tell me what you see?

1076
01:52:28,388 --> 01:52:30,185
Cuteness, dimples.

1077
01:52:31,024 --> 01:52:32,150
You like cuteness?

1078
01:52:33,326 --> 01:52:34,088
Dimples.

1079
01:52:35,128 --> 01:52:36,459
I’ll give you dimples.

1080
01:53:11,197 --> 01:53:13,188
The pressure is still on you.

1081
01:53:13,934 --> 01:53:16,232
You know they say.:
If you can’t stand the heat...

1082
01:53:16,303 --> 01:53:17,770
...get out of the tunnel.

1083
01:53:41,261 --> 01:53:43,024
It’s your last chance, Superman.

1084
01:53:44,064 --> 01:53:46,464
Why don’t you do yourself a favor
and freeze.

1085
01:54:48,128 --> 01:54:49,823
I think he’s coming, Mr. Luthor.

1086
01:55:01,007 --> 01:55:02,804
He’s definitely coming.

1087
01:55:14,421 --> 01:55:15,683
It’s open, come in.

1088
01:55:18,425 --> 01:55:21,656
My attorney will be in touch with you
about the damage to the door.

1089
01:55:21,895 --> 01:55:23,590
Otis, take the gentleman’s cape.

1090
01:55:29,502 --> 01:55:31,299
I don’t think he wants me to.

1091
01:55:31,371 --> 01:55:32,770
Where’s the gas pellet?

1092
01:55:33,273 --> 01:55:34,137
Somewhere.

1093
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:38,567
It’s in the back of my mind, actually.

1094
01:55:39,713 --> 01:55:41,544
It’s a little idea I was toying with.

1095
01:55:41,614 --> 01:55:44,242
Is that how a warped brain like yours
gets its kicks?

1096
01:55:44,317 --> 01:55:46,444
By planning the death of innocent people?

1097
01:55:46,653 --> 01:55:49,554
No. By causing the death
of innocent people.

1098
01:55:49,622 --> 01:55:50,611
Fire!

1099
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:55,994
Navy Bird, we have a good launch.

1100
01:56:07,307 --> 01:56:09,775
As you may or may not know,
I am, as they say...

1101
01:56:10,643 --> 01:56:12,440
...very heavy into real estate.

1102
01:56:13,079 --> 01:56:17,345
To make money, you have to buy
for a little and sell for a lot, right?

1103
01:56:17,717 --> 01:56:18,684
Right.

1104
01:56:20,220 --> 01:56:21,710
So, the problem?

1105
01:56:22,989 --> 01:56:26,117
How to make the land more valuable
between the time you buy it...

1106
01:56:26,192 --> 01:56:27,750
...and the time you sell it?

1107
01:56:28,661 --> 01:56:30,561
Now this is California.

1108
01:56:31,231 --> 01:56:33,495
The richest, most populous state
in the Union.

1109
01:56:33,566 --> 01:56:35,727
I don’t need a geography lesson from you.

1110
01:56:36,569 --> 01:56:40,198
Of course, you’ve been there.
I do forget, you get around, don’t you?

1111
01:56:40,974 --> 01:56:41,998
Where was l?

1112
01:56:42,542 --> 01:56:44,237
-California.
-California, right.

1113
01:56:44,310 --> 01:56:46,938
The San Andreas Fault,
maybe you’ve heard of it?

1114
01:56:47,013 --> 01:56:49,345
Yes. It’s the joining together
of two land masses.

1115
01:56:49,415 --> 01:56:53,112
The fault line is shifting, which is why
you get earthquakes in California.

1116
01:56:53,853 --> 01:56:56,219
Wonderful!
Couldn’t have said it better myself.

1117
01:56:57,090 --> 01:57:01,322
Everything west of this line is the richest,
most expensive real estate in the world.

1118
01:57:01,461 --> 01:57:04,055
San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco.

1119
01:57:04,130 --> 01:57:06,064
Everything on this side of the line...

1120
01:57:06,166 --> 01:57:09,192
...is just hundreds of miles
of worthless desert land...

1121
01:57:09,269 --> 01:57:11,328
...which just happens to be owned by....

1122
01:57:11,638 --> 01:57:13,765
Lex Luthor Incorporated.

1123
01:57:15,041 --> 01:57:18,533
Now, call me foolish, call me irresponsible.

1124
01:57:19,512 --> 01:57:22,572
It occurs to me that a 500-megaton bomb...

1125
01:57:22,916 --> 01:57:25,384
...planted at just the proper point would....

1126
01:57:25,685 --> 01:57:27,915
Would destroy most of California.

1127
01:57:29,455 --> 01:57:33,152
Millions of people would be killed
and the West Coast as we know it would....

1128
01:57:33,226 --> 01:57:36,525
Fall into the sea. Bye-bye, California.

1129
01:57:37,630 --> 01:57:40,224
Hello, new West Coast. My West Coast.

1130
01:57:42,869 --> 01:57:44,564
Costa Del Lex, Luthorville.

1131
01:57:45,138 --> 01:57:46,662
Marina Del Lex, Otisburg.

1132
01:57:49,676 --> 01:57:50,938
"Otisburg"?

1133
01:57:51,110 --> 01:57:53,442
Miss Teschmacher,
she’s got her own place.

1134
01:57:53,513 --> 01:57:54,445
"Otisburg"?

1135
01:57:54,747 --> 01:57:56,214
It’s a little bitty place.

1136
01:57:56,382 --> 01:57:57,371
Otisburg?

1137
01:57:58,718 --> 01:58:01,016
I’ll just wipe it off, that’s all.

1138
01:58:01,154 --> 01:58:02,883
You’re a dreamer, Lex Luthor.

1139
01:58:02,956 --> 01:58:05,948
A sick, twisted dreamer.
Your plan couldn’t possibly work.

1140
01:58:06,593 --> 01:58:08,652
I’ll admit there were a few problems.

1141
01:58:09,128 --> 01:58:11,722
Adjusting the precise trajectory
of the missile.

1142
01:58:12,232 --> 01:58:15,326
Finding the optimum stress point
for the fault line itself...

1143
01:58:16,236 --> 01:58:19,569
...which, by the way, is target zero.
Right...

1144
01:58:20,406 --> 01:58:21,134
...here.

1145
01:58:46,532 --> 01:58:47,624
That’s impossible!

1146
01:58:50,904 --> 01:58:52,633
What’s happening, Lieutenant?

1147
01:58:52,705 --> 01:58:54,263
Trajectory malfunction, sir.

1148
01:58:56,576 --> 01:58:57,440
Abort.

1149
01:58:58,478 --> 01:58:59,945
All counter control units...

1150
01:59:00,013 --> 01:59:02,106
...remove vacuum pressure to maximum.

1151
01:59:04,517 --> 01:59:05,848
Function negative, sir.

1152
01:59:05,919 --> 01:59:07,284
Can’t you knock them down?

1153
01:59:07,353 --> 01:59:11,687
Absolutely impossible, sir. They have
the new p-20 low-level avoidance systems.

1154
01:59:11,758 --> 01:59:13,225
Get me the pentagon.

1155
01:59:20,566 --> 01:59:23,160
What do you think, super baby?
Interesting?

1156
01:59:23,636 --> 01:59:25,797
Your theory’s quite impressive, Luthor.

1157
01:59:25,872 --> 01:59:28,136
Would you go to the viewing room, please?

1158
01:59:28,975 --> 01:59:31,842
But as for the rest,
it’s nothing but a sick fantasy.

1159
01:59:31,978 --> 01:59:32,876
Fantasy?

1160
01:59:33,212 --> 01:59:34,144
No.

1161
01:59:35,214 --> 01:59:37,546
It’s history. It’s happening, Superman.

1162
01:59:38,351 --> 01:59:39,978
Miss Teschmacher!

1163
01:59:44,757 --> 01:59:46,019
Yes, Lex?

1164
01:59:46,392 --> 01:59:47,791
Where’s the rocket now?

1165
01:59:48,027 --> 01:59:51,690
It’s going like a bat over the Grand Canyon,
so is the other one.

1166
01:59:51,798 --> 01:59:52,856
The other one?

1167
01:59:53,166 --> 01:59:54,531
There are two of them?

1168
01:59:57,570 --> 01:59:59,868
Yes, Superman, double jeopardy.

1169
02:00:00,540 --> 02:00:03,475
Even you, with your great speed,
couldn’t stop both of them.

1170
02:00:03,710 --> 02:00:06,770
While l, on the other hand,
could stop them with my detonator.

1171
02:00:07,246 --> 02:00:09,043
All right, Luthor, where is it?

1172
02:00:09,749 --> 02:00:11,148
Where’s the detonator?

1173
02:00:24,664 --> 02:00:26,154
Diseased maniac!

1174
02:00:26,566 --> 02:00:29,558
Do you think you could hide it from me
by encasing it in lead?

1175
02:00:31,771 --> 02:00:34,171
I’ll mold this box into your prison bars.

1176
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:35,400
Don't touch that.

1177
02:00:42,215 --> 02:00:43,273
I told you.

1178
02:00:44,017 --> 02:00:45,279
It’s Kryptonite.

1179
02:00:45,485 --> 02:00:47,453
A little souvenir from your hometown.

1180
02:00:47,954 --> 02:00:50,422
I’ve spared no expense
to make you feel at home.

1181
02:00:57,930 --> 02:00:59,454
You were great in your day.

1182
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:02,431
But it just stands to reason...

1183
02:01:02,769 --> 02:01:04,999
...when it came time
to cash in your chips...

1184
02:01:05,438 --> 02:01:09,966
...this old diseased maniac
would be your banker.

1185
02:01:14,447 --> 02:01:15,539
Mind over muscle.

1186
02:01:24,190 --> 02:01:28,320
You don’t even care
where the other missile’s headed, do you?

1187
02:01:28,795 --> 02:01:29,955
Certainly I do.

1188
02:01:31,464 --> 02:01:33,329
I know exactly where it’s headed.

1189
02:01:33,466 --> 02:01:34,899
Hackensack, New Jersey.

1190
02:01:40,706 --> 02:01:45,109
I have to leave you now. No hard feelings.
We all have our little faults.

1191
02:01:45,878 --> 02:01:47,368
Mine’s in California.

1192
02:02:02,228 --> 02:02:05,095
Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack.

1193
02:03:11,731 --> 02:03:13,494
please, you can’t...

1194
02:03:14,100 --> 02:03:15,761
...you can’t just stand there.

1195
02:03:19,338 --> 02:03:23,832
You can’t just stand
and let millions of innocent people die.

1196
02:03:24,710 --> 02:03:25,540
Maybe.

1197
02:03:27,413 --> 02:03:29,881
please. please, help me to save them.

1198
02:03:32,118 --> 02:03:34,609
Would you promise
to save my mother first?

1199
02:03:35,755 --> 02:03:37,723
But, Lois, and Jimmy....

1200
02:03:37,790 --> 02:03:39,451
But my mother comes first.

1201
02:03:39,525 --> 02:03:42,983
If you promise, l’ll believe you
because you always tell the truth.

1202
02:03:45,398 --> 02:03:47,025
I promise, I promise.

1203
02:04:42,455 --> 02:04:43,922
Why did you kiss me first?

1204
02:04:46,892 --> 02:04:49,122
I didn’t think you’d let me later.

1205
02:04:50,429 --> 02:04:51,919
Thank you, Miss Teschmacher.

1206
02:04:52,531 --> 02:04:55,591
Why is it I can’t get it on
with the good guys?

1207
02:05:01,641 --> 02:05:04,269
Stand aside now.
I wouldn’t stay here, either.

1208
02:05:23,229 --> 02:05:24,992
Army Bird still heading due east.

1209
02:05:25,064 --> 02:05:26,827
Navy Bird still heading due west.

1210
02:05:26,899 --> 02:05:28,366
Losing radar contact.

1211
02:05:28,934 --> 02:05:30,731
Next radar contact after three seconds.

1212
02:05:52,158 --> 02:05:54,058
Army Bird still headed east, sir.

1213
02:06:48,981 --> 02:06:50,710
Army Bird gaining altitude.

1214
02:06:50,783 --> 02:06:52,273
Miss Teschmacher!

1215
02:06:52,551 --> 02:06:54,348
Radar contact strong.

1216
02:06:55,354 --> 02:06:56,685
Miss Teschmacher!

1217
02:06:57,022 --> 02:06:59,286
Radar report Navy Bird. San Andreas area.

1218
02:07:02,628 --> 02:07:04,926
Navy Bird heading down,
15 seconds to impact.

1219
02:07:05,464 --> 02:07:06,863
15 seconds and counting.

1220
02:08:05,925 --> 02:08:09,190
A military missile has exploded
in the Southern California desert.

1221
02:08:09,628 --> 02:08:12,563
The force of the explosion has activated
the San Andreas fault.

1222
02:08:12,631 --> 02:08:14,895
California is suffering a major earthquake.

1223
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:02,211
What’s going on?

1224
02:09:04,383 --> 02:09:05,611
It’s a quake! Look!

1225
02:10:14,386 --> 02:10:16,081
Okay, kids, it’s all right now.

1226
02:10:16,889 --> 02:10:18,413
Hey, it’s Superman!

1227
02:10:26,999 --> 02:10:28,626
Holy mackerel!

1228
02:10:29,868 --> 02:10:31,335
We’re going off the tracks.

1229
02:11:07,539 --> 02:11:09,006
All personnel evacuate dam.

1230
02:11:21,420 --> 02:11:22,580
Watch that cable!

1231
02:11:30,295 --> 02:11:31,990
Someone try and pull the main.

1232
02:11:32,331 --> 02:11:34,196
It’s impossible. It’s red hot!

1233
02:11:42,808 --> 02:11:44,139
Is that man all right?

1234
02:11:44,276 --> 02:11:45,243
Yeah.

1235
02:12:09,134 --> 02:12:10,101
Hang on, Jim.

1236
02:12:21,013 --> 02:12:22,173
The dam broke.

1237
02:12:30,255 --> 02:12:31,552
You’re safe here, son.

1238
02:12:33,258 --> 02:12:35,886
That’s okay. Miss Lane
will be driving by any minute.

1239
02:12:45,204 --> 02:12:46,899
-Come on!
-Make it to the hill.

1240
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:57,449
There has been major quake damage
to Southern California.

1241
02:12:57,716 --> 02:13:00,276
The San Andreas fault has miraculously
sealed itself.

1242
02:13:00,352 --> 02:13:04,345
Yet Southern California is suffering
an aftershock of a major earthquake.

1243
02:13:04,890 --> 02:13:07,188
The population is still warned
to be aware....

1244
02:13:09,261 --> 02:13:10,785
Please, come on, turn over.

1245
02:13:11,930 --> 02:13:12,726
Come on!

1246
02:13:40,359 --> 02:13:43,192
Help me. Help me, please.

1247
02:18:55,807 --> 02:18:57,900
It is forbidden for you to interfere....

1248
02:18:58,510 --> 02:19:02,503
There’s one thing I do know, Son,
and that is you are here for a reason.

1249
02:19:04,082 --> 02:19:05,174
It is forbidden.

1250
02:19:05,250 --> 02:19:08,583
All those things I can do,
all those powers...

1251
02:19:09,121 --> 02:19:11,146
...but I couldn’t even save him.

1252
02:19:15,093 --> 02:19:16,560
It is forbidden.

1253
02:20:41,980 --> 02:20:42,708
Hi.

1254
02:20:44,749 --> 02:20:46,239
Don't bother, it’s dead.

1255
02:20:48,486 --> 02:20:49,510
Sure it’s dead.

1256
02:20:51,356 --> 02:20:54,814
The problem with men of steel is
they’re never around when you want one.

1257
02:20:54,893 --> 02:20:57,623
Do you know what happened
while you were off flying around?

1258
02:20:57,696 --> 02:21:01,496
I was almost in an earthquake.
A gas station blew up beside my car.

1259
02:21:01,566 --> 02:21:05,468
Telephone poles falling all over the road.
I was almost killed.

1260
02:21:05,537 --> 02:21:08,597
To top the whole thing off,
this stupid car runs out of gas.

1261
02:21:08,873 --> 02:21:10,101
I’m sorry about that, Lois.

1262
02:21:10,742 --> 02:21:12,767
But I've been kind of busy for a while.

1263
02:21:15,647 --> 02:21:17,774
I’m sorry, that’s all right.

1264
02:21:29,894 --> 02:21:31,225
Thanks a lot, Superman.

1265
02:21:31,563 --> 02:21:33,997
put me in the middle of nowhere
during an earthquake.

1266
02:21:34,065 --> 02:21:37,762
No food, no water, snakes everywhere.
I had no idea if you were coming back.

1267
02:21:40,405 --> 02:21:43,101
There’s something I have to do.
I’ll see you later.

1268
02:21:45,910 --> 02:21:47,502
He can’t stay still for a second.

1269
02:21:50,548 --> 02:21:54,109
Golly, Miss Lane, it’s too bad
Mr. Kent wasn’t here to see all this.

1270
02:21:54,185 --> 02:21:56,915
Yeah, poor Clark.
He’s never around when....

1271
02:21:58,390 --> 02:22:00,415
Clark.... Wait a minute.

1272
02:22:00,925 --> 02:22:01,584
What?

1273
02:22:03,161 --> 02:22:05,129
Lois Lane, that is the silliest idea.

1274
02:22:05,597 --> 02:22:09,124
I’ll tell you something, Miss Lane.
I think he really cares about you.

1275
02:22:09,434 --> 02:22:11,595
-Clark? Of course, he does.
-No, not Clark.

1276
02:22:15,940 --> 02:22:17,931
Superman cares about everybody, Jimmy.

1277
02:22:19,110 --> 02:22:22,511
But who knows. Someday, if he’s lucky....

1278
02:22:35,894 --> 02:22:37,361
You’re messing up my suit!

1279
02:22:41,766 --> 02:22:44,166
Otis! Watch the ground, you....

1280
02:22:45,136 --> 02:22:46,569
Good evening, Warden.

1281
02:22:46,638 --> 02:22:49,664
These two men should be safe here
’til they can get a fair trial.

1282
02:22:49,808 --> 02:22:51,070
Who is it, Superman?

1283
02:22:53,311 --> 02:22:54,209
Lex Luthor.

1284
02:22:55,013 --> 02:22:57,641
-The greatest criminal mind of our time.
-Of our time.

1285
02:22:57,749 --> 02:23:00,047
-I hereby serve notice...
-He’s serving notice to you.

1286
02:23:00,118 --> 02:23:01,710
...that these walls--

1287
02:23:02,053 --> 02:23:04,044
Will you shut up, you fat little fool!

1288
02:23:04,222 --> 02:23:05,450
You, you nitwit!

1289
02:23:05,724 --> 02:23:06,850
Nincompoop!

1290
02:23:07,292 --> 02:23:08,520
This country...

1291
02:23:08,593 --> 02:23:11,187
...is safe again, Superman, thanks to you.

1292
02:23:11,696 --> 02:23:12,458
No, sir.

1293
02:23:12,530 --> 02:23:13,861
Don't thank me, Warden.

1294
02:23:14,232 --> 02:23:16,029
We’re all part of the same team.

1295
02:23:16,534 --> 02:23:17,523
Good night.

1296
02:23:18,305 --> 02:23:24,837
