Johnny: <i> Talk to me, Ray.</i>

00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:36,235
<i>Low on gas and almost
out of ammo, Johnny.</i>

5
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:39,077
Johnny: <i> God damn it.</i>
<i>This isn't supposed</i>
<i>to be happening in this area.</i>

00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:43,275
Soldier 1: Retreat! Let's go!
Soldier 2: Move it! Move it!

00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,110

00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:54,119
<i>Gotta go home and refuel,
come back for them.</i>

11
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:56,201
<i>If we go, there'll be no one
left to come back for.</i>

12
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,690
-Soldier 1: Move it!
Move! Move!

Ray: <i>We're hit!</i>
Johnny: <i> Mayday! Mayday!</i>

15
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,078
<i>Dragonfly 2 going down!</i>

17
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,558
Johnny: Come on, Ray.
Let's go. Come on, Ray.

18
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,259
(Bullets ricocheting)

19
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,694
Come on, Ray, let's go!

00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,613

Johnny: What's going on?

30
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,184
Hey, you will not.

31
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,654
No, you can't. No!

32
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,925
-Ray: No!
-You're all right, Ray.
Just stay cool.

33
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:14,407
- You're all right.
- Johnny, help me.

34
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,869
No! Ray!

35
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,262
Sniper: Here come
the visa crew.

36
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,424
Log 'em in.

37
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,728
Range finder: Murdock, Alvin.

38
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,430
Purvell, Robert.

39
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,334
Su, Joyce.

40
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,404
Rosenbaum, Naomi.

41
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,845
- (Engine revving)
- What the hell is that?

42
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,715
Sniper: That is Kate abbott.

43
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,953
The new security officer.

44
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,604
Vip request.
We need to process it.

45
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:06,772
Okay.

46
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,042
- Sorry, Sally.
- What's the rush, Sam?

47
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:11,376
Security breach.

48
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,378
Everybody in the
conference room in 10.

49
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,716
Nero Franks, Maltese National.

50
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,518
Over the weekend,
he tried to board
an oceanic airlines flight

51
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,787
from Heathrow to Chicago.

52
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:24,056
Alarms went off when Franks
presented his passport.

53
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:27,459
It didn't have
the new digital watermark.
Franks tried to run.

54
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,661
MI5 thought he was
a suicide bomber

55
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,063
and took him out. Take a look.

56
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:33,365
Abbott: Nero Franks was
a scientist with no priors,

57
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,866
working for
a German chemical outfit.

58
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,402
His specialty
was combustible gas munitions.

59
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:38,837
The brits and the Germans
are still looking

60
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,472
for a possible
terrorist connection,

61
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,407
but no joy so far.

62
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,009
So here's the issue
for us, people.

63
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,611
Now our enemies know
they can't forge Visas.

64
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,947
That means they'll be looking
for ways to get real ones,

65
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,549
the kind you hand out
every day.

66
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,818
We're working with all
the British security agencies,

67
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,686
but they're stretched
really thin.

68
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,422
Budget cuts, plus they have
homegrown terrorists
to worry about.

69
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,092
We're not saying that you
have to give everyone
the third degree.

70
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:02,694
90% of our applicants
are straightforward.

71
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:06,832
It's the remaining 10%
that I lose sleep over.

72
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:10,369
Any application that tweaks
you the wrong way,
take it straight to Kate.

73
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,471
She excelled at this work
in Washington.

74
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:14,573
What Sam really means is
you'll need someone to blame

75
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,108
if the wrong guy gets
through, so use me.

76
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:20,579
What I'm really interested in
is anyone
with scientific expertise,

77
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,681
specialists in chemicals
or gases.

78
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,850
Any questions?

79
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,451
All right, gang. Back to work.
(Sighs)

80
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,599
That's fine, madam.
Your visa will be ready
tomorrow.

81
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,435
She's never seen the ball drop
in Times Square
on New Year's Eve.

82
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:45,103
Have a good stay
in the United States, sister.

83
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,773
Thank you, sir.

84
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:50,142
So do you promise to watch me
when I'm on <i> American Idol?</i>

85
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:51,476
Oh, absolutely.

86
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,946
What?

87
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,982
- Have a good stay.
- Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

88
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,426
(Computer chimes)

89
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,076
Dr. Balan, good afternoon.

90
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,448
I was told my paperwork
is in order.

91
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,018
This won't take long.

92
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,619
Romanian citizen.

93
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,726
You have listed
a medical conference

94
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,528
as the reason for visiting
the United States.

95
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,530
Yes.

96
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,669
This conference is
for pediatricians.

97
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,504
You're a general practitioner.

98
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,940
I work in a clinic
for newly arrived immigrants.

99
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:58,677
Many of my patients
are children.

100
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:03,081
Dr. Balan, it also says
that you consult
for Vicker's pharmaceuticals.

101
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,684
I'm curious why we don't have
a letter from them.

102
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,052
I've only been there
a few months.

103
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:10,088
- Is there a problem?
- I certainly hope not.

104
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,256
Let me see this file.

105
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,492
I'm not done with my review.

106
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,026
A word.

107
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,006
You don't think it's strange
that a GP,

108
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,207
who also happens
to be a researcher,

109
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,576
wants to attend
a pediatrics conference?

110
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,178
There's nothing odd
about moonlighting
as a consultant

111
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,813
to make a few extra bucks.

112
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,115
Besides, Naomi already did
the background check.

113
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,050
- Balan's fine.
- I'll be the judge of that.

114
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,253
Look, I know you were
a high-flyer in D.C.

115
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:42,921
I am not here on vacation.

116
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,256
Even when it's slow,

117
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:45,757
we're not processing people
fast enough.

118
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,826
We're seriously understaffed.

119
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,761
So when paperwork
gets held up by security,

120
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,530
people start missing flights,

121
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,565
and I'm the one that has to
deal with their complaints.

122
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,407
Unless you wanna suffer
the ambassador's wrath.

123
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,936
I'm doing my job, Bill.

124
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,705
We all are.

125
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:16,621
We have a problem.
A new security expert.

126
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,323
From Washington.

127
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,163
Her name is Kate Abbott.
She knows about Vicker's.

128
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,666
So no visa?

129
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,635
She's trouble,
I'm telling you.

130
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,239
I'll take care of her.

131
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,651
(Buzzer rings)

132
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,322
(Door unlocking)

133
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,126
Woman: This way, please.

134
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,202
Sweet of you to stop in.

135
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,770
There's something
you need to see.

136
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,821
I'll have it done tomorrow.

137
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,161
(Door closes)

138
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:38,703
(Computer chimes)

139
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,805
(Alarm ringing)

140
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,054
Abbott: Lisa.

141
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:59,324
- Hey.
- I'm so sorry.

142
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,760
It's okay. I saved us
a bottle of bubbles.

143
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,261
Oh! You're the best.

144
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:05,830
So how did it go?

145
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:09,834
Would you believe
I sold every damn one?

146
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,436
- No.
- (Laughs) Yes.

147
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,073
But I saved those for you.

148
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,842
I know you have a thing
for the underworld.

149
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,678
Thank you.

150
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,814
Oh, wow.

151
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,354
So all work and no play, huh?

152
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:31,890
(Sighs)

153
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:33,158
It's complicated.

154
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,695
Is everything a state secret
with you?

155
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,867
(Exclaims)

156
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,469
It's so beautiful.

157
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:36,888
(Computer beeps)

158
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:56,975
- Naomi: <i> Hello?</i>
- Hi, Naomi. It's Kate.

159
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:58,943
I'm so sorry it's so late.

160
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,513
<i>It's okay.
Is something wrong?</i>

161
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:04,783
You remember a guy
you processed a while ago,

162
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:10,121
Sri Lankan researcher
by the name of Fazli Sameer?

163
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,491
<i>Uh, yeah,</i>
<i>I was checking him out</i>
<i>when Bill pulled the file.</i>

164
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:19,798
<i>He said I had too much</i>
<i>on my plate,</i>
<i>and he'd handle it.</i>

165
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,067
Okay, all right.
Thanks so much.

166
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,402
Bye.

167
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,574
(Typing)

168
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:35,413
(Clock ticking)

169
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,346
(Sighs)

170
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,435
Actually, Dr. Balan
did ask me for a reference.

171
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,704
Request slipped
through the cracks.

172
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:15,406
I'll get my secretary
to draft one today.

173
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,848
Oh, would it be possible
to see Dr. Balan's
security clearance?

174
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,578
What's this really about?

175
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,780
-I just thought
since I was here, it'd be...
-About that.

176
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,050
If you were even
remotely familiar

177
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:28,553
with the British
defense ministry's
standards on secrecy...

178
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:30,621
We're on the same side here.

179
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,591
You need to present
a proper written authorization

180
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:37,128
from the home office
to even inquire
about security clearances.

181
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,530
- Dr. Perry, I...
- It's time for you to leave.

182
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
(Sighs)

183
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,641
Get inspector Anderson
for me, please.

184
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,544
(Doorbell ringing)

185
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,687
(Motorcycle revving)

186
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,262
(Beeping)

187
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,275
- Hey, Howie.
- Hey, sweetie. What's up?

188
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:26,344
Listen, I need the list
of this month's visa files.

189
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,478
Yeah.

190
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,053
There's no authorization.

191
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,489
Oh, Parker probably
forgot to call.

192
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,128
Could you remind him?

193
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:48,266
- Yes. Oh.
- (Cellphone rings)

194
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,134
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye-bye.

195
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,837
- You wanted to see me?
- Miss Abbott.

196
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:55,406
I believe you know
inspector Paul Anderson

197
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,407
from counter terrorism
command?

198
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,242
Good morning.

199
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,244
Why are you making inquiries
into the security status

200
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,814
of a British resident,
Dr. Emil Balan?

201
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:04,682
He applied for a visa
to come to the United States.

202
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,184
So you took it upon yourself

203
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,686
to go to his workplace
and interrogate his superior

204
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,555
rather than contacting
my office?

205
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,524
Dr. Balan needs
his visa today.

206
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:14,692
I just thought
it would be faster.

207
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,227
Not to go through
proper channels?

208
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,762
What's this about, Paul?

209
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,799
The director, Perry,
contacted me personally

210
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:26,304
to complain that Ms. Abbott
had been making
unauthorized inquiries.

211
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:30,308
Then he called his friend,
the home secretary,

212
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,744
who asked me
if you have issued the visa.

213
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,682
- No, I haven't.
- (Knock on door)

214
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,650
Is there a problem?

215
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,553
Ambassador Crane.

216
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:45,256
Inspector. Sorry I'm late.

217
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,225
I didn't know
you were joining us.

218
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:50,361
I didn't either.
The home secretary
just called.

219
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,697
So what's the problem?

220
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,537
I can't discuss the details
of an ongoing investigation.

221
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,139
We're talking about
a medical professional

222
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,207
with serious
political connections.

223
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,877
Is this really a matter
of national security?

224
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:08,713
Sam?

225
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,751
It's her call.

226
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,286
I'm standing by it.

227
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,223
I'll inform the home secretary
accordingly.

228
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,263
But let me tell you
something about Balan
that you probably don't know.

229
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:27,832
A few years ago,
his wife applied for a visa

230
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,368
for emergency
medical treatment
in the United States.

231
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,503
She died

232
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,840
because some bureaucrat
kept asking
for one more piece of paper.

233
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,510
Under the circumstances,

234
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,213
you might consider
showing her widower
a little compassion,

235
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,648
Ms. Abbott.

236
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,317
Ambassador.

237
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,891
Congratulations.

238
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,727
You're already making enemies
in high places.

239
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,496
Keep it up.

240
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:01,732
Sam, get control
of this situation.

241
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,238
Ugh.

242
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:16,881
You okay?

243
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,283
Yeah.

244
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,956
Thanks for backing me up.

245
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,224
You have great instincts,
Kate.

246
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,227
(Sighs)

247
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,868
(Indistinct chatter)

248
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,837
Bill.

249
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,772
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Sure.

250
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,911
Sorry, Kate,
I'll have to take this.

251
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,713
I'll meet you guys
at the restaurant.

252
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,648
Man 1: All right,
see you there.
Man 2: Okay. Gaston's, right?

253
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,016
See you there.

254
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,722
Man (On phone):
<i>You need to do it now.</i>

255
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:59,457
Bill: Okay, I understand.

256
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:24,915
Thanks, mate.

257
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,094
Man: After you.
Woman: Thanks.

258
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,918
Woman: I think
this is our table.
Classy. Look at that bar.

259
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,662
Woman: Naomi, have you ever...

260
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:12,984
Abbott:
This place is really nice.

261
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,100
Woman: That bar looks amazing.

262
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,770
Bill's crazy about this place.

263
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,072
What you told me last night

264
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:22,506
about Bill pulling
that file...

265
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,408
Kate, it's the guy's
birthday party.

266
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,677
We're supposed
to be having fun.

267
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,946
Oh, um, he Pre-ordered
the pressed duck
for all of us.

268
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:32,616
- Okay.
- Um, we're six, please.

269
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:35,019
Wait. Did anyone
remember to pick up
the present for Bill?

270
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:37,555
- What? That was you.
- I'm pretty sure...

271
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:39,123
Not playing a part of this.

272
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,965
- Don't look at me.
- All right, guys, pony up.

273
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,629
Naomi: Is this enough?
Joyce: I know.

274
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:47,832
It's like we're here
for the free food.

275
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,182
Hi. I'm here
to pick up a gift.

276
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:16,394
- That's beautiful.
- Yes. It's a great choice.

277
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,062
- I'll wrap it up for you.
- Thank you.

278
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,571
What's taking bill so long?

279
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,075
All right, here comes
the good part.

280
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,576
What do you mean?

281
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:34,952
Is that what we're eating?

282
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,588
That's disgusting.

283
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,426
Thank you.

284
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,161
(Cellphone beeping)

285
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,619
(Car alarms blaring)

286
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,483
Man: Help.

287
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,588
Abbott: Naomi.

288
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,226
Alvin!

289
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:56,627
Joyce!

290
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:58,996
(Grunting and panting)

291
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,046
Help.

292
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:18,148
There's someone hurt.

293
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,425
- (Gas hissing)
- (Canister explodes)

294
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,616
(Sirens blaring)

295
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,974
Abbott's still alive.

296
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,777
Where?

297
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:22,079
Following the embassy
survivor protocol.

298
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,147
<i>That's what they're
trained to do.</i>

299
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,715
Make sure she doesn't survive.

300
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,791
-Parker: What are you
hearing, Sally?
-A restaurant blew.

301
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:36,660
The place looks
like a killing zone.

302
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:41,065
According to first responders'
radio chatter, it was a bomb.

303
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:43,200
I'm working on getting
security video feeds.

304
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:45,069
- Where was the hit?
- Just a few blocks away.

305
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,303
Do we have anyone
in the area?

306
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:49,006
The visa crew took Bill
to lunch at gaston's.

307
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:50,674
Christ. Waring Lane.

308
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,355
Oh, God.

309
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,495
Parker: American embassy.
Officer: Right, sir.

310
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,336
Anderson: How long
until this is fully out?
Man: Hours.

311
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,839
Parker: How many?

312
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:27,945
Four of yours, two waiters,
saleswoman from
the glassware shop,

313
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:29,380
and five passersby.

314
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:31,215
And more than a dozen wounded.

315
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,219
The blast originated
where your people were seated.

316
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:36,720
Has anyone claimed
responsibility?

317
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,689
No.

318
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:42,292
The bomb took out most of
the security cameras
near the restaurant.

319
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,094
Don't know how much of
the feed we'll recover.

320
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:48,732
Is that all of 'em?

321
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,771
We found this in the shop.

322
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:55,893
Abbott must have been in there
when the bomb went off.

323
00:27:58,243 --> 00:27:59,410
Do you think she's dead?

324
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,280
We can't find her.

325
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,315
(Breath trembling)

326
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,065
Joyce, Robert, Alvin, Naomi,
they're all dead.

327
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:22,700
Sally: <i> Oh, my God.</i>

328
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:24,735
Bill Talbot was supposed to be
at that restaurant.

329
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:26,837
He stayed behind
to take a secure link call.

330
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:31,175
<i>He should be somewhere</i>
<i>between the embassy</i>
<i>and the restaurant.</i>

331
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:33,497
Get a lock on the trackers
on bill and Kate's ids
right now.

332
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,947
Okay. That was
the search team.

333
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:38,348
There's still
no sign of Abbott.

334
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,417
So what do we know about her?

335
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,786
Only child,
born and raised in Montana,

336
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:43,921
parents are deceased.

337
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:45,789
Stanford university.

338
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,458
Then a two-year scholarship
for graduate studies

339
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,792
at the university of London.

340
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,995
She applied
to the state department,

341
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:54,431
scored high enough to get into
the bureau
of diplomatic security.

342
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,433
She single-handedly
unraveled a plot

343
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,068
to bomb
the American embassy in...

344
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,938
Okay, so she knows the city
and she's good at her job.

345
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,039
Tell me something
I don't know.

346
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,240
Well, she's better than good.

347
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,509
London's considered
a senior posting.

348
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:07,444
She speaks four languages,

349
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,880
three of them being
Russian, Arabic, and Mandarin.

350
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:11,315
- Wait. She's CIA?
- We don't know.

351
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:17,855
Okay, until proven otherwise,
we assume abbott is alive.

352
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:19,156
<i>That makes her
a material witness</i>

353
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:21,191
<i>and quite possibly a suspect.</i>

354
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:25,162
<i>Get her details out to
the police, MI5, the media.</i>

355
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:26,830
Woman: <i>If she's
wandering around injured,</i>

356
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:28,966
<i>surely a security camera
will pick her up.</i>

357
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:30,834
Anderson: <i>No,
she'll know better than that.</i>

358
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:33,137
But put her friends,
especially that photographer,
Lisa Carr,

359
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:34,905
under surveillance.

360
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:36,440
Abbott might reach out to her.

361
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,375
I had a lock
on Kate's locator,

362
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:42,813
<i>Kate knows we're tracking
her embassy ID.</i>

363
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:45,849
She's following protocol,
heading for the safe zone
in the park.

364
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,252
<i>- Talbot's already there.</i>
- I'll be there in two minutes.

365
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:49,787
(Tires screeching)

366
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,393
(Distant sirens wailing)

367
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,369
(Indistinct)

368
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,852
- Kate.
- Bill.

369
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,590
-Thank God you're
all right. Okay?
-Okay.

370
00:30:26,592 --> 00:30:29,526
- Bill, they're all dead.
- I know, I know.

371
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:31,895
- All right, come here.
- Bill, I tried to save them.

372
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:33,497
- There's nothing left.
- Let's walk here.

373
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:36,200
- I tried to save them.
- I know. Relax.

374
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:39,937
There was a man
with a gun outside.
He almost...

375
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:41,739
Why couldn't you
have left things alone, Kate?

376
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,507
Now I have no choice.

377
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,043
(Gunshot)

378
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,614
- (Gunshot)
- (Abbott gasps)

379
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:52,282
(Bill groans)

380
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,387
Kate...

381
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:01,625
(Shuddering) Bill.

382
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:08,866
Look, look. Over there, see?

383
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,542
Woman: Danny! Come here!

384
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,349
(Crowd murmuring)

385
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:27,631
Man 1: Get away!
She's got a gun!

386
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,391
It was an accident.

387
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,901
- He tried...
- Man 2: Someone call the police!

388
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,298
(Clicks)

389
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,473
Woman: Somebody help him!

390
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,387
Someone call the police!

391
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,590
(Panting)

392
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,599
Yeah, yeah, Lancaster gate.
Yeah.

393
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,707
Excuse me.

394
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:30,714
Damn it.

395
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,490
(Women laughing)

396
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,469
Anderson: <i>Witnesses saw
Abbott holding a gun</i>

397
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,191
<i>and Talbot staggering
toward the fountain.</i>

398
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,454
And this time,
we have video evidence.

399
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:00,744
(Sighs)

400
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:03,580
Please, Paul,
give me a chance to find her.

401
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:04,862
I'm sorry, Sam.
I have my orders.

402
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,220
Look, I know
that you track your people

403
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:13,190
using GPS chips in their IDs.

404
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:14,624
It's how you knew that
Talbot and abbott were here.

405
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:15,692
Hang on a second.

406
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,401
- Where's bill's ID?
- I'm sure we'll find it.

407
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:26,470
My point is this.

408
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:29,773
Assuming abbott still has
her ID, you can find her,

409
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:31,341
and it's best I'm there
when you do.

410
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,743
(Parker sighs)

411
00:33:32,745 --> 00:33:35,178
The kid's video went viral.

412
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,147
The home secretary saw it,
got on to the foreign office.

413
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:38,749
Now she's wanted
for deadly assault

414
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:41,218
and questioning
in a terrorist incident.

415
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,421
Kate has diplomatic immunity.
You can't touch her.

416
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:46,704
You know we won't take chances
with people like that, Sam.

417
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,636
(Knock on door)

418
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:04,574
Come in.

419
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:10,814
Who are you?

420
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,717
Trevor. I work with Fred.

421
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:18,588
I only work with Fred.
Shut the door.

422
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:27,464
He's ill.
Do you want my help or not?

423
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,201
(Sighs)

424
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,676
The signal is active.
You'd better hurry.

425
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,146
What's happening
with those trackers, Sally?

426
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:44,781
Sally: <i>Someone must have
taken Bill Talbot's.</i>

427
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:46,683
<i>It's moved away from the park.</i>

428
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:49,219
At the moment, it's stationary
off Russell square.

429
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:51,288
There's still
a problem with Kate's.

430
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,557
The tracker must have got
damaged in the explosion.

431
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,358
Parker:
<i>What's the last location</i>
<i>we have for her?</i>

432
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,095
Lamb's market
off curzon street.

433
00:34:58,097 --> 00:34:59,362
And you're sure
no one else can track her?

434
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:01,198
Absolutely. Only you and me.

435
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,600
I need to get to her, Sally.

436
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,236
That's exactly what Anderson
is expecting you to do,

437
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:08,805
<i>and he'll be right behind you
with an SAS team.</i>

438
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:11,141
Kate knows what to do, Sam.

439
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:13,110
<i>It's more important
we find Talbot's tracker.</i>

440
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:14,578
<i>Whoever has it might be able
to tell us</i>

441
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,213
<i>what really happened
in that park.</i>

442
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,560
The fireworks in Dubai.

443
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,263
That was you, right?

444
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:42,806
(Beeping)

445
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:54,451
Now you can follow

446
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:55,585
whoever has one of these.

447
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,889
And the second item?

448
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:02,192
Straight from the lab
used by the security services.

449
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:03,927
Dials you into
their field agent
communication system...

450
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:05,795

451
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:06,930
(Grunts)

452
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,402
You shouldn't have asked
about Dubai.

453
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:13,703
- (Squelching)
- (Trevor groans)

454
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,179

Did you find Talbot's tracker?</i>

476
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:15,792
- No, just a dead guy.
- What?

477
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,527
Talk to me about Kate.

478
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:19,763
<i>She called in two minutes ago,</i>

479
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:21,998
hung up before
I could get a location.

480
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,633
Sam, you need
to get back here.

481
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:24,934
The ambassador's
on the warpath.

482
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,373
He must have missed abbott.

483
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:34,511
Tell the pickup teams
to stand down.

484
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:36,433
Let's see what's so
interesting about that hotel.

485
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:39,949
Abbott: What do I have
to do to convince you?

486
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:43,386
Oh, come on, please,
give me a break.

487
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,487
Just one phone call.

488
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,491
Look, it was a present.

489
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:53,396
It's Sterling, okay? Please.

490
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,766
(Sirens wailing)

491
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,541
- Local call only.
- Okay.

492
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,414
(Cellphone ringing)

493
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:14,918
Hello.

494
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,456
Lisa, please,
I need clothes and money.

495
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:21,424
<i>All right,
I'll go to your place.</i>

496
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:23,960
No, no, no.
It's not safe, um...

497
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,995
Can you just come meet me
and bring me
some of your things?

498
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:28,365
-Where?
-Somewhere where
there's a lot of people.

499
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,767
St. Pancras Station
by the Christmas market.
Two hours.

500
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,796
What's the composition
of the gas?

501
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:06,002
A precise mixture of hydrogen,
methane, and fluorine.

502
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:08,438
The volume in New York will be
four times greater.

503
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,407
So will the results.

504
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:17,847
Made to the exact
specifications necessary
to trigger this device.

505
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:23,920
I'm curious. Why not use
a detonator in New York?

506
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,091
At major events,

507
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:32,128
the police carry beeper-size
radiation detectors.

508
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,732
There's bomb-sniffing dogs,
Hazmat units.

509
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,434
(Metal clacking)

510
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:39,903
If there's any sign
of an alert,

511
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:42,639
even a false alarm,

512
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:45,141
the first thing
the authorities do
is kill all communications,

513
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:50,046
jam radio frequencies,

514
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:52,916
shut down
all cell phone towers.

515
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,922
Then we have
the counter snipers

516
00:40:58,924 --> 00:41:02,525
placed in a 500-meter radius.

517
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:06,930
However, I shall be firing
outside their perimeter.

518
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:08,865
- (Cocking rifle)
- (Man sighs)

519
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,986
(Explosions continue)

520
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,967
Soon, my friend.

521
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,507
So now there's only the girl.

522
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,711
Just make sure my shipment
gets to New York,

523
00:41:54,713 --> 00:41:55,713
that's all I ask.

524
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:01,518
(Explosions continue)

525
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:09,259
Reporter: <i> The large</i>
<i>gas explosion ripped</i>
<i>through the housing estate</i>

526
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:10,994
<i>- in tower hamlets.</i>
- Thanks.

527
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:12,262
Man: <i>What have you got for me,
Maureen?</i>

528
00:42:12,264 --> 00:42:14,597
<i>The president is
demanding answers.</i>

529
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:16,833
I just spoke with
the British home secretary.

530
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:18,801
They don't have her. Do we?

531
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:20,703
Abbott's tracker
was damaged in the blast.

532
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,639
We lost her signal
for the moment,
but even if we get it back,

533
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:24,207
the brits have snatch teams
ready to go.

534
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:26,142
If I try to make
a move on Abbott

535
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:27,844
and happen to get lucky
on her location,

536
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:29,045
I lead her right to Anderson.

537
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,014
Sam, she's a liability.

538
00:42:31,016 --> 00:42:33,216
Kate had nothing to do
with Bill's murder.

539
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:36,152
- Go ahead.
- (Clears throat)

540
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:39,222
This morning Kate took
the monthly visa list.

541
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:42,158
The flash drive contains
all of the background checks

542
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,860
and references
on the applicants.

543
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:46,863
If we find there's been
a possible terrorist breach,

544
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:48,698
that's usually
the first place we look.

545
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:52,001
- She said you'd okayed it.
- Did you?

546
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:56,806
No.

547
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,976
<i>What about the backup systems?</i>

548
00:42:59,978 --> 00:43:03,680
Five files were permanently
deleted earlier today.

549
00:43:03,682 --> 00:43:06,115
The entry log shows
that it was Abbott's ID.

550
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:08,051
It gets worse.

551
00:43:08,053 --> 00:43:10,053
We checked the security log.

552
00:43:10,055 --> 00:43:12,855
Abbott has been working
a lot of nights
when there's no one around.

553
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:15,592
It's possible
that she created documents

554
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:16,926
to get somebody
into the country,

555
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,295
and then erased the records
to cover herself.

556
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:21,230
May I remind you
that just five weeks ago,

557
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:23,099
you sent her over here
with glowing recommendations

558
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,668
because we needed the best.

559
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,237
If I recall correctly,
she was one of your protegees,

560
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:30,373
although I'm sure
you'll deny that now.

561
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:33,610
I was skeptical at first,
but it turns out
you were right.

562
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:36,946
- She's an extraordinary asset.
<i>- Yeah, just not for us.</i>

563
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,315
That's complete bullshit,

564
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:41,684
and deep in
your scared little souls
you all know it.

565
00:43:43,355 --> 00:43:49,158
And we damn sure
don't sell them out
at the first sign of trouble.

566
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,662
But most of all,
we don't forget motivation,

567
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,339
She lost some
of her best friends on 9/11.

568
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,070
Then why is she still running?

569
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,288
(Engine revving)

570
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:20,290
She's on the move.

571
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,667
(Cellphone chimes)

572
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,209
Parker: Where's Kate?

573
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:43,079
The last time we got a signal?
Leicester square,

574
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:44,681
and that was 10 minutes ago.

575
00:44:44,683 --> 00:44:46,416
It was barely registering.

576
00:44:46,418 --> 00:44:48,751
Jesus, you look how I feel.

577
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:50,353
How are you holding up?

578
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:54,991
We're monitoring
Anderson's communications.

579
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:57,260
His people are looking hard,
but in all the wrong places.

580
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:02,365
How did it go upstairs?

581
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:05,134
They want me to try
to bring in Kate,

582
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:07,103
use Anderson if I have to.

583
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,814
From Anderson's forensic lab.
Don't ask how I got it.

584
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,885
The bomb has
traces of chromium.

585
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:26,055
- We haven't seen that since...
- Paris, two years ago.

586
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:28,725
The watchmaker.

587
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:31,794
Sally: <i>Or whatever he calls
himself these days.</i>

588
00:45:31,796 --> 00:45:33,196
<i>Whoever wanted
the visa crew dead</i>

589
00:45:33,198 --> 00:45:35,298
<i>paid for the best operator
in the business.</i>

590
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:38,401
Parker: <i>He's had so much
reconstructive surgery,</i>

591
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,083
<i>no one knows
what the hell he looks like.</i>

592
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,273
(Beeping)

593
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:50,947
She's in St. Pancras station.

594
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:53,042
I'll have to take the chance.

595
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,530
And where's Abbott's friend?

596
00:46:07,532 --> 00:46:10,800
Man: <i> She just turned</i>
<i>off the euston road</i>
<i>into St. Pancras station.</i>

597
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:12,435
All right, stay with her.
I'm on my way.

598
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:39,495
Announcer: (On PA)

Suspected suicide bomber
at northeast entrance.

What's the matter?

611
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:28,371
Did you bring the money?
Did you bring it?

612
00:48:28,373 --> 00:48:30,172
Kate, you've got
to tell me something.

613
00:48:30,174 --> 00:48:32,308
Stay here. Don't move
until someone tells you to.

614
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,110
What?

615

Kate. Kate!

620
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:21,724
You had your chance
to help me, Sam.

621
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:24,627
Make sure he doesn't
follow us.

00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,188
(Gunshot)

633
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,458
(Glass shattering)

634
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:38,587
- (Abbott gasps)
- Man: Stop!

635
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:40,436
(Door slamming)

636
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:43,372
Stop!

637
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,540
(Gunshot)

638
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:45,808
Follow her!

639
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:56,519
Anderson: (Faint) Abbott!

640
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:58,721
No, this way!

641
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,696
-Man: I think she went
this way.
-Shit. Shit.

642
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:09,131
Shit!

643
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:11,734
Shit!

644
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:13,803
We can seal them off
from the street.

645
00:51:13,805 --> 00:51:16,839
What, you think she's
gonna take an officially
marked tourist exit?

646
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:18,741
There are hundreds
of other ways out of here!

647
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,278
She could be anywhere.

648
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:25,748
(Rats squeaking)

649
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,088
(Panting)

650
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,799
(Beeping)

651
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:44,667
- Abbott: What?
- (Beeping rapidly)

652
00:51:44,669 --> 00:51:45,835
(Exploding)

653
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,550
(Groans)

654
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,757
(Gasping)

655
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:10,593
(Groaning)
Jesus.

656
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,298
(Faint sirens wailing)

657
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:31,313
(Cellphone beeping)

658
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:36,585
Fucking technology.

659
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,688
Bitch.

660
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,389
(Door rattling)

661
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:27,603
- (Door rattling)
- (Abbott sighs)

662
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:08,277
(Glass shatters)

663
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:19,021
(Gasps)

664
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:28,464
Oh, come on. You know
I didn't do any of this.

665
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,275
(Beeping)

666
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,548
Gotcha.

667
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:49,018
You sure it was the same guy
you saw after
the restaurant explosion?

668
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,420
Yes, and he was in the park
after Bill tried to kill me.

669
00:54:51,422 --> 00:54:52,821
So he could have
followed you here.

670
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:00,496
We don't need anybody else
tracking you.

671
00:55:00,498 --> 00:55:02,378
Abbott: You think he's
tracked me all this time?

672
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,044
Sam, who is he?

673
00:55:15,046 --> 00:55:17,613
His code name
is the Watchmaker.

674
00:55:17,615 --> 00:55:19,748
He's one of the most wanted
assassins in the world.

675
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:21,850
You doing okay?

676
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,088
How did you know
I would come here?

677
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:28,557
I didn't.

678
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:31,493
I just came looking
for answers.

679
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:55,517
(Sighs)

680
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:08,897
What are we doing
with our lives?

681
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,901
I put everything into this.

682
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:16,905
And what am I now?
A suspect? A target?

683
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:20,008
Maybe both.

684
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,010
(Sighs)

685
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,114
(Exhales)

686
00:56:25,116 --> 00:56:27,783
We're doing this
because we believe

687
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:30,953
in that old-fashioned idea
of country, right?

688
00:56:30,955 --> 00:56:33,789
Or at least protecting
our fellow citizens.

689
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,925
Our friends.

690
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:38,767
Right now, I'm doing it
to protect my own hide.

691
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:41,563
That's good thinking.

692
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:46,468
What's that?

693
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:49,471
It's the flash drive
I got from Howie.

694
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:54,143
Last month we processed
over 600 visa applications,

695
00:56:54,145 --> 00:56:56,845
and Bill personally intervened
in five of those cases,

696
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:57,980
including Balan's.

697
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:00,716
Now for each applicant

698
00:57:00,718 --> 00:57:02,651
he used a different member
of the visa team,

699
00:57:02,653 --> 00:57:04,453
and when I started
asking questions,

700
00:57:04,455 --> 00:57:06,588
he ignored me,
slammed them through.

701
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,891
So what's the connection
between the applicants?

702
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:12,094
I don't know yet.

703
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:14,596
But we do know balan is an
expert in combustible gases.

704
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,601
Maybe bill had the answer.

705
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:23,906
Bill said something strange
in the park.

706
00:57:23,908 --> 00:57:26,642
"Now I have no choice."

707
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:28,877
He must have kept
some information
about the people he let in.

708
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:30,979
A little leverage,
in case he needed it.

709
00:57:30,981 --> 00:57:32,881
Who puts a padlock
on a bedroom door?

710
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:37,920
(Gun cocking)

711
00:57:37,922 --> 00:57:39,121
(Gunshot)

712
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:55,003
Hello, my lovely.

713
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,011
Abbott: God.

714
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:09,051
- Is this Bill's son?
- Yeah.

715
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:13,655
Johnny died in Afghanistan.

716
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:19,061
Something about this
just doesn't add up.

717
00:58:19,063 --> 00:58:21,096
It's like bill was expecting
him to walk through the door
at any minute.

718
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:22,164
(Sighs)

719
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,267
Take it apart.

720
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:27,503
Everything.

721
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,200
Parker: Look at this.

722
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:13,282
Johnny: (On TV)
<i>Hi, dad. I'm doing okay.</i>

723
00:59:13,284 --> 00:59:15,217
<i>Hope you are, too.</i>

724
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,954
<i>It'll be Christmas soon.</i>

725
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:20,289
<i>Wish we could be together.</i>

726
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:24,626
Johnny's been alive
all this time.

727
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:27,162
Do you think
there's a chance?

728
00:59:27,164 --> 00:59:28,324
I doubt it. Look at his eyes.

729
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:31,033
He's swimming in dope.

730
00:59:31,035 --> 00:59:34,002
Someone kept him alive
for as long as possible
to get this footage.

731
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:39,308
But how did they know
it was Bill's son,
or who Bill was?

732
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:41,710
They must have someone
with access to army records.

733
00:59:41,712 --> 00:59:43,045
Doesn't have to be
a major player.

734
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:45,681
A guy inputting data
could be enough.

735
00:59:45,683 --> 00:59:47,182
Once they knew it was Bill,
they threatened
to kill his son

736
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:48,817
if he didn't give them
what they wanted.

737
00:59:48,819 --> 00:59:50,819
Which makes Bill's actions
understandable.

738
00:59:50,821 --> 00:59:52,354
But not excusable,

739
00:59:52,356 --> 00:59:54,256
because once Bill got
his people into the states,

740
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:56,124
it was only a matter of time
before he eliminated

741
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:58,226
everyone who handled
the paperwork.

742
00:59:58,228 --> 01:00:01,229
Then he got the bastard
who murdered them
to come after me.

743
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:04,166
The watchmaker would
never deal with
low-level guys like Bill.

744
01:00:04,168 --> 01:00:06,668
His business is with
whoever had Bill's son.

745
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:11,373
You said there were
four others besides Balan?

746
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:14,142
Yeah, and every single one
of them is in America.

747
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:19,381
(Cellphone beeps)

748
01:00:19,383 --> 01:00:22,217
(Line ringing)

749
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:24,086
We need to move now.
I'll get Archer to meet us
out front.

750
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:26,054
(Ringing)

751
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,158
- (Line ringing)
- (Exhales)

752
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,294
Come on, come on, come on.

753
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:39,701
What's wrong?

754
01:00:39,703 --> 01:00:40,903
Let's get the hell
out of here.

755
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:49,077
- Sam?
- (Groaning)

756
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:50,178
(Footsteps approaching)

757
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,192
Watchmaker: Kate.

758
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:12,834
Kate.

759
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:17,806
(Gasping)

760
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:47,869
(Siren wailing)

761
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:06,755
(Bell dings)

762
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:17,499
- (Siren wailing)
- (Line ringing)

763
01:02:17,501 --> 01:02:19,468
(Ringing)

764
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:22,137
- Sally.
- Kate?

765
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:24,873
- Is Sam still alive?
<i>- Barely.</i>

766
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:27,509
<i>He's pretty badly hurt, Kate.</i>

767
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,180
Hold on.
Anderson's on the scene.

768
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:34,783
He's coming on the line
with Crane.

769
01:02:34,785 --> 01:02:37,986
Madam ambassador,
I'm at Bill Talbot's
apartment.

770
01:02:37,988 --> 01:02:39,888
Sam Parker's been
critically injured.

771
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:41,490
Jesus.

772
01:02:41,492 --> 01:02:43,391
Witnesses saw abbott
running from the scene,

773
01:02:43,393 --> 01:02:45,827
and we found her embassy ID.

774
01:02:45,829 --> 01:02:47,829
Crane: <i>Where is she now?</i>
Anderson: <i> We don't know.</i>

775
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,366
If you get her in your sights,
do not hesitate.

776
01:02:51,368 --> 01:02:52,434
Do you understand?

777
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:54,770
Yes, I do.

778
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:58,306
The longer she lives,
the more people die.

779
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:00,509
Kate.

780
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:04,813
- I'm here.
- I'm so sorry.

781
01:03:04,815 --> 01:03:06,081
<i>They think you tried
to kill him.</i>

782
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:07,215
What?

783
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:09,484
That's insane.

784
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:14,055
I need to get into
the embassy. To the vault.

785
01:03:14,057 --> 01:03:15,957
<i>The building's
on total lockdown.</i>

786
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:17,926
- There's no other way.
<i>- Kate, listen to me.</i>

787
01:03:17,928 --> 01:03:19,861
<i>The place is crawling
with marines.</i>

788
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:21,797
You know I'm innocent.

789
01:03:21,799 --> 01:03:24,266
And I know I'm right
about this plot.

790
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:25,834
You have to get me in, Sally.

791
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,879
(Indistinct radio chatter)

792
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:45,887
(Keypad beeping)

-I'm buzzing you in now.

795
01:03:57,367 --> 01:04:01,903
I'm shutting down the cameras
in the stairwell
and the vault.

796
01:04:01,905 --> 01:04:03,305
In and out,

Abbott: <i>There's a terrorist
headed for the states.</i>

807
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:16,211
Emil Balan. He's traveling
on a Romanian passport.

808
01:05:16,213 --> 01:05:20,115
Oceanic Airlines, flight 428,
out of Heathrow to JFK.

809
01:05:20,117 --> 01:05:21,383
They have to stop him, Sally.

01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:53,715
<i>The name she used,
the passport number,</i>

<i>they're gone.
She could be anyone.</i>

814
01:05:55,419 --> 01:05:57,052
Get Abbott's picture
to security

815
01:05:57,054 --> 01:05:59,521
at all London airports
and train stations.

816
01:05:59,523 --> 01:06:00,622
Yes, yes, yes, what is it?

817
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:18,239
The purpose of your visit,
doctor?

818
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:20,408
Medical conference.

819
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:22,477
There's still time
to stop Balan,
Madam Ambassador,

820
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,446
if you act now.

821
01:06:24,448 --> 01:06:27,549
No. Don't you see
what Abbott's doing?

822
01:06:27,551 --> 01:06:30,452
She is trying to get us
to chase a shadow
instead of her.

823
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:32,721
(Sighs)

824
01:06:32,723 --> 01:06:34,990
(Indistinct chatter on pa)

825
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,656
You're supposed to have left
for New York.

826
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,551
I'm not sure I'm going.

827
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:09,691
What the hell are you
talking about?

828
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:16,464
I found your reaction
to that little explosion
quite instructive.

829
01:07:16,466 --> 01:07:20,101
The way your eyes lit up,
the greed I saw in them.

830
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:25,607
Fortunes are made when
there's blood on the streets,

831
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:27,342
and very soon there's gonna be
a great deal of blood

832
01:07:27,344 --> 01:07:29,644
on the streets of New York,
won't there?

833
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:32,047
Just as there was after 9/11.

834
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:37,786
However, when the New York
exchanges reopened,

835
01:07:37,788 --> 01:07:40,722
people who bet against
the market
made a fortune.

836
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:47,662
This isn't an act of terror
or a bold political statement.

837
01:07:47,664 --> 01:07:50,398
Balan may wish to avenge
his wife's death,

838
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,233
but for you,

839
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:55,603
it's just about making money.

840
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,673
$100 billion is in play.

841
01:07:58,675 --> 01:08:01,476
I would say the word "just"
doesn't quite fit.

842
01:08:01,478 --> 01:08:03,812
If I stay home,
you won't make a penny.

843
01:08:03,814 --> 01:08:07,148
- What do you want?
- Half.

844
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:10,585
Half of your
short-selling profits
on the New York exchanges

845
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:12,520
the day they reopen for trade.

846
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:14,689
Simple.

847
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:18,760
Is the girl dead?

848
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:26,768
Very.

Is everything all right,
ma'am?

864
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,500
Death in the family.

Now this is taking too long.

868
01:10:27,958 --> 01:10:30,391
I'm doing the best I can,
Madam Ambassador.

869
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:46,441
Excuse me, ma'am.
You'll have to shut that down
for landing.

870
01:10:46,443 --> 01:10:47,775
Okay.

871
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:11,833
- Ma'am.

(Whispers)
Gonna get us both killed.

875
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:11,392
It doesn't make sense.
Why Paris?

876
01:12:11,394 --> 01:12:13,828
Abbott has no history there,
no friends to help her.

877
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:18,733
And why risk flying? It's
safer to take the Eurostar.

- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

881

and a serious threat.</i>

- Understood, madam ambassador.

Us passport number 212683550.

coming off USS827.

888

Real name, Katherine Abbott.
Photo's on the way.

889
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:11,586
Jamieson, let's get
the details to immigration.

-Miller, let's alert customs

-Yes, ma'am.

Stay alert, people.

894
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:38,980
Officer: Careful, ma'am.
You're in New York now.

895
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,550
Taxi, madam?

896
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:45,953
You're a gypsy, right?

897
01:13:45,955 --> 01:13:48,890
Madam,
I'm an independent contractor
with 14 years' experience.

898
01:13:48,892 --> 01:13:51,125
Okay. No medallion?
No radio either?

899
01:13:51,127 --> 01:13:52,927
Please, I want no trouble
with the police.

900
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:54,996
That makes two of us.

901
01:13:54,998 --> 01:13:56,898
500 bucks for the night.

902
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,933
In cash, plus gas.

903
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:01,002
- It's new year's Eve.
- Okay. Let's go.

904
01:14:01,004 --> 01:14:02,637
I have an address
in lower Manhattan.

905
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:13,881
Balan: Red, increase 3%.

906
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:17,151
Green, maintain present level.

907
01:14:17,153 --> 01:14:19,120
Yellow, reduce 1%.

908
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:23,090
Bit too slow,
but maintain levels.

909

(Alarm ringing)

911
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:31,899
And stop.

912
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:35,570
Lock the cylinders.

913
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:43,778
Don't worry about
the tanks or equipment,

914
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,420
but make sure you pack up
everything else.

915
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:48,149
I'm going to look after
the loading.

916
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:58,559
Take the BQE
to the Brooklyn bridge.

917

(Abbott grunting)

950
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:23,818
Man: Ahh!

951
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:43,370
(Man screams)

952
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:45,940
(Gun cocking)

953
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:40,194
(Car honking)

954
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:44,431
Abbott: No. No.

955
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:48,302
(Buzzer ringing)

956
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:56,410
Hurry.

957
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:00,648
Come on.

958
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:06,987
Can I help you, ma'am?

959
01:22:06,989 --> 01:22:08,355
The guys that just came in,
where'd they go?

960
01:22:08,357 --> 01:22:09,990
Uh, 1501.

961
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:20,935
Man: Help! I need the cops.
Someone call 911.

962
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:41,155
We have to go. We have
less than five minutes.

963
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:55,135
(Gunshots)

(Faint cheering)

967
01:23:57,632 --> 01:24:00,367
You just had to be here.

968
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:03,203
I've been waiting 10 years
for this moment,

969
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:05,472
to see the Americans pay
for what they have done.

970
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:13,247
How far will
the explosion travel?

971
01:24:13,249 --> 01:24:14,448
Not this far.

972
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:16,116
Good.

973
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:46,146

- Ahh!

977
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:08,836
No.

978
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:13,140
Bitch! Come on.

979
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:15,509
Come on.

980
01:25:15,511 --> 01:25:17,678
(Both grunting)

981
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:21,415
Fuck you.

982
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,567
Kate...

983
01:25:46,608 --> 01:25:50,144
Crowd: (Chanting)
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

984

six, five,

985
01:25:52,581 --> 01:25:56,316
four, three, two, one.

986
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:57,518
Abbott: Time's up.

987
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,000
- (Screaming)
- Crowd: Happy new year!

988
01:26:05,226 --> 01:26:07,261
(Fireworks exploding)

989
01:26:08,363 --> 01:26:10,831
(Crowd cheering wildly)

990
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:21,175
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

991
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:37,591
Man: Abbott.

992
01:26:38,626 --> 01:26:40,294
Abbott, it's for you.

993
01:26:46,467 --> 01:26:47,601
Hello?

994
01:26:49,304 --> 01:26:51,205
-I always liked
your instincts.
<i>-Oh, Sam.</i>

995
01:26:56,477 --> 01:26:58,278
You're alive.

996
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,547
Yeah. You, too,
from what I hear.

997
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:01,782
(Laughs)
<i>Mostly.</i>

998
01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:06,853
So I guess this is what
we're doing with our lives.

999
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:12,693
Yeah, it is.

1000
01:27:12,695 --> 01:27:15,662
<i>Kate, there were</i>
<i>over a million people</i>
<i>out there tonight,</i>

1001
01:27:16,798 --> 01:27:18,732
<i>and you saved them all.</i>
