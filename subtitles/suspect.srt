3
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,031
-Miss Quinn.
-Justice Lowell.

4
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:54,263
-I hope you haven't been waiting long.
-Oh, no, sir.

5
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,020
Please come in.

6
00:02:01,178 --> 00:02:04,407
-Do you have plans for the holidays?
-I'm staying in the city...

7
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:06,580
...spending Christmas with some friends.

8
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:08,916
I never know what to get people.

9
00:02:09,404 --> 00:02:11,346
My wife would buy our gifts.

10
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:14,426
She always seemed to get
just the right thing.

11
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,601
I hope this is appropriate. Use it well.

12
00:02:25,118 --> 00:02:27,125
Thank you, Mr. Justice. I will.

13
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:30,393
-Have a good Christmas.
-And you, too.

14
00:02:50,883 --> 00:02:56,066
-Would you like your car brought around?
-Not just yet. I want to clear my desk.

15
00:02:56,164 --> 00:03:00,834
You know, Abraham Lincoln used
to hunt wild turkey down our roads.

16
00:03:01,285 --> 00:03:04,067
You can still bag one there
for Christmas dinner.

17
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:10,822
Okay, polar bears! Let's go!

18
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:25,869
Come on, Mike. It's not that cold.

19
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:16,698
Bill, we've got something here.

20
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,566
Hey! Up here!

21
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:19,742
<i>And now, back to our main story.</i>

22
00:06:19,816 --> 00:06:23,428
<i>Justice Lowell is said to have been</i>
<i>despondent over failing health.</i>

23
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:27,620
<i>This morning at a memorial service</i>
<i>at Washington Cathedral...</i>

24
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:31,104
<i>...the President called the Justice</i>
<i>''one of our finest jurists.</i>

25
00:06:31,178 --> 00:06:34,080
<i>''A man dedicated to law</i>
<i>and devoted to truth.''</i>

26
00:06:34,378 --> 00:06:38,208
<i>Funeral services will be held</i>
<i>this afternoon at Arlington Cemetery.</i>

27
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,243
That was my mother's!

28
00:07:15,922 --> 00:07:17,296
What is she doing?

29
00:07:17,362 --> 00:07:19,053
Out of the way, man!

30
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:45,011
From Your Honor's lockup list, number 15...

31
00:07:45,142 --> 00:07:47,630
...the United States versus Daniel Adams.

32
00:07:47,863 --> 00:07:50,230
Mr. Adams, you are being charged with....

33
00:07:50,296 --> 00:07:52,368
-Hi, Jack.
-Hi, Kath.

34
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:55,030
-Did you get my message?
-Yeah. You okay?

35
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:56,438
I'm fine.

36
00:07:56,568 --> 00:08:00,659
Get him to take a recess for a few weeks.
We'll blow smoke up his judicial ass.

37
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:02,452
Did I miss anything?

38
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:04,721
Your assault with intent skipped.

39
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:07,192
What a surprise. He promised he wouldn't.

40
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,936
I have a feeling we might see him in March
with a nice Florida tan.

41
00:08:11,003 --> 00:08:12,791
Here's today's top 40.

42
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:15,476
Busy night.

43
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,158
A hundred and two felony arrests.
Some kind of a record for a Monday.

44
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,293
I don't know what it is.
It's like something in the air.

45
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,184
The Christmas spirit.

46
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:27,064
Get Carl Wayne Anderson.

47
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,812
Next on Your Honor's lockup list
is number 17...

48
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,747
...United States versus
Carl Wayne Anderson.

49
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:46,426
Is Mr. Anderson's attorney present?

50
00:08:46,497 --> 00:08:49,726
Your Honor, Mr. Anderson has refused
to speak with an attorney.

51
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:52,314
He has refused to speak with anyone at all.

52
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:57,564
You are accused of first-degree murder.
Do you understand that, Mr. Anderson?

53
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,406
Do you know where you are,
Mr. Anderson?

54
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:12,291
As I am unable to determine
whether Mr. Anderson is competent...

55
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:16,865
...I will postpone presentment
pending psychiatric evaluation.

56
00:09:17,351 --> 00:09:19,685
Does Mr. Anderson have means of support?

57
00:09:19,751 --> 00:09:21,638
He's indigent, Your Honor.

58
00:09:21,864 --> 00:09:24,963
The court, then, will appoint new counsel.

59
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:27,910
Let the record show that Miss Riley...

60
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:31,358
...with the public defender's office
will represent Mr. Anderson.

61
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:34,816
Your Honor, I'm due for a vacation.
I haven't had one in a year.

62
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,687
Miss Riley, please accompany
Mr. Anderson and interview him.

63
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:41,282
Yes, Your Honor.

64
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,812
We'll pass this case. What's next?

65
00:09:43,915 --> 00:09:47,363
Mr. Anderson, I am Kathleen Riley
from the public defender's office.

66
00:09:47,437 --> 00:09:50,187
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

67
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:52,905
You're being charged with murder.

68
00:09:54,606 --> 00:09:58,862
Could you tell me where you were
around midnight, December 18?

69
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,430
Mr. Anderson, where were you at midnight,
December 18?

70
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:17,612
I'm your lawyer.
Anything you tell me is confidential.

71
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:25,001
If you don't talk to me, I can't help you.

72
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:31,249
I guess this is a waste of time.

73
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:41,486
Do you understand
what's happening to you?

74
00:10:46,903 --> 00:10:49,685
Jim, you want to let me out of here?

75
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:36,278
Can't they read?

76
00:14:08,378 --> 00:14:09,938
Don't you own a watch?

77
00:14:10,554 --> 00:14:12,114
We're in trouble.

78
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:14,960
We're in deep shit.

79
00:14:15,227 --> 00:14:17,114
Support's drying up
quicker than an old whore.

80
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,798
-It's too close to call.
-Did Comisky declare?

81
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,551
She's on the fence.
They're waiting to see where she falls.

82
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,562
-Did she go in?
-Yeah.

83
00:14:38,655 --> 00:14:40,859
Congressman Newton! Good to see you.

84
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:43,836
And the whip?
He said he'd keep his people in line.

85
00:14:43,904 --> 00:14:46,970
He said he'd never turn his back
on the American farmer.

86
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:50,424
What else is new? He got a sudden
backache. He's sitting out the vote.

87
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:53,083
He told his side of the aisle
to vote their conscience.

88
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:54,778
That'd be a first.

89
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,921
What do you think, Grace?

90
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:12,036
I can't help you, Eddie.

91
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:15,236
I just wanted to see
which way the wind was blowing.

92
00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:16,445
That's it?

93
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:19,006
I respect you, Grace.
I'm not going to insult you...

94
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,209
...with a promise out of left field.
You have to vote your conscience.

95
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:25,694
When you get humble, I get nervous.
I feel like I'm being set up.

96
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,522
Nothin' up my sleeve.

97
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,433
You did what you could.
I'm in a tight spot.

98
00:15:30,536 --> 00:15:33,536
My district's blue collar.
They don't like government subsidies.

99
00:15:33,608 --> 00:15:35,266
I'm on their side, Grace.

100
00:15:35,337 --> 00:15:38,337
I come from a farm family myself,
of dirty collars.

101
00:15:38,442 --> 00:15:41,442
But everyone wants milk on the table.
If the price isn't right...

102
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:45,256
...the dairy farmers will dump it
in the river. It's a terrible waste.

103
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:47,786
Grace?

104
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,535
When you were in trouble...

105
00:15:50,604 --> 00:15:54,248
...and needed the crop states' support
on the car company bailout...

106
00:15:54,348 --> 00:15:56,235
...I ran up the flag for you.

107
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,187
I pulled a lot of votes.

108
00:15:59,277 --> 00:16:00,935
That's life, Eddie.

109
00:16:02,638 --> 00:16:06,795
No, Grace, that's politics. Life's
what everybody else does, remember?

110
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Your district has a big
inner-city lunch program, right?

111
00:16:14,672 --> 00:16:15,500
Yes.

112
00:16:15,568 --> 00:16:18,186
What if we donated
a year's worth of free milk.

113
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:20,679
No point in it going down the river.

114
00:16:20,753 --> 00:16:24,747
I don't believe that you're trying
to bribe me with milk for babies.

115
00:16:26,546 --> 00:16:31,216
It's a good bill. Just give me some time
to shore up some support.

116
00:16:32,243 --> 00:16:35,210
Have the vote postponed
till after the holidays.

117
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:38,413
Why did you wait so long to come to me?

118
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:41,709
It slipped my mind.

119
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,090
Nothing slips your mind.
''Life's what everybody else does.''

120
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:48,782
You're dangerous.

121
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:54,188
I'll get it postponed, but that squares us.

122
00:16:54,295 --> 00:16:57,873
Don't ask me for my vote. It's not for sale.

123
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:35,416
-What happened?
-He hit an officer last night.

124
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:39,447
I'd like to put his eye out. That's the
third time it's happened in two months.

125
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:43,446
Keep goin' like this he goin' to wake up
one mornin' and find hisself hung.

126
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:46,900
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.
Did a doctor see him?

127
00:17:46,976 --> 00:17:50,009
Yeah. He came and went.
He wouldn't let him touch him.

128
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,519
Take the cuffs off.

129
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:53,178
Chief told me not to.

130
00:17:53,249 --> 00:17:56,184
Just take the cuffs off. I'll be responsible.

131
00:17:56,386 --> 00:17:59,233
All right. You wearin' the suit.

132
00:18:06,116 --> 00:18:10,557
-They put animals to sleep, you know.
-They miss some sometimes, don't they?

133
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:15,138
Are you trying to commit suicide?
Just tell me if you are...

134
00:18:15,205 --> 00:18:18,817
...because if you are,
I've got better things to do with my time.

135
00:18:33,896 --> 00:18:35,619
Oh, Jesus.

136
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,737
Get a doctor.

137
00:18:56,428 --> 00:19:00,006
I couldn't read your writing in some places.

138
00:19:01,902 --> 00:19:06,125
I got most of it but I have to ask you
some more questions.

139
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:08,327
Carl?

140
00:20:09,337 --> 00:20:10,646
Carl?

141
00:20:11,449 --> 00:20:12,397
Carl!

142
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,970
Have you told me everything?

143
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,458
Have you told me everything?

144
00:20:25,212 --> 00:20:26,903
A piece of cake.

145
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:31,672
Maybe it won't bother a jury that
your fingerprints were all over her body.

146
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:34,676
Possibly, they won't mind
that you carried a big knife.

147
00:20:34,749 --> 00:20:36,342
They'll probably understand.

148
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:38,868
She was dead anyway.
What the hell? Why not rob her?

149
00:20:38,974 --> 00:20:42,651
And maybe I'll play quarterback
for the Redskins next season.

150
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:46,196
Tell me that you did it.

151
00:20:46,271 --> 00:20:50,581
I'll go to the judge and ask for mercy.
It'll save us both a lot of headache.

152
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:35,267
''Michael was there...

153
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:39,108
''...before me.''

154
00:21:44,106 --> 00:21:45,993
Michael? Michael who?

155
00:22:05,902 --> 00:22:07,363
And eyes.

156
00:22:07,438 --> 00:22:08,932
What color were his eyes?

157
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:10,854
Brown.

158
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:14,093
And his hair? His hair.

159
00:22:20,112 --> 00:22:21,322
Dark hair.

160
00:22:21,392 --> 00:22:23,531
And how tall was Michael?

161
00:22:29,361 --> 00:22:30,768
Medium.

162
00:22:51,957 --> 00:22:54,739
He had a tattoo on his hand?

163
00:22:56,054 --> 00:22:59,316
Is there anything more?
Is there anything more about Michael?

164
00:22:59,991 --> 00:23:01,747
Can you remember anything more?

165
00:23:08,984 --> 00:23:11,504
The doctor's here. Come on.

166
00:23:38,878 --> 00:23:41,845
-Good evening, Louis, Ansel.
-Matthew.

167
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:45,528
I hear you're up for an appointment
to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.

168
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:48,599
-I've heard those rumors.
-Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

169
00:23:48,703 --> 00:23:50,612
They're more than rumors.

170
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,755
When's the announcement?

171
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:57,661
The President should make
his choice known by the end of the month.

172
00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:59,038
That reminds me.

173
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:02,881
I'm scheduled to hear the Winslow trial.
It's got to drag on into spring.

174
00:24:02,946 --> 00:24:05,881
I was wondering if you'd consider
making a change.

175
00:24:05,955 --> 00:24:09,752
I'd like to clear my docket
in case the appointment comes through.

176
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,971
You're scheduled for...

177
00:24:13,348 --> 00:24:15,715
...''United States versus Anderson.''

178
00:24:15,972 --> 00:24:18,655
It looks pro forma.
Two weeks at the outside.

179
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:20,764
It'd make my life a lot simpler.

180
00:24:20,837 --> 00:24:25,180
As a lifelong Democrat, I should do
all that I can to delay your appointment.

181
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:28,765
But in the spirit of bipartisanship
and future considerations...

182
00:24:28,838 --> 00:24:30,660
...I'm okay with a change.

183
00:24:30,727 --> 00:24:35,299
Excuse me, gentlemen, my prostate's shot.
Sitting on my ass too many years.

184
00:24:42,953 --> 00:24:44,197
Want a ride?

185
00:24:44,297 --> 00:24:45,606
No, thanks.

186
00:24:46,858 --> 00:24:48,003
Morty?

187
00:24:50,378 --> 00:24:53,858
I need some investigative help.
I can't do this one all by myself.

188
00:24:53,931 --> 00:24:56,614
We're short right now.
The interns have their finals.

189
00:24:56,683 --> 00:24:59,017
I know, but I've got to find
a material witness.

190
00:24:59,084 --> 00:25:02,051
Is this witness hard
or a figment of your client's imagination?

191
00:25:02,124 --> 00:25:03,531
I don't know.

192
00:25:04,204 --> 00:25:06,757
-You want a beer?
-Yeah, please.

193
00:25:07,822 --> 00:25:09,480
Can you live without him?

194
00:25:09,582 --> 00:25:12,265
I can live without him fine. My client can't.

195
00:25:12,462 --> 00:25:16,718
I'll see if I can find you
a private investigator somewhere.

196
00:25:18,671 --> 00:25:22,949
-What if your witness doesn't materialize?
-Then it's your basic dog-and-pony show.

197
00:25:23,024 --> 00:25:26,188
Circumstantial evidence. Reasonable
doubt. We'll be dead in a week.

198
00:25:26,257 --> 00:25:29,737
-Who's prosecuting?
-Some guy named Charlie Stella.

199
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:33,098
He just came on.
He's real hot shit in Baltimore.

200
00:25:33,202 --> 00:25:36,071
He wants to be a senator
after he's president.

201
00:25:37,395 --> 00:25:40,046
Listen, Kath. Prosecution owes me a few.

202
00:25:40,243 --> 00:25:42,512
How about going to the table
with this one?

203
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:44,968
Maybe plea-bargaining
and cutting your losses.

204
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,183
My client has nothing to lose.

205
00:25:51,445 --> 00:25:53,998
''Motion to dismiss
for failure to Mirandize...

206
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:57,386
''...for illegal search and seizure,
and for insufficient evidence.''

207
00:25:57,494 --> 00:25:59,828
It's a waste of paper.

208
00:26:04,215 --> 00:26:07,314
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
I don't have a life.

209
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,830
The last movie I went to was a year ago.
The only time I listen to music is in my car.

210
00:26:11,928 --> 00:26:13,105
I don't date.

211
00:26:13,176 --> 00:26:17,486
I'd like to have a child but I don't even
have a boyfriend. How can I have a child?

212
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:20,528
I spend all my time
with murderers and rapists.

213
00:26:21,307 --> 00:26:23,729
What's really crazy is that I like them.

214
00:26:23,898 --> 00:26:25,938
It grows on you.

215
00:26:28,572 --> 00:26:31,539
I don't think I can do it anymore. I'm tired.

216
00:26:32,028 --> 00:26:33,850
I'm really tired.

217
00:26:35,037 --> 00:26:37,787
I'm even thinking about
going into private practice.

218
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:40,242
If I'm gonna go crazy,
I might as well get paid for it.

219
00:26:40,317 --> 00:26:43,186
You have stayed around
a lot longer than most.

220
00:26:44,158 --> 00:26:45,849
Why do you stay?

221
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:48,892
I don't know.

222
00:26:49,727 --> 00:26:51,898
Same thing as you, I guess.

223
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,022
For the sake of the one poor bastard
who didn't do it.

224
00:26:56,481 --> 00:27:00,759
-Plus, I look a bit fat in a three-piece suit.
-You? Never.

225
00:27:01,217 --> 00:27:03,705
-You coming?
-No, I have to finish.

226
00:27:03,777 --> 00:27:06,460
All righty. Thanks for the beer.

227
00:27:22,597 --> 00:27:24,833
Excuse me.
Where do I report for jury duty?

228
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,275
Third floor.

229
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:30,205
-I need to be excused. Who do I talk to?
-Jurors' Excuse Officer.

230
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:33,147
Everybody's got a title.
What's a good excuse?

231
00:27:33,223 --> 00:27:36,190
-You ever been called before?
-Yeah, last year. I was too busy.

232
00:27:36,296 --> 00:27:39,143
The second time you're called,
you gotta serve. It's the law.

233
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:41,696
I'm sure something can be worked out.

234
00:27:43,048 --> 00:27:44,990
I don't like your chances.

235
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:11,010
Dennis Kirkham?

236
00:28:11,181 --> 00:28:12,228
Here.

237
00:28:13,134 --> 00:28:14,595
Kathryn Conrad?

238
00:28:15,054 --> 00:28:16,068
Here.

239
00:28:16,142 --> 00:28:19,371
Miss? Attorney.
I'm Everett Bennett, private investigator.

240
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:21,195
You're looking for someone?

241
00:28:21,295 --> 00:28:22,243
You.

242
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:25,387
Either be seated in the gallery
or leave now.

243
00:28:26,512 --> 00:28:28,683
This isn't a bus station, Miss Riley.

244
00:28:28,753 --> 00:28:30,182
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

245
00:28:30,257 --> 00:28:31,664
Lee Ron Davis?

246
00:28:31,825 --> 00:28:32,872
Here.

247
00:28:33,554 --> 00:28:34,830
Shelley Boylen?

248
00:28:34,898 --> 00:28:35,880
Here.

249
00:28:35,986 --> 00:28:37,327
Doris McCloud?

250
00:28:37,394 --> 00:28:37,993
Here.

251
00:28:42,483 --> 00:28:47,273
Ladies and gentlemen. As the defendant
has a hearing and speech impairment...

252
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:51,603
...and is unable to read signing, the court
has provided him with assistance.

253
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:57,738
If you are seated as a juror, you'll be asked
to disregard this disability...

254
00:28:57,846 --> 00:29:01,905
...unless it is shown to have
a direct bearing on the case.

255
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:05,486
Mr. Stella, whenever you're ready.

256
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:07,250
Thank you, Your Honor.

257
00:29:08,376 --> 00:29:10,034
Good morning.

258
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,546
I'm Charlie Stella,
an assistant United States attorney.

259
00:29:15,608 --> 00:29:19,220
I'll be asking questions
about your backgrounds and experiences...

260
00:29:19,321 --> 00:29:23,860
...which may reflect on your ability
to sit as fair and impartial jurors.

261
00:29:26,043 --> 00:29:28,563
Mr. Davis, as a loan officer...

262
00:29:28,635 --> 00:29:31,930
...is it one of your responsibilities
to handle foreclosures?

263
00:29:32,156 --> 00:29:33,847
It's part of my job.

264
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:36,728
How do you feel about that part
of your job?

265
00:29:36,796 --> 00:29:39,829
It must be difficult
putting people out of their homes.

266
00:29:40,093 --> 00:29:44,632
It doesn't trouble me. A person should
be responsible for his debts.

267
00:29:45,598 --> 00:29:49,144
Thank you very much for coming,
Mr. Davis. You're excused.

268
00:29:55,808 --> 00:29:59,485
And what are your feelings
about capital punishment, Mr. Sanger?

269
00:29:59,553 --> 00:30:01,047
Objection, Your Honor.

270
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:04,831
Mr. Stella knows capital punishment
isn't an option in the District of Columbia.

271
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,029
I'm sure Mr. Sanger has
a thoughtful opinion, but it isn't germane.

272
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,520
I'll determine what's germane, Miss Riley.

273
00:30:10,627 --> 00:30:12,088
It's misleading, Your Honor.

274
00:30:12,162 --> 00:30:16,188
My client is not facing the death penalty,
nor has he been convicted of any crime.

275
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:18,201
We resent the implication.

276
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:22,301
Don't bring a rope
unless you intend to use it, Counselor.

277
00:30:22,372 --> 00:30:25,852
Would Your Honor please instruct
the prospective jurors?

278
00:30:27,366 --> 00:30:30,682
The death penalty is not an option
in the District of Columbia...

279
00:30:30,758 --> 00:30:33,791
...although some of us feel it should be.

280
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:37,282
We thank Your Honor for his consideration.

281
00:30:40,328 --> 00:30:42,717
Will you please answer, Mr. Sanger?

282
00:30:43,016 --> 00:30:45,471
I think the punishment should fit the crime.

283
00:30:45,545 --> 00:30:47,333
Thank you, Mr. Sanger.

284
00:30:48,777 --> 00:30:50,686
Good morning, Mr. Sanger.

285
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:55,424
Mr. Sanger, you've stated
that you are a congressional advisor.

286
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,213
Is that another word for lobbyist?

287
00:31:00,171 --> 00:31:05,157
I don't know. That's sort of like
calling a lawyer a mouthpiece, isn't it?

288
00:31:05,836 --> 00:31:08,487
Who are you congressional advisor for?

289
00:31:09,037 --> 00:31:12,386
Agribusiness, mostly.
The United Milk Producers.

290
00:31:12,749 --> 00:31:15,749
Now, the lobbyists that I've known
are very persuasive people.

291
00:31:16,494 --> 00:31:18,828
They could sell you just about anything.

292
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,475
It's sort of un-American not to like milk.

293
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:23,373
I'm allergic to milk.

294
00:31:23,439 --> 00:31:24,715
I'm sorry.

295
00:31:25,776 --> 00:31:27,915
Mr. Sanger, are you from Washington?

296
00:31:27,984 --> 00:31:29,413
No. Wisconsin.

297
00:31:29,904 --> 00:31:31,627
And what brought you here?

298
00:31:32,273 --> 00:31:36,583
I was a legislative aide
for my home senator, Gaylord Nelson.

299
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,079
-I was 21, anything was possible.
-Thank you.

300
00:31:39,154 --> 00:31:41,871
-You learn quickly....
-Thank you, Mr. Sanger.

301
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:45,003
Do you have faith
in the American justice system?

302
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:46,924
It seems to work.

303
00:31:47,027 --> 00:31:49,777
Do you believe that a man is innocent
until proven guilty?

304
00:31:49,843 --> 00:31:50,857
Absolutely.

305
00:31:50,932 --> 00:31:53,387
You've stated the punishment
should fit the crime.

306
00:31:53,461 --> 00:31:54,257
Yes.

307
00:31:54,325 --> 00:31:56,430
Would you turn around, Mr. Sanger?

308
00:31:57,397 --> 00:31:58,345
Excuse me?

309
00:31:58,422 --> 00:32:02,732
Just turn around and face
the back of the courtroom, please.

310
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:09,102
Mr. Sanger,
could you tell me what color my hair is?

311
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,912
Brown.

312
00:32:13,944 --> 00:32:16,148
Does my hair look brown to you?

313
00:32:16,536 --> 00:32:21,522
You asked me what color your hair was.
I thought you wanted the real color.

314
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,477
You're very observant.

315
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:26,776
But appearances can be deceiving.

316
00:32:27,098 --> 00:32:31,703
Sometimes circumstances make the truth
almost impossible to find.

317
00:32:32,443 --> 00:32:35,410
As jurors you will be asked
to keep an open mind...

318
00:32:35,483 --> 00:32:37,555
...to put aside your assumptions...

319
00:32:37,628 --> 00:32:40,890
...and to look for and find that truth.

320
00:32:42,717 --> 00:32:44,440
What if I'd said ''black''?

321
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:46,450
I ask the questions here.

322
00:32:47,453 --> 00:32:50,104
-How many challenges do I have left?
-One.

323
00:32:50,175 --> 00:32:52,182
Thank you for coming, Mr. Sanger.

324
00:32:52,254 --> 00:32:55,832
-Does that mean I'm excused?
-No, it doesn't.

325
00:33:03,776 --> 00:33:05,915
What are you, an immigrant?
Nobody has jury duty.

326
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:08,985
Next you're gonna tell me you vote.

327
00:33:11,426 --> 00:33:13,946
Good evening, Mr. Sanger, Mr. Everett.

328
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:15,579
Well, hello, Marilyn.

329
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,373
How are things?
I haven't seen you around.

330
00:33:17,443 --> 00:33:18,206
Something to drink?

331
00:33:18,276 --> 00:33:20,131
Stolichnaya vodka martini,
straight up, three olives.

332
00:33:20,196 --> 00:33:22,138
-You working?
-Justice.

333
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,576
Third girl
in the Deputy Attorney GeneraI's office.

334
00:33:24,676 --> 00:33:25,952
Paul Gray?

335
00:33:26,661 --> 00:33:27,708
Type much?

336
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,070
The job doesn't require much typing.

337
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:33,216
Anyway, it's temporary.

338
00:33:33,286 --> 00:33:36,450
Paul says he wants to groom me
for management.

339
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:39,774
I wish I had a dollar for every promise.

340
00:33:40,199 --> 00:33:42,370
Just once, I wish an ''I can't help you out.''

341
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:43,421
Let's go.

342
00:33:43,624 --> 00:33:45,664
-The boy wonder.
-Hi, Paul. How are you?

343
00:33:45,736 --> 00:33:47,361
-Let's catch up sometime.
-Yeah.

344
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:48,381
Come on.

345
00:33:56,874 --> 00:33:57,888
Congressman.

346
00:33:58,026 --> 00:34:00,579
-How's it look, Eddie?
-Oh, it's down to the wire, sir.

347
00:34:00,651 --> 00:34:03,433
-Call me if I can do anything.
-Thank you very much.

348
00:34:05,804 --> 00:34:09,895
Fuck him. I called him three different
times. He never returns my calls.

349
00:34:14,445 --> 00:34:15,754
There's Comisky.

350
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:18,473
Maybe you should take another run at her.

351
00:34:28,431 --> 00:34:29,379
Grace.

352
00:34:30,384 --> 00:34:31,561
Hello, Eddie.

353
00:34:32,176 --> 00:34:33,386
Are you alone?

354
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,964
I stayed in the office late, and just
stopped in to catch my breath. I'm beat.

355
00:34:38,514 --> 00:34:41,809
I'm out on my feet. I've been
up and down the Hill all day for votes.

356
00:34:41,874 --> 00:34:43,215
Do you mind?

357
00:34:43,923 --> 00:34:47,185
-Do you want a drink?
-No, it wouldn't have any effect anymore.

358
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,928
I've been nursing drinks and listening
to the sound of my own voice since 5:00.

359
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:55,791
I know the feeling. There's a vote
coming up on a bill that I cosponsored.

360
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:59,435
It gives me a knot in my stomach
like a fist.

361
00:34:59,509 --> 00:35:02,029
Closer the vote, tighter the fist.

362
00:35:02,678 --> 00:35:04,205
Grabs me a little lower.

363
00:35:07,446 --> 00:35:08,973
How close is the vote?

364
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:13,654
Well, let's see, if everything falls right,
we're still a handful short.

365
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:20,943
I never noticed your eyes.

366
00:35:21,017 --> 00:35:23,635
Sometimes they're blue,
sometimes they're green.

367
00:35:27,034 --> 00:35:28,856
You're still a handful short.

368
00:35:30,011 --> 00:35:33,721
-I told you, my vote's not for sale.
-I can't help myself, Grace.

369
00:35:35,324 --> 00:35:40,027
It's a lovely thought anyway. Nobody's
mentioned my eyes in a long time.

370
00:35:54,783 --> 00:35:56,987
-There's another stop.
-How much do I owe you?

371
00:35:57,151 --> 00:35:58,263
$7.50.

372
00:35:58,495 --> 00:36:00,437
Here, keep the change.

373
00:37:28,751 --> 00:37:30,758
Michael, you are served.

374
00:37:39,473 --> 00:37:43,248
His face was completely rearranged.
He spent half the night in surgery.

375
00:37:43,537 --> 00:37:46,319
By the time the police arrived,
the assailant had fled.

376
00:37:46,386 --> 00:37:48,142
That's why I need a continuance...

377
00:37:48,211 --> 00:37:50,578
...until Michael John Guthridge
can be apprehended.

378
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:54,058
I don't see any need for a continuance.
The subject was served a subpoena.

379
00:37:54,132 --> 00:37:56,718
He's required to appear
or be in contempt of process.

380
00:37:56,788 --> 00:37:58,413
You've got to be joking.

381
00:37:58,964 --> 00:38:02,794
There's not a chance in hell that this man
is going to voluntarily appear.

382
00:38:03,094 --> 00:38:04,654
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

383
00:38:05,558 --> 00:38:06,834
I sympathize with you.

384
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:10,709
I was a trial attorney for a number
of years, at the mercy of witnesses.

385
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:14,774
If we had to wait for every supposed
witness, we would grind to a halt.

386
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:16,814
It could take months to locate this man.

387
00:38:16,888 --> 00:38:20,882
With no guarantee that he'll testify,
or that he'll have anything to testify about.

388
00:38:21,337 --> 00:38:24,850
ln all fairness to my client,
I cannot present a complete defense...

389
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:26,546
...without this witness.

390
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:30,232
I'm sorry.
Your request for a continuance is denied.

391
00:38:35,003 --> 00:38:36,083
Miss Riley?

392
00:38:37,052 --> 00:38:38,994
Don't try to contaminate the process...

393
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:42,167
...with any backdoor comments
about this witness in open court.

394
00:38:43,644 --> 00:38:46,197
How can I possibly
contaminate this process?

395
00:39:19,074 --> 00:39:20,503
Opening statements, Mr. Stella.

396
00:39:39,526 --> 00:39:41,020
Elizabeth Rose Quinn.

397
00:39:44,263 --> 00:39:45,343
She was 24.

398
00:39:47,432 --> 00:39:49,799
A clerk/typist at the Justice Department.

399
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:55,235
She made $17,000 a year. She was single.

400
00:39:56,073 --> 00:40:00,710
She liked to play tennis. She was a
member of the Baptist Church in Arlington.

401
00:40:03,146 --> 00:40:05,218
She wasn't very important.

402
00:40:07,147 --> 00:40:10,442
Especially in a city
that's full of so many important people.

403
00:40:12,876 --> 00:40:15,298
She was just a decent,
hardworking citizen.

404
00:40:19,853 --> 00:40:21,795
On the night of December 18...

405
00:40:22,285 --> 00:40:24,140
...a week before Christmas...

406
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:30,278
...Carl Wayne Anderson, in cold blood...

407
00:40:32,912 --> 00:40:34,253
...cut her throat.

408
00:40:38,577 --> 00:40:40,846
I've prosecuted 43 murder cases.

409
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:44,104
It's always a horror. It's always senseless.

410
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:47,527
Of all the murder cases I have prosecuted...

411
00:40:47,634 --> 00:40:51,082
...this is the most horrible,
the most senseless...

412
00:40:51,186 --> 00:40:52,877
...the most indefensible.

413
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:55,888
For $9.00.

414
00:40:58,676 --> 00:40:59,853
$9.00.

415
00:41:02,645 --> 00:41:04,685
$9.00, that's all she had.

416
00:41:06,678 --> 00:41:10,672
Is this what we've become?
Is the value of human life so cheap?

417
00:41:14,134 --> 00:41:17,003
Elizabeth worked late that night.
It was cold.

418
00:41:17,591 --> 00:41:19,795
She was tired and anxious to get home.

419
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,532
She took the bus to the parking lot
on K Street where her car was.

420
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:27,379
That's as far as she got.

421
00:41:29,274 --> 00:41:32,089
We will show that Carl Wayne Anderson
had been in there...

422
00:41:32,186 --> 00:41:34,008
...trying to break into cars.

423
00:41:34,586 --> 00:41:37,652
He had been sleeping in Elizabeth's car...

424
00:41:38,715 --> 00:41:41,301
...and a parking lot attendant
had chased him away.

425
00:41:42,716 --> 00:41:44,504
But he had come back.

426
00:41:47,261 --> 00:41:50,709
And when he saw Elizabeth
alone and defenseless...

427
00:41:51,806 --> 00:41:55,996
...he beat her, dragged her down
to the river, slit her throat and killed her.

428
00:42:01,247 --> 00:42:02,938
This isn't the 11:00 news.

429
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:08,796
We can't just shake our heads,
go to bed and forget about it.

430
00:42:09,857 --> 00:42:13,370
We have a responsibility
to Elizabeth Rose Quinn.

431
00:42:15,106 --> 00:42:17,310
She is, after all...

432
00:42:18,722 --> 00:42:20,031
...too important.

433
00:42:27,395 --> 00:42:28,475
Miss Riley?

434
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,073
Carl Wayne Anderson is not a decent,
hardworking citizen.

435
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:47,073
He is not a shining example
of the American dream.

436
00:42:48,423 --> 00:42:50,725
Carl Anderson is the American nightmare.

437
00:42:57,737 --> 00:43:00,999
He's one of the nameless,
faceless derelicts that...

438
00:43:01,321 --> 00:43:05,544
...wander aimlessly through the streets
of our country every day by the thousands.

439
00:43:05,995 --> 00:43:07,751
We step over them in doorways.

440
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:09,794
We cross the street...

441
00:43:10,827 --> 00:43:13,926
...in order to avoid having to come
into contact with one of them.

442
00:43:14,412 --> 00:43:18,722
We look at them with a mixture of pity
and contempt and fear.

443
00:43:19,949 --> 00:43:22,916
And we choose not to see
that under their ragged blankets...

444
00:43:23,021 --> 00:43:27,778
...and their filthy clothes is a frightened,
lost human being...

445
00:43:28,782 --> 00:43:30,243
...just like you and me.

446
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:32,969
Carl Wayne Anderson
was a soldier in Vietnam...

447
00:43:33,455 --> 00:43:35,430
...not a hero, just a dog soldier...

448
00:43:35,856 --> 00:43:38,376
...who believed in
and fought for his country.

449
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:43,814
When he tried to regain his identity...

450
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:46,671
...and his self-respect
in a veterans hospital...

451
00:43:48,274 --> 00:43:51,722
...he contracted spinal meningitis,
became deaf...

452
00:43:52,722 --> 00:43:55,722
...and suffered a traumatic speech loss.

453
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:03,569
We will show that Carl Anderson
lived in a world where $9.00...

454
00:44:03,636 --> 00:44:06,931
...could mean the difference
between eating and starving to death.

455
00:44:14,742 --> 00:44:17,131
What's going on?
The vote's supposed to be next week.

456
00:44:17,206 --> 00:44:20,501
They were getting ready to adjourn.
The leadership called for the vote.

457
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:21,744
What's the count?

458
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,880
We're on the button.
The right ''yes'' puts us over the top.

459
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:56,662
No comment.

460
00:45:05,759 --> 00:45:09,371
Eddie, you lucked out. Her committee
chairman must have persuaded Comisky...

461
00:45:09,472 --> 00:45:10,716
...to vote yes.

462
00:45:10,848 --> 00:45:12,703
That must have been it, Congressman.

463
00:45:12,768 --> 00:45:14,012
Give me a call.

464
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,239
Nice job, Eddie.

465
00:45:33,508 --> 00:45:35,548
Could you describe what you found?

466
00:45:35,781 --> 00:45:37,569
She'd been attacked from behind.

467
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,089
Her throat cut laterally across the larynx
and the carotid artery...

468
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:42,531
...from left to right.

469
00:45:42,598 --> 00:45:44,573
And what kind of instrument caused this?

470
00:45:44,646 --> 00:45:47,995
A very thin, straight blade.
A razor, a knife.

471
00:45:49,382 --> 00:45:53,539
I'm showing you what's been marked as
Government Exhibit 1 for identification.

472
00:45:53,608 --> 00:45:55,550
Have you seen this knife before?

473
00:45:57,609 --> 00:46:00,391
Yes. I was asked to do
a forensic examination of it.

474
00:46:00,521 --> 00:46:02,463
And what were your conclusions?

475
00:46:02,953 --> 00:46:05,375
The width of the blade and its sharpness...

476
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:07,905
...were consistent
with the deceased's wound.

477
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:12,137
I move Government Exhibit 1 in evidence.

478
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:13,508
Without objection.

479
00:46:14,988 --> 00:46:16,165
Your witness.

480
00:46:16,396 --> 00:46:19,712
Before Miss Riley cross-examines
we'll take a 15-minute recess.

481
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,180
You're excused, Doctor.

482
00:46:22,284 --> 00:46:26,921
Excuse me, Your Honor, may I have
another look at that photograph?

483
00:46:27,437 --> 00:46:30,753
Objection, Your Honor.
This has become ghoulish beyond purpose.

484
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:34,762
The juror is entitled to a thorough
examination of the evidence. Overruled.

485
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:45,415
Thank you.

486
00:46:58,227 --> 00:47:01,489
I'll remind the jury, you are not to discuss
this case with anyone.

487
00:47:14,102 --> 00:47:15,346
Okay, let's go.

488
00:47:23,703 --> 00:47:25,590
Miss Riley? There was a call for you.

489
00:47:25,688 --> 00:47:28,274
He wouldn't give me his name.
He left a number.

490
00:47:28,568 --> 00:47:29,745
Okay, thanks.

491
00:47:35,994 --> 00:47:37,903
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hi, this is Kathleen Riley.

492
00:47:37,978 --> 00:47:41,393
<i>Yes. Do you know if your client</i>
<i>is right or left-handed?</i>

493
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:42,514
Excuse me?

494
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:46,072
<i>Do you know if Carl is right or left-handed?</i>

495
00:47:46,139 --> 00:47:47,251
Who is this?

496
00:47:48,124 --> 00:47:50,393
<i>I noticed something.</i>
<i>I was wondering if you did.</i>

497
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,572
Who is this?

498
00:48:01,406 --> 00:48:04,275
Dr. Koleena, you examined
Carl Anderson's knife, didn't you?

499
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,139
-Yes, I did.
-And what did you find?

500
00:48:07,391 --> 00:48:12,181
Some rust, a partial hair follicle
and microscopic traces of human tissue.

501
00:48:13,696 --> 00:48:15,703
And did you compare the tissue...

502
00:48:16,129 --> 00:48:18,879
...taken off of his knife
with Elizabeth Quinn's?

503
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:20,470
Yes.

504
00:48:20,545 --> 00:48:23,327
And would you tell the jury
what your findings were?

505
00:48:23,714 --> 00:48:25,088
They were inconclusive.

506
00:48:25,538 --> 00:48:28,255
Excuse me, Dr. Koleena,
could you please speak up?

507
00:48:29,026 --> 00:48:30,553
They weren't conclusive.

508
00:48:31,331 --> 00:48:32,956
They weren't conclusive.

509
00:48:33,635 --> 00:48:35,577
So what you're saying is that...

510
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,293
...you have no direct evidence
that this knife, Carl Anderson's knife...

511
00:48:39,396 --> 00:48:42,146
...was the weapon used
to murder Elizabeth Rose Quinn.

512
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,514
No bone fragments...

513
00:48:44,614 --> 00:48:48,575
...no tissue samples,
no traces of her blood.

514
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:51,871
I don't know what we would have found.
The knife had been cleaned.

515
00:48:51,943 --> 00:48:55,685
Excuse me, didn't you say a moment ago
that you found rust and a hair follicle...

516
00:48:55,752 --> 00:48:58,141
...and some sort of tissue on this knife?

517
00:48:58,856 --> 00:49:01,278
So was it wiped clean
or wasn't it wiped clean?

518
00:49:01,384 --> 00:49:03,718
It's more complicated than that.
There's a wide--

519
00:49:03,817 --> 00:49:06,632
No, it's not more complicated.
It's either simple yes or no.

520
00:49:06,697 --> 00:49:08,224
It was cleaned or it wasn't.

521
00:49:08,297 --> 00:49:11,494
Objection!
Forensic pathology is an exact science.

522
00:49:11,626 --> 00:49:14,081
Miss Riley is making this sound
like a cooking class.

523
00:49:14,315 --> 00:49:15,362
Excuse me?

524
00:49:15,435 --> 00:49:19,177
Objection sustained. And dispense
with your characterizations, Mr. Stella.

525
00:49:19,307 --> 00:49:22,274
My apologies to the court and to counsel.

526
00:49:24,141 --> 00:49:26,246
Thank you, but I don't want the jury left...

527
00:49:26,317 --> 00:49:29,317
...with the impression that Mr. Anderson
cleaned off his knife...

528
00:49:29,389 --> 00:49:31,276
...to hide any incriminating evidence.

529
00:49:31,341 --> 00:49:32,770
Objection sustained.

530
00:49:35,694 --> 00:49:38,149
Miss Riley,
are you through with the witness?

531
00:49:38,383 --> 00:49:39,430
Yes, I am.

532
00:49:39,535 --> 00:49:41,095
Doctor, you're excused.

533
00:49:48,081 --> 00:49:49,936
Your Honor, one more question.

534
00:49:50,897 --> 00:49:52,752
Make up your mind, Miss Riley.

535
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:59,945
You've said
that the wound was left to right.

536
00:50:00,307 --> 00:50:03,057
That's correct.
The entry wound was left of median...

537
00:50:03,156 --> 00:50:05,228
...and the exit wound right of median.

538
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,623
-Entrance here, exit here.
-That's correct.

539
00:50:08,821 --> 00:50:10,544
Could you step down for a moment?

540
00:50:10,612 --> 00:50:12,172
Objection. What is the point?

541
00:50:12,245 --> 00:50:14,187
I need to make a clarification.

542
00:50:15,094 --> 00:50:18,410
I'll overrule the objection.
Doctor, will you please step down?

543
00:50:20,214 --> 00:50:24,819
Now, Dr. Koleena, I'm right-handed,
so could I assume that it would be...

544
00:50:24,887 --> 00:50:27,822
...a natural motion for me
to cut you this way?

545
00:50:28,247 --> 00:50:29,195
Yes.

546
00:50:29,336 --> 00:50:32,336
And if I were left-handed,
that would be an unnatural motion?

547
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,447
Yes. You would cut right to left.

548
00:50:34,969 --> 00:50:37,652
Thank you very much.
I have no further questions.

549
00:50:37,722 --> 00:50:39,282
You're excused, Doctor.

550
00:50:42,298 --> 00:50:43,246
Carl?

551
00:50:44,154 --> 00:50:45,463
Objection, Your Honor--

552
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,024
One more stunt like that and I'll slap you...

553
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:50,099
...with a contempt citation so fast,
you won't know what hit you.

554
00:51:00,062 --> 00:51:02,233
Mr. Sanger, don't ever do that again.

555
00:51:07,966 --> 00:51:09,395
Hey! Wait a minute!

556
00:51:09,471 --> 00:51:11,893
I'm not allowed to talk to you, Mr. Sanger.

557
00:51:12,479 --> 00:51:14,235
The least you could do is thank me.

558
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:18,428
Thank you! I should go to the judge
and have you thrown off this panel.

559
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:22,678
Nobody twisted your arm to use it.
I was just trying to help.

560
00:51:22,754 --> 00:51:23,736
I didn't ask for help.

561
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:25,184
-Hi, Kathleen.
-Hi.

562
00:51:27,394 --> 00:51:31,136
You're not the one on trial, Miss Riley.
I thought the idea was to find the truth.

563
00:51:31,235 --> 00:51:34,082
-I guess I got the wrong idea about justice.
-Don't hustle me!

564
00:51:34,147 --> 00:51:37,463
You can save that bullshit
for your friends up on Capitol Hill.

565
00:51:41,253 --> 00:51:45,279
We all know that you're just
brimming over with integrity, Miss Riley.

566
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:47,870
Who the fuck are you
to preach to me about mine?

567
00:51:47,941 --> 00:51:50,275
If you really want to be helpful,
leave me alone.

568
00:51:50,342 --> 00:51:52,033
Jury tampering is a felony.

569
00:51:52,102 --> 00:51:54,491
Well, you haven't tampered with me...yet.

570
00:51:54,919 --> 00:51:56,446
And I don't intend to.

571
00:51:58,055 --> 00:51:59,964
Well, you want to win, don't you?

572
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:05,152
Look, this is not a game.
A man's life is at stake here.

573
00:52:05,353 --> 00:52:07,011
Of course, I want to win.

574
00:52:07,465 --> 00:52:09,832
But I draw the line at certain things.

575
00:52:10,633 --> 00:52:12,705
Obviously, you never draw the line.

576
00:52:17,931 --> 00:52:19,338
I change it all the time.

577
00:52:21,547 --> 00:52:22,791
Hey, I'm sorry.

578
00:52:23,788 --> 00:52:27,268
I'm sorry.
I thought you were allergic to milk.

579
00:52:30,157 --> 00:52:31,105
I lied.

580
00:52:34,638 --> 00:52:35,979
Did he kill her?

581
00:52:36,046 --> 00:52:37,475
That's your problem.

582
00:53:02,418 --> 00:53:06,608
We got to write 'em down every two hours
to see how long they been here.

583
00:53:06,964 --> 00:53:10,280
It's surprising the number of those
trying to beat you out of some bucks...

584
00:53:10,356 --> 00:53:12,112
...telling you they lost their ticket.

585
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:15,377
That's a ''9''.
You wrote an ''8''. See, it's a ''9''.

586
00:53:15,445 --> 00:53:18,292
I mix 'em up sometimes
when I'm in a hurry, all right?

587
00:53:19,286 --> 00:53:21,522
You say you got somethin'
to do with the trial?

588
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:22,997
A friend of the court.

589
00:53:23,062 --> 00:53:25,812
Yeah, I got me a subpoena.
I'm supposed to testify.

590
00:53:26,422 --> 00:53:27,851
You ain't no lawyer?

591
00:53:28,088 --> 00:53:29,036
No.

592
00:53:29,848 --> 00:53:32,663
They should send a shitload
of 'em back to Beantown.

593
00:53:34,072 --> 00:53:36,723
-It was slow that night.
-KBG 622.

594
00:53:38,073 --> 00:53:41,422
There couldn't have been more than 10,
15 cars on the lot.

595
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:45,171
She was parked down on the end.
The white Honda.

596
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:48,217
The city's supposed to pick it up,
but you know...

597
00:53:48,283 --> 00:53:50,355
...they take their sweet-ass time.

598
00:54:02,398 --> 00:54:04,667
-So the bearded mother, the bum?
-Yeah.

599
00:54:04,798 --> 00:54:08,540
He been hangin' around off and on most
of the night. Let me tell you somethin'.

600
00:54:08,607 --> 00:54:11,738
I got a case of trouble with them people.
He's roamin' around...

601
00:54:11,806 --> 00:54:16,116
...looking for an unlocked car. He crawled
into that woman's car and went to sleep.

602
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,556
I ran his ratty ass outta there.

603
00:54:19,392 --> 00:54:21,847
The bus dropped her off
a little after midnight...

604
00:54:22,209 --> 00:54:24,478
...and I saw him hanging around again.

605
00:54:24,577 --> 00:54:27,577
But it was too fuckin' cold to go out
and mess with him.

606
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:31,294
I remember thinkin', ''It's kinda strange
she didn't just drive right out.''

607
00:54:31,362 --> 00:54:35,159
Then my girl called and we got into it,
you know, and I just forgot about her.

608
00:54:35,235 --> 00:54:37,177
The bum iced her right around then.

609
00:54:37,347 --> 00:54:38,754
Did you see anybody else?

610
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:40,312
No. Nobody to speak of.

611
00:54:40,932 --> 00:54:43,801
Man, we get cars in and out of here
all the time.

612
00:54:44,612 --> 00:54:47,427
And I slept some.
They don't pay me enough...

613
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,729
...to freeze my jones off
and stay awake, too.

614
00:54:49,798 --> 00:54:52,002
-You know what I'm saying?
-Yeah.

615
00:54:52,774 --> 00:54:55,425
That list...
with the license plate numbers on it?

616
00:54:55,495 --> 00:54:58,594
-Yeah.
-The one from that night, do you have it?

617
00:54:58,663 --> 00:55:00,735
Yeah, I got a copy if you want it.

618
00:55:10,633 --> 00:55:12,193
Might as well keep it, man.

619
00:55:12,265 --> 00:55:14,883
I don't know
what they save this bull for anyway.

620
00:55:15,594 --> 00:55:16,542
Oh, shit.

621
00:55:22,155 --> 00:55:23,715
How long you gonna be?

622
00:55:27,468 --> 00:55:28,416
Thanks.

623
00:56:11,604 --> 00:56:13,131
Excuse me, ma'am?

624
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,597
Where did you get that?

625
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:24,430
Over there.

626
00:56:25,078 --> 00:56:27,828
-Could I ask you when you found it?
-For Christmas.

627
00:56:31,128 --> 00:56:32,469
Would you sell it?

628
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,225
It isn't for sale.

629
00:56:36,088 --> 00:56:37,429
I'll trade for it.

630
00:56:38,745 --> 00:56:40,054
What do you want?

631
00:56:40,473 --> 00:56:41,455
Your shoes.

632
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,384
My shoes.

633
00:57:01,148 --> 00:57:02,392
And your socks.

634
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:21,943
Thank you.

635
00:58:53,585 --> 00:58:54,533
Hello?

636
00:58:54,704 --> 00:58:56,231
<i>I have to talk to you.</i>

637
00:58:56,817 --> 00:58:58,857
-I can't hear you.
<i>-I have to talk to you.</i>

638
00:58:58,929 --> 00:59:01,449
<i>-I'll meet you at the Federal Station.</i>
-Who is this?

639
00:59:01,521 --> 00:59:03,888
<i>I'll meet you in five minutes. Be there.</i>

640
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,668
Mr. Sanger,
I told you to stay away from me.

641
00:59:11,828 --> 00:59:12,776
Michael?

642
01:00:33,953 --> 01:00:35,741
What do you think you're doing here?

643
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:38,079
If I had said it was me,
you wouldn't have come.

644
01:00:38,146 --> 01:00:39,739
-You're right.
-Wait a minute.

645
01:00:39,811 --> 01:00:41,633
Wait just a minute, all right?

646
01:00:42,339 --> 01:00:45,655
A bag lady found this down by the river
where Elizabeth was killed.

647
01:00:45,732 --> 01:00:47,423
What are you, a detective now?

648
01:00:47,493 --> 01:00:49,118
I'm an amateur, but look at it.

649
01:00:49,189 --> 01:00:51,906
The presidential seaI's on it.
It's got his signature on--

650
01:00:51,973 --> 01:00:54,144
So what?
You can buy this at any gift store?

651
01:00:54,214 --> 01:00:56,734
No, not one of these, you can't.
It's solid gold.

652
01:00:56,806 --> 01:00:59,556
The President gives them out
as special gifts.

653
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:02,589
Senators, cabinet members, big donors...

654
01:01:03,495 --> 01:01:04,575
...some lobbyists.

655
01:01:05,607 --> 01:01:07,909
Look, the river is filled with garbage, okay?

656
01:01:07,976 --> 01:01:10,693
Half the city washes up there.
What does it prove?

657
01:01:13,672 --> 01:01:15,581
That's your problem, Counselor.

658
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,908
Get some sleep, okay? You look tired.

659
01:01:35,437 --> 01:01:37,259
God is angry with the wicked.

660
01:01:37,677 --> 01:01:40,492
-Why did you send the black devil for me?
-Because Carl--

661
01:01:40,557 --> 01:01:42,379
Carl has already been judged.

662
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:45,349
The mighty hand
struck him deaf and dumb.

663
01:01:45,582 --> 01:01:47,851
Only the Lord Jesus can take a soul.

664
01:01:48,623 --> 01:01:51,754
I saw the angel of death.
I watched her die.

665
01:01:52,495 --> 01:01:56,751
I saw her spirit leave her body. She gave
me a message from the Almighty.

666
01:01:58,608 --> 01:02:00,069
A key to the kingdom.

667
01:02:04,338 --> 01:02:07,240
The innocent
shall know the glory of heaven.

668
01:02:14,196 --> 01:02:15,505
Stop it, asshole.

669
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:28,783
This is probably gonna burn.

670
01:02:28,854 --> 01:02:30,447
Okay. All right.

671
01:02:33,622 --> 01:02:34,931
God! Let me sit down.

672
01:02:35,032 --> 01:02:38,032
If you feel you're gonna faint,
put your head between your knees.

673
01:02:38,104 --> 01:02:41,399
-You think it'll leave a scar?
-I don't know. Could you sit still?

674
01:02:41,497 --> 01:02:43,668
-It hurts, damn it.
-Well, I'm sorry.

675
01:02:44,313 --> 01:02:45,774
It shouldn't hurt that much.

676
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:48,020
-Oh, yeah? Well, it--
-Hold on, hold on.

677
01:02:48,089 --> 01:02:49,518
You got a piece right here.

678
01:02:49,593 --> 01:02:50,770
I know. I know.

679
01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:52,081
It hurts, damn it!

680
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:53,615
You're such a baby.

681
01:02:56,955 --> 01:02:59,344
He got me, didn't he?

682
01:03:00,028 --> 01:03:03,127
You know, you're lucky that you had
your jacket and your sweater on.

683
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,821
Yeah, I feel real lucky.

684
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:12,757
All right.

685
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:25,272
Maybe you're not as big an asshole
as I thought you were.

686
01:03:26,496 --> 01:03:28,438
All right, it's a little better.

687
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:50,940
Good night.

688
01:04:15,273 --> 01:04:17,990
You know,
I know that people have no values today.

689
01:04:19,721 --> 01:04:23,878
Psychiatrists sleep with their patients,
lawyers sleep with their clients...

690
01:04:24,491 --> 01:04:26,466
...professors sleep with their students.

691
01:04:26,539 --> 01:04:27,783
I'm no angel...

692
01:04:31,883 --> 01:04:34,250
...but I'm having a hard time...

693
01:04:34,316 --> 01:04:37,066
...just pretending
like it's business as usual.

694
01:05:00,144 --> 01:05:02,053
-Don't make a scene.
-All right.

695
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:07,467
-Are you trying to get me disbarred?
-Just listen to me a minute.

696
01:05:07,538 --> 01:05:10,538
The President gave away
30 pairs of cuff links for Christmas.

697
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:11,984
They went out on the 15th.

698
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:14,505
He gave a set to Deputy Attorney General,
Paul Gray.

699
01:05:14,899 --> 01:05:17,485
I know a girl who works in his office.

700
01:05:18,067 --> 01:05:22,323
She told me that he brought up a couple
of girls from clerical, working nights.

701
01:05:23,093 --> 01:05:25,165
And one of them was Elizabeth Quinn.

702
01:05:25,461 --> 01:05:29,258
So what are you saying? Because she
happened to work for him, he killed her?

703
01:05:31,062 --> 01:05:32,272
I need the cuff link.

704
01:05:32,342 --> 01:05:33,651
Fuck the cuff link.

705
01:05:33,719 --> 01:05:36,370
What you're asking me to do
is absolutely illegal.

706
01:05:36,439 --> 01:05:39,887
You're gonna let your client fry
because you want to play by the rules?

707
01:05:39,991 --> 01:05:43,024
No, I would do anything for my client.
I'm the only chance he has.

708
01:05:43,128 --> 01:05:45,648
-But I'm not gonna break the law.
-All right.

709
01:05:47,801 --> 01:05:49,873
If he did it, I'm gonna vote guilty.

710
01:05:50,361 --> 01:05:53,394
But if he's innocent,
I don't want that on my conscience.

711
01:06:23,263 --> 01:06:25,849
Miss Riley?
I want to see you in my chambers.

712
01:06:26,272 --> 01:06:27,220
Now?

713
01:06:27,295 --> 01:06:28,309
Now.

714
01:06:30,913 --> 01:06:32,538
Have a seat, Miss Riley.

715
01:06:33,825 --> 01:06:35,319
I saw you the other day.

716
01:06:35,426 --> 01:06:38,273
I had the impression
you were talking with one of the jurors.

717
01:06:38,338 --> 01:06:40,826
Have you had contact
with a juror on this trial?

718
01:06:40,898 --> 01:06:41,846
No.

719
01:06:45,219 --> 01:06:47,291
I'll have to take you at your word.

720
01:06:48,131 --> 01:06:50,171
I'm very disappointed in you, Miss Riley.

721
01:06:50,243 --> 01:06:53,505
I had heard good things about you.
But your cross has been weak.

722
01:06:53,605 --> 01:06:56,605
Your behavior in this courtroom
has been unprofessional.

723
01:06:57,445 --> 01:07:01,820
Well, I'm frustrated, Your Honor, because
I have no character witnesses and...

724
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:04,638
...I have no one
to corroborate my client's story.

725
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:06,946
Now I have no material witness, so l...

726
01:07:07,879 --> 01:07:09,951
...I desperately need a continuance.

727
01:07:10,023 --> 01:07:13,536
Come on, we've been through this.
You know how I feel about that.

728
01:07:13,608 --> 01:07:17,252
Your Honor, last night Michael John
Guthridge contacted me and said things...

729
01:07:17,321 --> 01:07:21,412
...that convinced me that if he isn't
the real suspect, then he saw who is.

730
01:07:21,673 --> 01:07:23,648
And you think he can identify the killer?

731
01:07:23,722 --> 01:07:24,736
Yes, I do.

732
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:29,120
Why is it whenever defense is in trouble,
there always seems to be a ''reaI'' suspect?

733
01:07:29,195 --> 01:07:31,977
I'd genuinely like to help,
but it would be imprudent of me...

734
01:07:32,043 --> 01:07:34,432
...to grant a continuance
because your case is weak.

735
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,122
Your dedication is commendable.

736
01:07:37,324 --> 01:07:39,560
Don't be tempted
to sacrifice your integrity.

737
01:07:40,012 --> 01:07:43,307
I warn you, Miss Riley,
if I find any evidence of collusion...

738
01:07:43,373 --> 01:07:46,123
...you'll be disbarred
and charged with jury tampering.

739
01:07:50,606 --> 01:07:53,475
Thank you all very much for coming.
Thank you.

740
01:07:59,888 --> 01:08:01,415
Have you a minute, sir?

741
01:08:01,489 --> 01:08:02,950
What's this ''sir'' shit, Eddie?

742
01:08:03,024 --> 01:08:05,195
You never respected me
when I was on the Hill.

743
01:08:05,265 --> 01:08:07,207
Well, you weren't a ''sir'' then.

744
01:08:08,402 --> 01:08:10,027
Good afternoon, Mr. Gray.

745
01:08:11,922 --> 01:08:14,410
From where I sit,
you have to be very discreet.

746
01:08:14,515 --> 01:08:17,548
Come on, Paul,
discretion was never your best position.

747
01:08:17,812 --> 01:08:19,721
I hear you've taken up my slack.

748
01:08:19,987 --> 01:08:23,249
Well, you know what they say.
You can't measure a live snake.

749
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:26,707
A friend of mine was at a party
the other night.

750
01:08:27,605 --> 01:08:30,671
He runs down by the Potomac.
He's a jogger. He found this.

751
01:08:31,286 --> 01:08:34,101
I remember you wearing
a pair at the reception.

752
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:35,988
It's not something you want to lose.

753
01:08:36,055 --> 01:08:38,444
I thought maybe
you weren't discreet enough.

754
01:08:38,519 --> 01:08:40,559
I didn't want it to come back to haunt you.

755
01:08:40,631 --> 01:08:44,177
I haven't lost one that I know of,
but I appreciate your concern.

756
01:08:45,016 --> 01:08:47,766
Whoever did lose it
might not want it to be found.

757
01:08:47,896 --> 01:08:51,212
Asking people about it
isn't such a bright idea.

758
01:08:51,929 --> 01:08:53,489
It's a good way to make enemies.

759
01:08:53,849 --> 01:08:56,271
And this is a bad place to have enemies.

760
01:08:56,506 --> 01:09:00,467
Paul, you were the one who told me
that everybody's your enemy.

761
01:09:02,811 --> 01:09:05,494
It just isn't very smart
to go looking for them.

762
01:09:05,596 --> 01:09:07,003
Maybe you're right.

763
01:09:08,156 --> 01:09:10,807
Oh, Eddie? Let's see that again.

764
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:19,795
I'll take a look at home. Maybe it is mine.
You don't need it for anything, do you?

765
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:21,270
What'll I do with it?

766
01:09:37,153 --> 01:09:39,968
Detective Purcell,
you stated earlier in your testimony...

767
01:09:40,066 --> 01:09:44,092
...that homicides are usually committed
by the most obvious suspect.

768
01:09:44,866 --> 01:09:46,654
That's the way it usually falls.

769
01:09:46,723 --> 01:09:49,309
And we will agree
with your logical assumption...

770
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:52,227
...that Mr. Anderson
was the most obvious suspect.

771
01:09:53,508 --> 01:09:56,541
With the evidence and my experience...

772
01:09:56,612 --> 01:09:59,295
...it was more than just an assumption,
Counselor.

773
01:10:01,285 --> 01:10:04,318
Your experience is impressive indeed,
Detective Purcell.

774
01:10:04,486 --> 01:10:07,203
But isn't it true,
in the American justice system...

775
01:10:07,271 --> 01:10:10,620
...that the police do not determine
the guilt or the innocence of a man?

776
01:10:10,887 --> 01:10:12,163
Yes, that's true.

777
01:10:12,711 --> 01:10:15,428
Did you know from
the Justice Department's own research...

778
01:10:15,496 --> 01:10:18,179
...343 innocent people
were convicted of capital crimes?

779
01:10:18,248 --> 01:10:19,141
Objection.

780
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:21,510
Twenty-five were executed
and later found innocent.

781
01:10:21,576 --> 01:10:23,965
-Objection.
-They were the most obvious suspects.

782
01:10:24,042 --> 01:10:27,425
Miss Riley, that's enough.
This is a cross-examination of a witness...

783
01:10:27,498 --> 01:10:29,570
...not an indictment of the justice system.

784
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:33,286
I'm trying to show that the police
aren't infallible. None of us are.

785
01:10:33,355 --> 01:10:35,427
Counselor, approach the bench. Mr. Stella.

786
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:42,922
The jury should deal with the facts
and not with the defense's rhetoric.

787
01:10:43,212 --> 01:10:45,219
Sir, would you step down, please?

788
01:10:47,182 --> 01:10:50,826
Either you'll argue the merits of this case
or I'll excuse the witness.

789
01:10:55,694 --> 01:10:56,938
You understand?

790
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,691
What was that about a rope, Counselor?

791
01:11:06,577 --> 01:11:07,624
Detective Purcell...

792
01:11:07,697 --> 01:11:11,309
...would you say we have an abnormally
large population of homeless?

793
01:11:11,665 --> 01:11:12,592
Yes, I would.

794
01:11:12,658 --> 01:11:16,073
I see them across the street
from the White House in Lafayette Square.

795
01:11:16,691 --> 01:11:20,106
We've cleared most of them out of there.
It just doesn't look good.

796
01:11:20,179 --> 01:11:21,488
Anywhere else?

797
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:23,599
Yes, Union Station.

798
01:11:23,795 --> 01:11:26,413
-We've got a real problem down there.
-Objection.

799
01:11:26,868 --> 01:11:29,934
This is all fascinating,
but where's the defense going with this?

800
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,758
I'll allow her to continue, Counselor.

801
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:33,968
I'm interested to see
where she's going with this.

802
01:11:34,613 --> 01:11:37,842
Thank you, Your Honor.
Now, you said Union Station.

803
01:11:38,231 --> 01:11:41,614
I take the train occasionally
and I've never seen homeless people there.

804
01:11:42,583 --> 01:11:44,917
Well, Counselor, you really have to look.

805
01:11:45,015 --> 01:11:46,771
We've cleared most of them out.

806
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,364
So now they use
the old Railway Express building.

807
01:13:01,637 --> 01:13:02,651
Hello.

808
01:13:05,829 --> 01:13:07,138
I'm looking for somebody.

809
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:09,793
Man, who do you want?

810
01:13:12,038 --> 01:13:13,893
I'm looking for a man....

811
01:13:17,416 --> 01:13:21,573
He's got a tattoo on his hand.
It's a cross. It says ''Jesus the Savior.''

812
01:13:35,178 --> 01:13:36,869
Do you know who I'm talking about?

813
01:14:24,436 --> 01:14:25,777
What's the matter?

814
01:14:27,668 --> 01:14:30,734
I've asked for a delay in the start
of the proceedings this morning.

815
01:14:31,828 --> 01:14:34,959
A man found murdered
at Union Station this morning...

816
01:14:35,029 --> 01:14:37,200
...has been identified
as Michael John Guthridge.

817
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:44,267
Your Honor,
I'd like to ask for a continuance...

818
01:14:44,343 --> 01:14:47,638
...until the police can ascertain
if his murder is related to this case.

819
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:52,432
I'm inclined to agree with you. Counselor?

820
01:14:53,241 --> 01:14:55,543
A decision shouldn't be made
on a continuance...

821
01:14:55,609 --> 01:14:58,292
...until more information is made available.

822
01:14:58,521 --> 01:15:00,343
I would propose we press on.

823
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:05,305
I want to give this proper consideration.
We'll continue with the proceedings...

824
01:15:05,371 --> 01:15:08,218
...and I'll make my decision known
by the end of the court day.

825
01:15:08,283 --> 01:15:09,395
All right.

826
01:15:09,691 --> 01:15:12,080
Bring in the defendant. Call the jury.

827
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:43,135
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
This won't happen again.

828
01:15:43,201 --> 01:15:46,136
The defendant will have his hands cuffed
during the proceedings.

829
01:15:47,266 --> 01:15:48,727
Please don't do this to me.

830
01:15:48,930 --> 01:15:51,101
Your client has done it for you, Counselor.

831
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,345
Call your first witness.

832
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:25,670
Your Honor,
we call Dr. Alan Alpert to the stand.

833
01:16:26,121 --> 01:16:27,844
Call Dr. Alan Alpert.

834
01:16:44,716 --> 01:16:47,978
Raise your right hand, please.
Do you swear to tell the truth...

835
01:16:48,045 --> 01:16:50,827
...the whole truth,
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

836
01:16:50,893 --> 01:16:52,933
-I do.
-You may be seated.

837
01:16:55,918 --> 01:16:59,464
Dr. Alpert, you are a professor
of sociology at Maryland University.

838
01:16:59,535 --> 01:17:01,291
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

839
01:17:02,223 --> 01:17:05,420
-And what is your field of expertise?
-Transient behavior.

840
01:17:05,488 --> 01:17:09,711
Excuse me. The President has announced
his nomination for D.C. Circuit Court.

841
01:17:09,776 --> 01:17:11,881
I've been asked
to come to the White House.

842
01:17:11,953 --> 01:17:14,920
This court will stand adjourned
until tomorrow morning at 9:30.

843
01:17:19,442 --> 01:17:22,704
Your Honor, what about my continuance?

844
01:17:50,327 --> 01:17:52,367
A juror must have left this glove.

845
01:18:50,466 --> 01:18:52,124
This is where she worked.

846
01:18:52,706 --> 01:18:56,503
My friend said Elizabeth Quinn's section
was putting everything on computer disks.

847
01:18:56,579 --> 01:18:58,237
All the case transcripts.

848
01:18:58,467 --> 01:18:59,415
Okay.

849
01:19:37,578 --> 01:19:39,301
What are you doing on this floor?

850
01:19:39,402 --> 01:19:41,857
Fourteenth is secure.
I thought I could help.

851
01:19:42,091 --> 01:19:43,946
I was the last officer. I already done it.

852
01:19:44,011 --> 01:19:46,499
Get up to the 16th floor
where you're supposed to be.

853
01:19:57,614 --> 01:19:58,661
Eddie.

854
01:20:15,857 --> 01:20:16,423
Shit.

855
01:20:18,321 --> 01:20:19,466
What did you expect?

856
01:20:25,715 --> 01:20:28,748
Something was in there,
and Elizabeth Quinn found it.

857
01:20:29,683 --> 01:20:30,631
I'll find it...

858
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:34,385
...if I have to read every goddamn
transcript from every case in 1968.

859
01:20:34,452 --> 01:20:37,835
-How many cases?
-Over 100.

860
01:20:41,974 --> 01:20:44,974
You know, Paul Gray started out
as a federal prosecutor.

861
01:20:47,735 --> 01:20:50,255
-He ever work here?
-I don't know.

862
01:20:52,311 --> 01:20:53,936
All right, just hold on.

863
01:21:14,171 --> 01:21:17,204
Morty said that Paul Gray prosecuted here
in the late 60s.

864
01:21:17,275 --> 01:21:18,168
Bingo.

865
01:21:18,236 --> 01:21:21,848
What we do is, tomorrow we go
through the cases he prosecuted first.

866
01:21:24,413 --> 01:21:27,642
-Can you get home from here?
-Yeah, I just take the metro.

867
01:21:28,606 --> 01:21:30,461
-I'm the other way.
-All right.

868
01:21:43,841 --> 01:21:44,789
What?

869
01:21:48,994 --> 01:21:50,303
Never mind.

870
01:22:53,196 --> 01:22:55,268
I've read eight cases
that Paul Gray prosecuted.

871
01:22:55,341 --> 01:22:57,129
There's nothing unusual about any of them.

872
01:23:02,574 --> 01:23:06,371
Supreme Court Justice Lowell
was a presiding judge on two of the cases.

873
01:23:11,504 --> 01:23:12,911
When did he kill himself?

874
01:23:14,288 --> 01:23:15,979
December, before Christmas.

875
01:23:19,697 --> 01:23:21,191
What's the connection?

876
01:23:25,394 --> 01:23:27,085
See if you can find me 287.

877
01:26:54,935 --> 01:26:58,415
-What are you doing here?
-I had no place to go.

878
01:26:59,799 --> 01:27:01,686
A friend checked those license numbers...

879
01:27:01,752 --> 01:27:03,540
...to see if any names came up.

880
01:27:04,025 --> 01:27:05,432
Nothing, just names.

881
01:27:05,912 --> 01:27:09,327
413 927: Spencer Lewis.

882
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:13,716
CAN 412: Andrea Duncan.
That's a Maryland plate.

883
01:27:13,786 --> 01:27:16,088
-I know them all by heart.
-I don't care.

884
01:27:16,699 --> 01:27:18,390
-What do you mean?
-I don't care.

885
01:27:18,459 --> 01:27:20,761
I'm tired and I don't care. Good night.

886
01:27:23,099 --> 01:27:25,335
Well, fuck you, too. Good night.

887
01:27:28,797 --> 01:27:30,258
I don't deserve this.

888
01:27:31,357 --> 01:27:34,204
Look, I don't owe you anything.
I don't owe anybody anything.

889
01:27:34,269 --> 01:27:36,408
I'm working for some creep
who's probably guilty.

890
01:27:36,478 --> 01:27:38,038
-Guilty?
-Yeah, that's right, guilty.

891
01:27:38,110 --> 01:27:39,124
It's not complicated.

892
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:41,981
He was hungry, he needed money,
he saw a woman and killed her.

893
01:27:42,079 --> 01:27:44,567
-And Michael, with his throat slit?
-A sick bastard.

894
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:46,427
-What about the files?
-It's all bullshit.

895
01:27:46,496 --> 01:27:50,140
-You don't believe that!
-I'm tired, okay? I want you to go. Now.

896
01:28:09,604 --> 01:28:10,749
Good night.

897
01:28:11,524 --> 01:28:12,451
Ladies and gentlemen...

898
01:28:12,516 --> 01:28:15,778
...it is my responsibility
to insure that these proceedings...

899
01:28:15,845 --> 01:28:18,212
...maintain the highest standards
of integrity.

900
01:28:18,277 --> 01:28:20,546
It came to my attention
there's the possibility...

901
01:28:20,614 --> 01:28:22,621
...of these standards being compromised.

902
01:28:22,694 --> 01:28:24,516
To insure this doesn't happen...

903
01:28:24,583 --> 01:28:27,365
...I'll sequester the jury
for the rest of this trial.

904
01:28:28,071 --> 01:28:31,137
I remind you of your solemn oath
to remain impartial...

905
01:28:31,271 --> 01:28:36,225
...to weigh the evidence and independently
render a verdict of your conscience.

906
01:28:37,097 --> 01:28:40,261
You'll be made as comfortable as possible,
under the circumstances.

907
01:28:40,329 --> 01:28:41,922
I thank you for your perseverance.

908
01:28:43,882 --> 01:28:46,337
Counsel, I expect you
to be the models of propriety...

909
01:28:46,411 --> 01:28:48,680
...for the remainder of this proceeding.

910
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:53,959
Your Honor,
the defense calls Carl Wayne Anderson.

911
01:28:55,148 --> 01:28:57,287
The marshal may remove
Mr. Anderson's handcuffs.

912
01:28:57,644 --> 01:28:59,880
His hands can be free while he testifies...

913
01:28:59,949 --> 01:29:02,437
...so long as he doesn't abuse the privilege.

914
01:29:04,269 --> 01:29:05,796
Thank you, Your Honor.

915
01:29:26,321 --> 01:29:28,361
Please raise your right hand.

916
01:29:29,329 --> 01:29:32,809
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, nothing but the truth...

917
01:29:32,882 --> 01:29:34,638
...so help you God?

918
01:29:35,795 --> 01:29:37,934
For the record,
the witness indicated his assent.

919
01:29:38,004 --> 01:29:39,345
You may be seated.

920
01:29:48,757 --> 01:29:51,059
Please state your full name and address.

921
01:30:11,001 --> 01:30:12,245
Your address?

922
01:30:18,714 --> 01:30:19,794
''None.''

923
01:30:20,283 --> 01:30:21,777
We need a home address, Your Honor.

924
01:30:22,203 --> 01:30:24,625
Make it in care of me,
the public defender's office.

925
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:25,877
Without objection.

926
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:30,774
Mr. Anderson, have you ever killed anyone?

927
01:30:37,438 --> 01:30:38,386
''Yes.''

928
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:39,572
Why?

929
01:30:46,271 --> 01:30:47,580
''I'm not sure.''

930
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,102
You killed someone
and you're not sure why?

931
01:30:55,809 --> 01:30:59,071
''I was in Vietnam. I was 19.''

932
01:31:00,258 --> 01:31:01,599
So you were a soldier.

933
01:31:01,666 --> 01:31:05,179
It was your job to kill. You did your job.
You didn't need a reason.

934
01:31:05,731 --> 01:31:08,065
Carl, do you think you needed a reason?

935
01:31:13,188 --> 01:31:14,136
''Yes.''

936
01:31:14,596 --> 01:31:17,858
The fact is, it upset you so much
that you had a breakdown.

937
01:31:18,053 --> 01:31:20,355
You were discharged
for psychiatric reasons...

938
01:31:20,421 --> 01:31:22,755
...and spent six years
in a veterans hospital.

939
01:31:22,822 --> 01:31:26,564
All because you were a good soldier
who thought he needed a reason to kill.

940
01:31:28,487 --> 01:31:29,796
What were your dreams?

941
01:31:34,632 --> 01:31:37,349
Your dreams. When you were young,
what did you want to be?

942
01:31:42,185 --> 01:31:43,526
''A carpenter...

943
01:31:44,042 --> 01:31:46,562
''...and build my own house.''

944
01:31:49,162 --> 01:31:50,569
And were you ever in love?

945
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:01,031
''I loved Caroline.''

946
01:32:02,093 --> 01:32:03,369
Who was Caroline?

947
01:32:06,605 --> 01:32:07,553
''My wife.''

948
01:32:08,365 --> 01:32:10,437
Did you and Caroline plan to have children?

949
01:32:18,256 --> 01:32:19,979
''We talked about it.''

950
01:32:20,112 --> 01:32:21,606
And what happened?

951
01:32:30,449 --> 01:32:31,943
''We were divorced.''

952
01:32:32,370 --> 01:32:33,318
Why?

953
01:32:40,948 --> 01:32:42,442
''After the sickness...

954
01:32:43,124 --> 01:32:44,749
''...I had nothing left...

955
01:32:47,701 --> 01:32:49,010
''...to offer her.''

956
01:32:52,758 --> 01:32:54,067
It's been rough.

957
01:32:55,318 --> 01:32:57,074
You've had your share of problems.

958
01:32:57,142 --> 01:32:59,346
You've been kicked around pretty good.

959
01:33:01,367 --> 01:33:03,538
Are we supposed to feel sorry for you?

960
01:33:05,144 --> 01:33:09,039
Plenty of people have problems.
Plenty of people get kicked around.

961
01:33:09,528 --> 01:33:12,245
You know the difference
between you and them?

962
01:33:12,729 --> 01:33:14,704
They still have their dignity.

963
01:33:15,802 --> 01:33:18,933
They don't sleep in the gutter.
They don't eat out of garbage cans.

964
01:33:19,002 --> 01:33:22,799
They don't urinate on people's lawns.
They take showers, change their clothes.

965
01:33:22,875 --> 01:33:24,762
They don't feel sorry for themselves.

966
01:33:24,827 --> 01:33:28,405
They get married, they have children.
They take responsibility for their life.

967
01:33:28,508 --> 01:33:32,851
They don't sleep in other people's cars.
They don't steal $9.00 from anyone!

968
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:38,940
Did you kill Elizabeth Rose Quinn?

969
01:33:59,713 --> 01:34:01,720
Your witness.

970
01:34:12,227 --> 01:34:14,267
That was a wonderful performance.

971
01:34:14,884 --> 01:34:17,983
The man shouldn't be on trial,
he should be given a medal.

972
01:34:18,917 --> 01:34:22,430
You were discharged from the army
for psychiatric reasons, is that right?

973
01:34:29,574 --> 01:34:30,522
''Yes.''

974
01:34:30,599 --> 01:34:32,901
Did you beat your superior officer
with a shovel...

975
01:34:32,967 --> 01:34:36,164
...because he asked you to dig a trench?
Was that one of the reasons?

976
01:34:42,248 --> 01:34:43,109
''Yes.''

977
01:34:44,393 --> 01:34:46,465
Violence seems to follow you
wherever you go.

978
01:34:46,537 --> 01:34:48,544
-Objection, Your Honor.
-Sustained.

979
01:34:54,411 --> 01:34:56,680
Were you arrested in 1978...

980
01:34:57,163 --> 01:35:00,425
...for assaulting a congressional aide
on Constitution Avenue?

981
01:35:02,668 --> 01:35:03,561
''Yes.''

982
01:35:03,628 --> 01:35:07,490
And were you in the District of Columbia
jail for six months for beating a man?

983
01:35:13,710 --> 01:35:15,270
''He stole my shoe.''

984
01:35:15,919 --> 01:35:18,407
Did you punch your own attorney
in the face when she--

985
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:20,967
Objection, Your Honor. That's privileged.

986
01:35:21,359 --> 01:35:23,115
I'll withdraw the question.

987
01:35:27,953 --> 01:35:31,914
You were in the parking lot on K Street
the night of December 18?

988
01:35:35,890 --> 01:35:36,783
''Yes.''

989
01:35:38,739 --> 01:35:42,252
And you did break into
Elizabeth Quinn's car?

990
01:35:48,789 --> 01:35:51,058
-''It was cold.''
-Just yes or no, please.

991
01:35:51,124 --> 01:35:53,458
Your counsel has given us
enough explanation.

992
01:35:53,525 --> 01:35:54,670
Objection, Your Honor.

993
01:35:54,869 --> 01:35:56,210
Could we proceed?

994
01:35:58,710 --> 01:36:01,776
Did the parking lot attendant
throw you off the lot?

995
01:36:07,607 --> 01:36:08,534
''Yes.''

996
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:11,088
But you came back, just before midnight?

997
01:36:13,529 --> 01:36:14,477
''Yes.''

998
01:36:14,553 --> 01:36:17,869
You attacked Elizabeth Quinn there
and dragged her down to the river?

999
01:36:19,290 --> 01:36:20,272
''No.''

1000
01:36:20,986 --> 01:36:24,369
You were at the Potomac River
after midnight, weren't you?

1001
01:36:30,332 --> 01:36:32,568
''I was looking for wood--''

1002
01:36:32,636 --> 01:36:34,359
Just yes or no, please.

1003
01:36:41,565 --> 01:36:42,513
''Yes.''

1004
01:36:43,806 --> 01:36:47,122
Elizabeth was there. You were there.

1005
01:36:47,774 --> 01:36:50,676
Her purse was stolen. You had her purse.

1006
01:36:50,752 --> 01:36:53,883
Her throat was cut! You had a knife!
Those are the naked facts!

1007
01:36:53,952 --> 01:36:55,064
Objection, Your Honor.

1008
01:36:55,136 --> 01:36:58,780
Perhaps Mr. Stella would wait till the end
to make his closing argument.

1009
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:01,077
Sustained.

1010
01:37:04,642 --> 01:37:07,064
Ms. Riley has the gift of speech.

1011
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:10,778
I'll let the facts speak for themselves.

1012
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:18,073
How did you expect us to believe
you didn't kill her?

1013
01:37:24,581 --> 01:37:27,003
No further questions at this time,
Your Honor.

1014
01:39:46,430 --> 01:39:49,746
-Hey, lady, what do you think you're doing?
-I was her friend.

1015
01:40:08,418 --> 01:40:09,879
I'm sorry to bother you at home.

1016
01:40:10,242 --> 01:40:12,762
That's all right,
although this is highly irregular.

1017
01:40:12,835 --> 01:40:15,682
I have evidence that will,
if not prove my client innocent...

1018
01:40:15,747 --> 01:40:17,372
...at least necessitate a mistrial.

1019
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:21,853
Excuse me, Matthew.
May I use your phone?

1020
01:40:22,244 --> 01:40:24,862
Deputy Attorney General Paul Gray,
Miss Kathleen Riley.

1021
01:40:24,932 --> 01:40:27,834
Miss Riley is the public defender
in the Elizabeth Quinn trial.

1022
01:40:27,909 --> 01:40:29,502
Miss Quinn worked in my department.

1023
01:40:29,573 --> 01:40:31,613
I've followed the trial with great interest.

1024
01:40:31,686 --> 01:40:35,101
Miss Riley feels she has evidence
which will exculpate her client.

1025
01:40:36,102 --> 01:40:38,306
-The phone?
-There's one in the study.

1026
01:40:38,407 --> 01:40:40,032
No, don't bother, Matthew.

1027
01:40:40,424 --> 01:40:42,115
Nice to meet you, Miss Riley.

1028
01:40:48,649 --> 01:40:49,925
Yes, what is this evidence?

1029
01:40:50,409 --> 01:40:52,384
Your Honor, I feel that I've behaved rashly.

1030
01:40:52,458 --> 01:40:55,458
I should present the evidence properly
tomorrow in court.

1031
01:40:55,530 --> 01:40:56,991
This is somewhat erratic, isn't it?

1032
01:40:57,386 --> 01:41:00,702
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I've been under tremendous strain lately.

1033
01:41:01,035 --> 01:41:04,199
This behavior is bordering
on professional misconduct, Miss Riley.

1034
01:41:06,796 --> 01:41:09,665
Mathew? I'm sorry,
there's a problem I have to take care of.

1035
01:41:09,741 --> 01:41:11,781
My regards to your wife.
Thanks for the evening.

1036
01:41:11,853 --> 01:41:13,893
-Let me show you out.
-Don't bother.

1037
01:42:03,798 --> 01:42:06,864
<i>This is Justice Charles F. Lowell.</i>

1038
01:42:08,151 --> 01:42:12,690
<i>For 20 years I've lived with this burden,</i>
<i>always expecting exposure...</i>

1039
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:16,851
<i>...from a law student,</i>
<i>a legal scholar, or a colleague.</i>

1040
01:42:18,424 --> 01:42:21,457
<i>Elizabeth Rose Quinn,</i>
<i>a clerk at the Justice Department...</i>

1041
01:42:21,529 --> 01:42:26,319
<i>...unfamiliar with the law,</i>
<i>recognized the injustice of the decision...</i>

1042
01:42:26,938 --> 01:42:30,713
<i>...in United States vs. Cook</i>
<i>and came to me.</i>

1043
01:42:32,507 --> 01:42:37,014
<i>More than the fear of exposure,</i>
<i>I've had to live with myself.</i>

1044
01:42:38,812 --> 01:42:41,627
<i>It's a terrible price to pay for ambition.</i>

1045
01:42:43,933 --> 01:42:45,689
<i>In 1968...</i>

1046
01:42:45,789 --> 01:42:49,335
<i>...while I was the presiding judge</i>
<i>on the case of United States vs. Cook...</i>

1047
01:42:49,406 --> 01:42:52,123
<i>...in the Federal Court,</i>
<i>Washington District...</i>

1048
01:42:52,479 --> 01:42:54,781
...<i>I conspired to fix the case.</i>

1049
01:42:55,679 --> 01:42:59,509
<i>I accepted a bribe.</i>
<i>In exchange for an appointment...</i>

1050
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:02,202
<i>...to a seat</i>
<i>on the United States Circuit Court.</i>

1051
01:43:03,072 --> 01:43:08,157
<i>I dismissed all charges of vote fraud</i>
<i>against a politically influential defendant.</i>

1052
01:43:09,794 --> 01:43:13,569
<i>Miss Quinn has contacted the others</i>
<i>that were involved.</i>

1053
01:43:14,819 --> 01:43:16,958
<i>I leave them to their consciences.</i>

1054
01:43:17,987 --> 01:43:20,409
<i>I will make my peace somewhere else.</i>

1055
01:43:21,316 --> 01:43:25,691
<i>I have asked Elizabeth Quinn</i>
<i>to make this public after my death.</i>

1056
01:43:26,308 --> 01:43:29,341
<i>This is my last small measure of justice.</i>

1057
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:39,685
To fix a case, you've got to have a judge
who's willing to go along.

1058
01:43:40,231 --> 01:43:42,500
You've got to have
a very influential defendant...

1059
01:43:42,567 --> 01:43:45,950
...a politic defense attorney,
and a corrupt prosecutor.

1060
01:43:49,352 --> 01:43:50,693
United States vs. Cook.

1061
01:43:50,793 --> 01:43:53,379
That must be one of the cases
I didn't get to.

1062
01:43:53,481 --> 01:43:56,350
I'm willing to bet you
Paul Gray was the prosecuting attorney.

1063
01:43:56,426 --> 01:43:57,702
You realize you're accusing...

1064
01:43:57,770 --> 01:44:01,032
...the Deputy Attorney General
of the United States of murder.

1065
01:44:01,547 --> 01:44:04,896
I had the federal supplement here.
I must have left it at the courthouse.

1066
01:44:04,971 --> 01:44:06,116
I'll see you.

1067
01:44:23,023 --> 01:44:24,550
Hey, what's going on?

1068
01:44:24,655 --> 01:44:25,964
Sounds like a fire alarm.

1069
01:44:26,319 --> 01:44:28,206
Is this for real or what?

1070
01:44:29,359 --> 01:44:30,341
Is this for real?

1071
01:44:30,416 --> 01:44:32,521
Madam, close the door, please.

1072
01:44:32,784 --> 01:44:35,915
Please. Stay together.

1073
01:44:37,169 --> 01:44:39,111
It's just a fire alarm.

1074
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:58,002
-Is this the public defender's office?
<i>-Yes.</i>

1075
01:44:58,324 --> 01:44:59,633
Is Kathleen Riley there?

1076
01:44:59,701 --> 01:45:01,359
<i>She's gone over to the courthouse.</i>

1077
01:45:01,429 --> 01:45:03,851
<i>She'll be back shortly.</i>
<i>Could I take a message?</i>

1078
01:45:04,054 --> 01:45:05,777
Would you--

1079
01:45:06,230 --> 01:45:07,178
Never mind, thank you.

1080
01:49:22,403 --> 01:49:23,744
Kathleen!

1081
01:49:38,374 --> 01:49:39,618
It's all right.

1082
01:49:41,030 --> 01:49:45,919
All rise. The court for
the District of Columbia is now in session.

1083
01:49:45,991 --> 01:49:48,926
The Honorable
Judge Matthew Bishop Helms presiding.

1084
01:49:49,672 --> 01:49:54,375
Please be seated and come to order.
The court calls forward the matter...

1085
01:49:54,441 --> 01:49:57,092
...of the United States
vs. Carl Wayne Anderson.

1086
01:49:58,601 --> 01:50:02,595
-We were going to begin redirect.
-The defense has no redirect.

1087
01:50:05,194 --> 01:50:07,583
-Mr. Gray?
-Defense called me to appear, Your Honor.

1088
01:50:07,819 --> 01:50:09,226
I wasn't aware of any subpoena.

1089
01:50:09,579 --> 01:50:13,474
I've come under advisement of counsel
on my own volition. To hear charges.

1090
01:50:14,092 --> 01:50:17,769
We would like to thank the Deputy
Attorney General for his compliance.

1091
01:50:20,973 --> 01:50:22,020
Approach the bench.

1092
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,010
Why wasn't I informed of this?

1093
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:38,731
The defense has the prerogative
to call vital witnesses.

1094
01:50:38,896 --> 01:50:41,711
-Don't lecture me on the law, Miss Riley.
-I'm sorry.

1095
01:50:42,193 --> 01:50:43,884
-Do you have other witnesses?
-Yes, I do.

1096
01:50:43,953 --> 01:50:45,294
-Are they present?
-Yes.

1097
01:50:45,361 --> 01:50:47,270
-You may call your first witness.
-Thank you.

1098
01:50:52,883 --> 01:50:54,738
Your Honor,
we call Your Honor to the stand.

1099
01:50:57,139 --> 01:50:59,757
What's the meaning of this?
I can't be called to the stand.

1100
01:50:59,828 --> 01:51:01,999
You have knowledge
that is vital to our case.

1101
01:51:02,068 --> 01:51:03,213
Counsel, approach the bench.

1102
01:51:03,284 --> 01:51:05,870
I'll have a subpoena issued
to compel you to testify.

1103
01:51:05,941 --> 01:51:08,275
Approach the bench
or you'll be in contempt of court.

1104
01:51:08,341 --> 01:51:10,992
-I can't be compelled to testify.
-You're not above the law.

1105
01:51:11,126 --> 01:51:13,515
If you persist,
I'll be forced to call a mistrial.

1106
01:51:13,590 --> 01:51:17,714
Mr. Helms, were you the federal prosecutor
on the United States vs. Cook trial 1968?

1107
01:51:17,784 --> 01:51:19,213
This trial is a mistrial.

1108
01:51:19,288 --> 01:51:22,321
Did you conspire with
District Court Judge Charles F. Lowell...

1109
01:51:22,392 --> 01:51:25,261
...to dismiss that case
for his appointment to a higher court...

1110
01:51:25,368 --> 01:51:28,335
-...and an appointment to your seat?
-You're in contempt of court.

1111
01:51:28,409 --> 01:51:31,027
Did you wait 17 years
while lesser men passed you by?

1112
01:51:31,097 --> 01:51:33,780
Watching lesser men
get appointments to a higher court.

1113
01:51:33,850 --> 01:51:34,832
I'll have you disbarred!

1114
01:51:34,906 --> 01:51:37,077
An appointment to the Circuit Court...

1115
01:51:37,146 --> 01:51:38,837
...a step away from the Supreme Court...

1116
01:51:38,907 --> 01:51:41,460
...did your past haunt you?
Did you strike it and kill it?

1117
01:51:41,532 --> 01:51:42,612
Remove her from the court!

1118
01:51:42,684 --> 01:51:45,139
Did you willfully plan
and murder Elizabeth Quinn...

1119
01:51:45,212 --> 01:51:47,000
...when she approached you
with your past?

1120
01:51:47,068 --> 01:51:51,291
Remove Miss Riley from this court.
Miss Riley, you're in contempt of court.

1121
01:51:51,357 --> 01:51:54,554
I'll have you disbarred.
Remove Miss Riley from this court.

1122
01:51:54,654 --> 01:51:57,207
-Was your car, license number...
-Remove Miss Riley!

1123
01:51:57,310 --> 01:52:01,566
...6F9 587, in the parking lot on K Street
on the night of December 18?

1124
01:52:01,951 --> 01:52:05,945
Did you wait, and when Elizabeth Quinn
arrived at her car, did you beat her...

1125
01:52:06,015 --> 01:52:09,146
...drag her down to the river
and savagely cut her throat?

1126
01:52:09,344 --> 01:52:12,061
I've filed charges
with the D.C. Police Department...

1127
01:52:12,129 --> 01:52:15,675
...for the arrest of Matthew Bishop Helms
for murder in the first degree.

1128
01:53:08,747 --> 01:53:10,819
-Congratulations, Kathleen.
-Thanks.

1129
01:53:32,751 --> 01:53:35,085
All of a sudden I have nothing to do.

1130
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:39,080
I have to be in court in an hour.

1131
01:53:40,464 --> 01:53:44,687
A guy on the jury was a jeweler.
I had him check out that cuff link.

1132
01:53:45,649 --> 01:53:48,267
It turned out to be gold-plated.
Just garbage.

1133
01:53:48,753 --> 01:53:50,160
I know. I told you so.

1134
01:53:50,226 --> 01:53:52,266
Yeah, I thought you would say that.

1135
01:53:52,754 --> 01:53:55,623
-What can we do for an hour?
-Leave the door open.

1136
01:53:57,172 --> 01:53:58,317
Let go.

1137
01:53:59,305 --> 01:54:05,697
