00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,436
NOT LONG AGO, IN THE UNEXPLORED
REACHES OF AN UNMAPPED SWAMP,

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,791
THE CREATIVE GENIUS OF ONE MAN

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,314
COLLIDED WITH ANOTHER'S EVIL
DREAM AND A MONSTER WAS BORN.

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:44,271
TOO POWERFUL TO BE DESTRO YED,
TOO INTELLIGENT TO BE CAPTURED,

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,916
THIS BEING
STILL PURSUES ITS SAVAGE DREAM.

8
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,795
So there's the swamp.
Where's the nearest good restaurant?

9
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,230
Depends. If you're a human,
it's back in Washington.

10
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,512
But if you're a 'gator,
could be right where we land.

11
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,236
Thank your lucky stars
you're comin' in at the end of this.

12
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,316
Holland insisted on building it all out here.
He said this is where the life is.

13
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,955
One of those life forms
nailed the guy you're replacing.

14
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,672
What? They sent a woman out here?

15
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,519
- Where are you goin'?
- Couldn't take it any more.

16
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,154
Well, he lasted longer than most.

17
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,152
<i>(radio crackles)</i>

18
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,035
Boo.

19
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,194
<i>(snake hisses)</i>

20
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,269
No!

21
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,029
Weird, isn't it? The local fishermen
say this place is haunted.

22
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,357
I don't know where we are, Toto,
but this sure isn't Kansas.

23
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,993
What?

24
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,599
Nothing.

25
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,758
Used to be a church until
about 50 years ago, then the levee broke.

26
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,839
It's just been us and the deer flies
for the last ten weeks.

27
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,394
Welcome back, sir.
What did Washington say?

28
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,839
That's confidential.

29
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,111
- <i>(man)</i> It's OK, Miss. I got it.
- But you can start packin'.

30
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,719
All right.

31
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,156
<i>(man)</i> Where's this go?
Give me a hand over here with this.

32
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,192
What does Holland think
about going back to Washington?

33
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,438
I doubt he's been told. Ritter couldn't
believe me when I gave him the news.

34
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,236
- Do you think Washington's paranoid?
- Do you think the Pope is Catholic?

35
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,510
This is your place.

36
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,351
You probably haven't seen half this stuff.
It's all new. This is a laser...

37
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,554
Laser-induced subsonic field generator.
Gives double readings in the 3200 band.

38
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,272
I got a trick for fixing that.

39
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,710
They send someone who knows what
she's doin' the week they pull us out!

40
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,909
What's he working on?

41
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,473
- Who?
- Holland.

42
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,752
This thing is so hush-hush, no one asks.
Something to do with plants.

43
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,553
<i>(man)</i> Where the hell's my man?
I thought he was back.

44
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,477
Hey, Charlie!

45
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,319
The emperor calls. Come on.

46
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,516
Hey, you know there's a...

47
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,112
What's going on here?
Get those crates into the church.

48
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,710
You men in the boat! What are you doing?
Get that damn thing outta sight!

49
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,159
Lamebrains!

50
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,238
Charlie, welcome back.
And this is Hank's replacement?

51
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,079
Cable, Harry Ritter,
Project Field Supervisor.

52
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,509
One of your sensors
is reading malfunction.

53
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,393
Not surprising.
They rot in a week in these swamps.

54
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,557
Charlie, did you get them
to change their minds?

55
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,309
No. They want him and the substance
in Washington where they can watch him.

56
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,714
Anything wrong?

57
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,072
A rumour. Somebody's heard
Arcane's gotten wind of the project.

58
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,398
- I thought Arcane was dead.
- He is. Who said that Arcane's onto this?

59
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,990
Nobody's taking credit for it.
You know Washington.

60
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,873
All it takes is one loudmouth
to spill this to Holland

61
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,639
and the whole project goes to hell,
do you know that?

62
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,193
Yes, sir.

63
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,470
That goes for you, too.

64
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,471
Come on. I keep the number of people
near to him at a minimum.

65
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,910
This admits the three of us,
and the Hollands.

66
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,476
It was programmed for your prints
this morning. Try it.

67
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,198
The stuff I have put up with - alligators,
bugs, snakes, and now rumours.

68
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,314
Charlie, I want to hear everything
about the Arcane business, now.

69
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,756
What about that sensor in sector three?

70
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,269
Get somebody to take you there
and take a look.

71
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,470
Me?

72
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,670
In the swamps?

73
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,913
- Any luck there?
- Wiggle your fingers.

74
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,637
Lose a contact lens?

75
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,557
Funny.

76
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,071
Well, don't just stand there.
Give us a hand. Right about in the middle.

77
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,110
Please?

78
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,791
I dropped a Cooper's digger.

79
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,593
Would you look under the rocks, please?

80
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,119
Go ahead.

81
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,070
What's a Cooper's digger? A shovel?

82
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,428
Nah...

83
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,756
Just Alessandro.

84
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,470
He's got a little one-celled animal living
in his fur that makes a terrific host.

85
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,831
Terrific. I'll remember that
the next time I throw a party.

86
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,758
Oh, not bad. Not bad.

87
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,508
- You don't have to be crazy around him...
- But it helps?

88
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,428
Alice Cable, new kid on the block.
You part of Holland's crew?

89
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,755
I'm Linda Holland.

90
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,154
<i>You're</i> Dr Holland.

91
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,034
I'm <i>a</i> Dr Holland, but not <i>the</i> Dr Holland,
boy genius and oddball.

92
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,755
That's Alec. He's the brains.
I just cook up what he invents.

93
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,838
Don't believe her.
She's got an IQ like a phone number.

94
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,670
I want you to run up a variation on the
formula with the host on Alessandro's fur.

95
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,233
OK.

96
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,396
Hello. I understand you have a sensor out.
Do you wanna go out and take a look?

97
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,510
Well, I guess I could ask Charlie
to give us an escort.

98
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,837
We could ask your mother
to come along, too. Come on.

99
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,192
The only dangerous thing out there is the
government agents with their popguns.

100
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,959
It's your first day.
I'll take you on a Cook's tour.

101
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:50,154
Ritter's always after me
to get some fresh air. He'll be tickled pink.

102
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,032
What do you say?

103
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,916
Oh, man.

104
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,318
You look like a tree.

105
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,271
Sometimes I feel like a tree.

106
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,358
- Like the swamps?
- Hate the swamps. Hate bugs.

107
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,790
- Hate things without legs.
- A neatness freak, huh?

108
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,549
- You could eat off my kitchen floor.
- You could eat off the swamps.

109
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,399
Maybe half the world
could eat off the swamps.

110
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,159
More than likely,
the swamps will eat off us.

111
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,714
Like, what happened
to the guy I'm replacing?

112
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,073
The 'gator was only following his
natural way. Can't blame a guy for that.

113
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,394
I paid a fortune for these boots.

114
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,149
You'd better keep movin'.
There's quicksand around here.

115
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,316
- Keep your eyes open, too.
- For what?

116
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,955
One of these just might
jump out and do you in.

117
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,594
There's over 100 species
of genus <i>orchis</i> here.

118
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,315
So much beauty in the swamps,
if you open up your eyes to it.

119
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,115
Take a look into your own body,
one of God's most magnificent creations,

120
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,309
and what do you see?

121
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,796
Straight lines and deodorant,
chrome and Formica? No, no, no.

122
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,436
You see blood and bone, pump and flow,
and a million messy miracles.

123
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,518
Look at the most creative thing
man and woman can do together

124
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,076
and you'll see
something growing, unpredictable,

125
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,350
magical, hot.

126
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,634
Save the malarkey for your wife, Holland.

127
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,638
If you don't mind,
where the hell's the sensor?

128
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,716
It's right over there.

129
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,476
Looks OK to me.

130
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,636
Here, let me help.

131
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,036
<i>(rattles)</i>

132
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,672
Well, it doesn't look OK to me.

133
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,677
- Let's get back.
- All right.

134
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,796
Charlie?

135
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,836
Charlie!

136
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,395
Cable, what the hell is your story?

137
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,909
Anything suspicious happen
while we were gone?

138
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,713
You're damn right.
Something suspicious <i>did</i> happen.

139
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,718
A stupid broad of an agent,
first day on the job,

140
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,709
takes a scientist we're supposed
to be guarding for a romp in the bush.

141
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,957
- Hold it. Just cool it.
- You think you're on a picnic?

142
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,436
Wait. It was my idea to take her out there.
She was doin' her job.

143
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,279
- Why do you have to be so worried?
- It's my job to worry.

144
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,234
And if I have my way, you'll be
on the next chopper back to Washington.

145
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,477
A woman has no place
around a guy like you.

146
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,151
There's a cut sensor out there.

147
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,350
- Which sector?
- Sector three.

148
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,517
Hank was working on that
when he was bitten by the 'gator.

149
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,236
He didn't put it all back together again
before we took him to the hospital.

150
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,668
- "Tickled pink", huh?
- I'm really sorry, Cable.

151
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,512
Well, I guess you can't be blamed
for following your natural way.

152
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,033
Did either of you see
one of our guys out there? Ronnie?

153
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,392
- No. Why?
- We seem to have lost contact with him.

154
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,238
<i>(explosion)</i>

155
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,475
- Linda, are you all right?
- It's OK, it's OK.

156
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,157
The damnedest thing.

157
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,273
You know this new batch you had me
cook up with the host from Alessandro?

158
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:08,155
I knew we were up to something
revolutionary, but this is dynamite.

159
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,474
Watch.

160
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,190
- Incredible.
- Weird, huh?

161
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,595
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

162
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,748
You've managed to reinvent nitro. Let's
hope this project doesn't end with a bang.

163
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,395
Come on, Charlie, please.
I gotta write this down.

164
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,353
I <i>thought</i> you were
working on a weapons system.

165
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,074
- I knew it wasn't just plants.
- Plants, plants.

166
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,192
The only way I thought my work
would be explosive was socially.

167
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,356
It's never been this volatile before.

168
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,393
Linda, prep a sample of that
for the electron microscope, please.

169
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,354
- And be very careful with it.
- What is it you've been doing here?

170
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,277
Come over here. I'll show you.

171
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,510
You see those little guys?

172
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,359
DNA chromosomes
from the common lab bacilli <i>E. coli.</i>

173
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,349
Now, you see that one? Another simple
bacilli. Plant matrix called D complex.

174
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,076
Each of these organisms have existed in
the labs for years, but always separately,

175
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,509
since one is animal, the other's vegetable.

176
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,791
This is what we've developed
over the last couple of months.

177
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,835
See that little guy? Never existed on the
face of the earth before. That's my baby.

178
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,351
A simple vegetable cell with
an unmistakable animal nucleus.

179
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,596
Recombinant DNA?

180
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,472
Hey, that's very good.

181
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:44,119
I am very close to developing a plant with
an animal's aggressive power for survival.

182
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,878
A plant for the 21st century.

183
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,389
You want watermelons
the size of weather balloons

184
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,839
or tomatoes that'll fetch a stick?

185
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,511
Or a tomato that could grow in the desert.
Or soybeans that could thrive in Biafra.

186
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,234
Or corn that could grow in the USA
in the year 2001,

187
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,875
when there'll be 6.5 billion people
on this planet, all of them hungry.

188
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,913
- How you doin' there, Linda?
- It's all set. Vector 3379.

189
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,917
OK.

190
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,194
- It's replicating like mad.
- It certainly is.

191
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,433
Let's try it on something.

192
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,553
Cable, would you bring that flask of water
over here, please?

193
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,069
Thank you.

194
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,478
If it would work on plants the way
you want it to, what will it do to people?

195
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,912
- And what if it falls into wrong hands?
- Arcane boogieman mentality, huh?

196
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,952
OK, now we begin. 2000 water,

197
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,835
one part formula.

198
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,236
2000 water, 6.30 March 20th.

199
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,990
How long before you'll know?

200
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,998
What do you want it to do,
jump out and dance a fandango?

201
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,590
I don't know.
A week maybe, maybe longer.

202
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,395
This has all the thrills
of watching grass grow.

203
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,830
Aren't there some sensors
you could be working on?

204
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,155
Oops.

205
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,195
Forget it. He's just ridiculously sensitive.
Our dad was the same.

206
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,389
Your dad?

207
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,796
You've never heard of Walter Holland
the biophysicist?

208
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,959
Nobel prize. He used to throw
a mean Bunsen burner, I can tell you.

209
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,153
Alec and I spent half our childhood
cleaning up after his tantrums.

210
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,636
Perfectionist to the day he died.
Alec's the same.

211
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,589
- Oh, my God.
- What is that?

212
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,075
Cable, I don't believe this.

213
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,637
All the places that Linda dropped
the formula, the boards grew.

214
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,910
- Who are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

215
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,916
Alec...

216
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,510
Linda! Get in here quick!

217
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,757
This is fantastic. This is incredible.

218
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,951
Oh...

219
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,910
Alec, the formula?

220
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,270
Ritter. He's got to be told right away.

221
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,075
I wanna see that bastard's face
when he realises we've done it.

222
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,595
Ritter?

223
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,075
Ritter?

224
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,434
- You guys seen Ritter?
- He's in the command shed.

225
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,516
Thanks.

226
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,436
Ritter!

227
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,552
Charlie...

228
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,119
Get up!

229
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,834
Hold it!

230
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,838
- I'm holding.
- It's over, lady.

231
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,910
- Arcane, right?
- Shut up.

232
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,996
Alec, watch out!

233
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,270
- Very interesting, Dr Holland.
- On your feet.

234
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,469
- Who are you?
- Interesting.

235
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,036
Now, I know I haven't seen
anything like this before.

236
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,273
Have you?

237
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,868
What the hell do you want?

238
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,959
I represent a certain party
that's interested in your formula.

239
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,071
He'd give an arm and a leg for it.

240
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,634
<i>Your</i> arm and leg, if necessary.

241
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,591
Get outta my lab! Get out!

242
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,755
Alec!

243
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,996
What's the hold-up?

244
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,079
He's being difficult.

245
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,953
No, Ritter. Not you.

246
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,159
No, Dr Holland, not Ritter.

247
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,716
Ritter, poor fellow, is long dead.

248
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,037
You have heard of but never seen me,
so I will introduce myself.

249
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,318
My name is Arcane.

250
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,789
Linda, come here. Here.

251
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,115
Leave her alone.

252
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,038
Thank you.

253
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,358
All materials pertaining
to the substance, now,

254
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,879
or she dies.

255
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,959
What sort of rejuvenation
will you be able to perform on her then?

256
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,750
- Don't, Alec.
- It's all right.

257
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,915
The actual solution as well.

258
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,798
Linda!

259
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,831
Linda! Linda...

260
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:44,034
What is best for you is not
to be born, not to be, to be nothing.

261
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,392
But the second best for you
is to die soon. Nietzsche.

262
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,118
- The notebooks.
- I never seen anything like that.

263
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,350
The notebooks, good.

264
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,834
Strip it. No bodies.

265
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,428
No witnesses.

266
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,197
No survivors. No trace of them.

267
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,390
You, come here. Burn the papers.

268
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,909
Burn everything. Come on, get a move on.

269
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,397
Somebody help Bruno with the bodies.
I want this place clean by dawn.

270
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,229
- Is that the last of 'em?
- That's it.

271
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,510
Then get the lead out.

272
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,550
- A final check, then vacate the premises.
- Right. Take that to the boat.

273
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,754
Hurry it up.

274
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,077
Wait a minute.
I'm finding lots of stuff down here.

275
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,394
What kind of stuff?

276
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,433
A little of this, a little of that.
Come on down and take a look.

277
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,195
What you got?

278
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,596
- Found some money, a watch, and...
- No, this.

279
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,029
Oh, that. I took it off the girl.

280
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,596
You can have it. Ain't worth nothin'
compared to the watches.

281
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,280
Get out in front.
We're getting out of here.

282
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,796
Ferret?

283
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,795
Plannin' on goin' somewhere?

284
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,832
Come on, let's take a little walk.

285
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,915
Bastard!

286
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,396
My, haven't you gotten dirty?
My goodness!

287
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,829
Tyrone, come here.

288
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,669
I think this lady needs a bath.
Let's take her down to the dock.

289
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,074
Where'd she come from?

290
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,553
Help!

291
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,474
Help!

292
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,556
Get the boat ready.

293
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,399
Move it. We don't have all day,
and I wanna teach this lady how to swim.

294
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,988
The first lesson's called the Dead Man's...

295
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,599
Ow!

296
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,630
You wanna play rough, huh?

297
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,674
Say hello to your boyfriend, baby.

298
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,075
What the hell was that?

299
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,317
Willie! Tyrone! shoot the damn thing.

300
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,993
Get it! Kill it - and her!

301
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,951
You, too!

302
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,196
Back in the swamps.

303
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,958
Willie, go that way.
Tyrone, cover that area.

304
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,109
<i>(cough)</i>

305
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,959
So long, baby.

306
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,516
Willie?

307
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,910
Flank right.

308
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,832
No, no, no! What are you doin?

309
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,509
What the hell are you doin', Danny?

310
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,111
Spread out.

311
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,708
Keep your head.

312
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,199
- Where's Danny?
- Where's Willie?

313
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,357
- Maybe Willie's with Tyrone.
- Danny shot Tyrone.

314
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,276
Oh, yeah.

315
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,277
<i>(roaring)</i>

316
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,071
- Maybe we should...
- Get the hell outta here.

317
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,150
The work with DNA, I expected.

318
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,990
But the combining
of plant and animal is astonishing.

319
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,596
Astonishing.

320
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,669
- You should sleep, sir.
- I can't.

321
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,873
It was all so near,
right there in the palm of my hand, and...

322
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,676
But it's lovely not to sleep,

323
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,077
knowing that I'll soon
make the substance for myself.

324
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,236
Have some coffee, sir.

325
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,316
Thank you.

326
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,911
Holland had great talent.

327
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,952
But talent does only what it can.

328
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,995
Genius does what it must.

329
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:12,159
It is master of man, power absolute.

330
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,308
And in your hands, sir, how magnificent.

331
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,879
- How beautiful.
- Yes.

332
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,234
The world will bow, or starve.

333
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,153
Yes.

334
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,629
Yes.

335
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,117
Four, five, six.

336
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,479
- How many notebooks were there?
- Six, I think.

337
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,037
But six ends with notes two weeks old.

338
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,549
It's unfinished.

339
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,639
There must be another,
a seventh notebook.

340
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,590
Ferret has just radioed, sir.
Something's happened.

341
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,312
What?

342
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,192
Something about a...

343
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,471
Well, you'd better
speak to him yourself, sir.

344
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,237
<i>(roar)</i>

345
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,429
- What?
- You're not gonna believe this.

346
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,949
Something incredible
came out of the swamps.

347
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,513
What came out of the swamps?

348
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,473
Some kind of animal or something.
It got the men.

349
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,433
We wouldn't be here
if it hadn't gone after the girl.

350
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,670
Girl? You mean you let her get away?

351
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,430
Uh-huh, here comes trouble.

352
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,673
Hi.

353
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,868
You in a plane crash?

354
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,116
Just been out walkin'.

355
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,071
Uh-huh.

356
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,555
You got a phone that works?

357
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,754
<i>(woman) Operations.</i>

358
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,838
This is 5-17. Operation Mount Pisba.

359
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,315
Get me my next immediate superior,
and hurry.

360
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,557
<i>Hold on. I'm putting you through to Ritter.</i>

361
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,353
- I think he's been neutrali...
- <i>(click)</i>

362
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,758
<i>(buzz)</i>

363
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,430
Yes?

364
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,836
<i>This is mobile operator 3-4.</i>
<i>I have an emergency call for you.</i>

365
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,951
Put the call through.

366
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,073
<i>Ritter, this is Cable.</i>
<i>We've had a catastrophe out here.</i>

367
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,030
What happened?

368
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,357
<i>There was a hit on the compound.</i>
<i>Holland's dead. The lab's gone.</i>

369
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,870
<i>- I thought they got you, too.</i>
- Uh, no, I was called away.

370
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,551
<i>I think you were wrong about Arcane.</i>
<i>They knew what they were looking for...</i>

371
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,877
Hold on, we'll get to you.
You can explain later. Where are you?

372
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,468
A gas station a mile south
of the road to the landing.

373
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,995
Right.

374
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,157
Oh, uh, did you manage to save anything?

375
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,999
Damn right. I got the last notebook.

376
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,669
Very good.
I'll be there before you know it.

377
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,869
Turn around.

378
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,798
- Doesn't anything work around here?
- Just me.

379
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,392
Kickin' it don't help nothin'.
You gotta punch it.

380
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,513
- Thanks.
- Nothin'. Name's Jude.

381
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,119
Cable.

382
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,154
Nice station. Your dad own it?

383
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,509
Look like your ride's got here.

384
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,435
<i>(Ferret)</i> Come on, let's go.

385
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,630
Don't be afraid.

386
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,116
Say that to someone
whose desk you ain't hidin' behind.

387
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,115
Is there a gun here?

388
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,676
What kinda place do you think this is?
Course there is.

389
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,592
Gun's a museum piece.

390
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,948
Stay here.

391
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,912
Took the words right outta my mouth.

392
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,439
Hey, greaseball!

393
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,879
She's mine.

394
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,634
She's got a gun.

395
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,715
Some gun. It blew up on the first shot.

396
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,239
Jam it. Jam it to the floor.

397
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,790
Wait a minute. There she is.

398
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,718
Go, go. Go get her. Go on.

399
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,875
Go on.

400
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,072
Watch the trees.

401
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,431
Go, go. Come on,
she's gainin' ground on you.

402
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,116
Faster.

403
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,874
Got her in the sights.

404
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,155
- It's back! Stop the jeep!
- Run him down.

405
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,429
Don't stop!

406
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,396
Help!

407
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,635
Shoo.

408
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,878
Go!

409
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,989
It's OK, it's OK. It's just me.

410
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,872
Jude, what are you doing here?

411
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,630
You think I'd stay at the station
while they're pumpin' it full of holes?

412
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,070
What happened to that thing?

413
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,475
It, uh...

414
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,114
hit a tree.

415
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:49,553
Must have been one of those hit-and-run
trees. It don't seem to be there now.

416
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,470
Some tree, all right.

417
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:59,515
There's a trapper's cabin nearby. Maybe
we can get you a fresh change of clothes.

418
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,791
Swamp's no place to be at night.
Come on.

419
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,755
The last patrol is in. Whatever it is,
it disappeared for the night.

420
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,190
Some of the men say it's one of them
abdominal snowmen or something.

421
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,996
<i>(Ferret)</i> It was like hittin' a tree.
Bullets hurt it, but they don't stop it.

422
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,873
I say we forget this notebook.
It's not worth it.

423
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,355
What are we killin' ourselves for?

424
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,268
Just to find a formula
to some ordinary plant fertiliser?

425
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:44,635
"Ordinary"? Something extraordinary
came out of the experiments already.

426
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,788
Something that Holland or myself
had absolutely no notion of. None.

427
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:04,760
Would you recognise immortality
if it knocked on your door, gentlemen?

428
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,079
Obviously you wouldn't,
but that's beside the point.

429
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,237
I want this swamp thing,

430
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,032
and I want the notebook.

431
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,310
- Now.
- I'll get rid of him.

432
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,560
You will not get rid of him.
You will simply get him.

433
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:30,234
Pure elements of the formula
that determines him are there,

434
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,634
in his veins.

435
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,592
But... how can we find it?

436
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,108
It's gone into the swamps.

437
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,915
Every time you've seen the girl,
you've seen the beast, right?

438
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,155
That's right.

439
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,989
Then we'll find the girl,
the beast will follow.

440
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:52,557
It doesn't exactly maintain a <i>low</i> profile.

441
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,636
<i>(anguished roar)</i>

442
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,877
He was right. It is beautiful.

443
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,432
Who was right?

444
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,198
A guy I knew.

445
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,390
He loved these swamps.

446
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:36,115
Can't you call him?
Maybe he could come and get you.

447
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,870
Ain't got nobody you can call, huh?

448
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,516
Thought I had, but when I did
those goons showed up back there

449
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,394
and started making Swiss cheese
outta your gas station.

450
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,479
- Didn't pay your bookie or somethin'?
- Or somethin'.

451
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,750
Much farther?

452
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,275
A little ways.

453
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,552
- Stay here.
- Don't worry.

454
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,314
- If you hear anyone, you yell.
- Don't worry.

455
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,399
And if I don't come,
just go on and get yourself out.

456
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,556
I can handle myself. Don't worry.

457
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,790
I'm not worried.

458
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,350
Well, I am.

459
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,117
- What happened?
- Just go. Go!

460
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,951
We're just gonna do our job and get
this notebook back to Washington.

461
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,877
The rest isn't my business.

462
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,032
Local people
say this place is full of ghosts.

463
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:37,037
Well, there's gonna be one more
before this day is through. There she is.

464
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,079
Who's that?

465
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,879
<i>(roar)</i>

466
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,589
Who's <i>that?</i>

467
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,473
That was that thing. Let's go. Come on.

468
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,830
What the heck's goin' on here?

469
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,270
Cut the engine.

470
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,632
Units one and two. Sector four.
On the double. We got him cornered.

471
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,552
Where is he?

472
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,114
<i>What</i> is he?

473
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,109
Sh.

474
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,717
I think I see him.

475
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,072
Hit it!

476
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,836
Units one and two, where are you?
Get over here on the double.

477
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,270
<i>Split up. Go in the back way.</i>
<i>We'll come in straight.</i>

478
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,235
There he is. Over there.

479
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,232
Open up on him.

480
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,588
Hang on.
I'm gonna knock him outta there.

481
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,999
Jesus! Unit two.

482
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,590
<i>Use the grenades if you have to.</i>
<i>Maybe we can stun him.</i>

483
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,519
I think you got him.

484
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,753
He's still goin'.
Give him everything you got. Come on.

485
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,639
We've got him now.

486
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,232
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

487
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,799
- Do <i>you</i> see him?
- Yeah, I see him everywhere.

488
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,473
Any sign of him over there?

489
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,673
<i>Nothing. We think maybe he bought</i>
<i>the farm... or the vegetable patch.</i>

490
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,236
What the hell is that?

491
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,673
He's smart. That thing is smart.

492
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:36,557
Very smart, Bruno. Very smart.
This thing has considerable intelligence.

493
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,992
He's like a brilliant chess player.
He anticipates every move.

494
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,956
A strong adversary
is like a beautiful, dangerous woman.

495
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,231
I can't resist either.
Tell the captain to weigh anchor.

496
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,796
- We're going home.
- No, we are not.

497
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,195
Captured our knight.

498
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,595
Exposed his queen.

499
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,390
Our move.

500
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,148
Awfully quiet now.
We'd better get outta here.

501
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,430
I've gotta go back and help.

502
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:41,517
You just take the notebook and get
to safety. I'll come back for you later.

503
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,710
Go on, do as I say.

504
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,317
- Cable!
- Sh.

505
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:11,117
Jude, go and do what I told you.
It's not safe here any more. You hear?

506
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,275
Jude?

507
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,474
No!

508
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,951
Oh, shit!

509
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,992
There goes the neighbourhood.

510
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:32,319
Wait a minute. You're the dude
who saved us back there, right?

511
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,034
You a friend of Cable?

512
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,391
Then I got something for you.

513
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,034
She said I oughta put it someplace safe.

514
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,637
- Where's Arcane?
- Below.

515
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,558
Tell him we've captured his queen.

516
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,034
Walked right into our hands, didn't you?
Real smart.

517
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,470
Thanks. I knew we couldn't rely
on your intelligence.

518
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,276
What I couldn't do for you.

519
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,913
Tell you what,

520
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,555
tell me where the notebook is
and I'll get you outta the swamps.

521
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,195
- Deal?
- I don't mind the swamps.

522
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:28,835
It's the slime that crawls out from
under the rocks that turns my stomach.

523
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,439
Nasty mouth.

524
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,516
But a pretty one.

525
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,635
What do you say to <i>that?</i>

526
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,159
Not much.

527
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,394
Cable!

528
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,509
Cable...

529
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,398
Ferret!

530
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,071
Ferret!

531
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,876
Ferret!

532
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,874
- Maybe we should go and check.
- No, we go home now.

533
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,468
- Sir, but...
- Home!

534
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,556
That's very kind.

535
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,156
Nice orchid.

536
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,836
Family... <i>Orchidaceae.</i>

537
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,791
Genus <i>orchis.</i>

538
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,515
Over 100 species here.

539
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,119
Much beauty in the swamp,

540
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,634
if you only look.

541
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,078
Alec?

542
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,636
Oh, I'm sorry.

543
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,158
- It must...
- Hurt?

544
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,030
Does it?

545
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,073
Only when I laugh.

546
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,115
Have I gone crazy?

547
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,357
Isn't this a dream?

548
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,189
That's what I keep asking myself.

549
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,988
Everything's a dream

550
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,800
when you're alone.

551
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,033
Oh, Alec...

552
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:43,874
<i>(screams)</i>

553
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,713
Now.

554
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,109
Get the hand down!

555
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:20,355
A man who loves
gives hostages to fortune.

556
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,433
Alec.

557
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,915
Alec... Holland.

558
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,988
You knew, didn't you?

559
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,111
You knew we'd be caught.

560
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,953
The only way out is through.

561
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,718
<i>(upbeat sitar music)</i>

562
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:35,672
<i>(Arcane taps glass)</i>

563
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:41,438
The occasion for this celebration is,
of course, known to you all.

564
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:47,556
We have captured the dragon,
and rescued the damsel in distress.

565
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,955
We regret the loss of our friend Ferret.

566
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:53,516
His frayed and volatile temper
has destroyed him.

567
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,552
Nonetheless we regret his loss,
regret it deeply.

568
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,990
But to speak the truth, which is essential,

569
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:05,513
regrets are trifles
when one considers the grand design.

570
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:10,760
And we are here tonight in celebration
of an event of profound significance.

571
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,519
The duplication of the Holland formula.

572
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:23,755
For this we must thank
the excellence of one man.

573
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,916
Dear, dear Bruno.

574
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:30,158
Who won the notebook
from which we extracted the final secret

575
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,192
and topped it by capturing the beast.

576
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:46,558
So I propose a toast
to the keystone of our success.

577
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:51,356
To our conquest of the world. To Bruno.

578
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,596
Bruno!

579
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,511
But, sir...

580
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:10,633
Have you tried it out on a plant? I mean,
when are we going to see the results?

581
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:12,273
Tonight.

582
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,439
Tonight, dear Bruno. Immediately.
But not on a plant.

583
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,077
Have <i>you</i> taken it?

584
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:25,150
No, I have given the privilege
of taking the first dose of our formula

585
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:27,396
to our guest of honour.

586
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,432
He deserves the privilege thoroughly.

587
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,199
It is you, dear Bruno,

588
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:37,074
who will tell us
whether or not the formula works.

589
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,719
<i>(whimpers)</i>

590
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,317
Bruno, what's the matter with you?

591
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,795
- Calm.
- Help me!

592
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,998
<i>(screeches)</i> Help me!

593
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,391
<i>(grunting)</i>

594
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,599
<i>(women scream)</i>

595
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,076
Calm.

596
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,349
<i>(moans)</i>

597
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,395
What have you done with Cable?

598
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,271
Holland...

599
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,392
Holland.

600
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,871
You're there.

601
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,798
Brain intact.

602
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,480
All your abilities, everything.

603
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,910
Plus the power, the physical strength.

604
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,596
Bring him in.

605
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,479
Some friend you are.

606
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:34,434
Sorry, Bruno. It's every man for himself,
and... God against all.

607
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,435
Why doesn't Bruno have your strength?

608
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:54,034
We followed the notebooks religiously.
There can be no margin for error.

609
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:57,994
Why doesn't Bruno there
have your strength?

610
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,918
Because he never had it.

611
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,031
No riddles, please.

612
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:07,029
You will tell me,

613
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,673
or you'll pay.

614
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,678
And through a very dear agent.

615
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,397
Bring her in.

616
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,829
The explanation, or her.

617
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,996
Alec, don't.

618
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,279
Which?

619
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,597
You don't understand.

620
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,517
There's nothing hidden.

621
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,551
No secrets.

622
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,877
The formula works in so simple a way.

623
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:46,078
What Bruno took was what changed <i>me.</i>

624
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,430
It only amplifies your essence.

625
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:57,397
It simply makes you more
of what you already are.

626
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:02,835
Bruno's essence
was stupidity and timidity.

627
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:12,071
The formula simply extended, amplified
this to ridiculous forms and proportions.

628
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,078
He shrank.
He shrank to what he actually was.

629
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:26,075
But if the essence is, let us say, genius,

630
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:31,672
then this genius shall be monumental
in body as well as in spirit.

631
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,756
Is that what you're saying?

632
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:07,309
Cable.

633
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:09,878
Alec.

634
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:57,112
Not to be the phenomenon,
but the thing in itself.

635
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:02,917
Eternal, absolute beauty,
absolute strength and power,

636
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:06,793
physical and spiritual.

637
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,153
To be the world,

638
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,918
and own it.

639
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,514
Yes, sir?

640
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:16,834
Darling,

641
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:21,429
tell Karen
to bring me a glass of brandy, hm?

642
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:52,476
Reach for it.

643
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,750
You thrive on the light. Reach for it.

644
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:05,833
Alec.

645
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,234
<i>(knocking)</i>

646
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,316
Come. Come.

647
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:32,395
<i>(drops tray)</i>

648
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:36,630
What's the matter with you?
Go. Go. Leave me.

649
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,436
<i>(screams)</i>

650
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,519
Your arm.

651
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,596
<i>(grunts)</i>

652
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,156
Listen.

653
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,359
He's taken the formula.

654
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,596
Please! There is a way.

655
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:32,153
I can't reach it, but you twist it
to the right and then to the left.

656
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,430
Put there in case a guard
ever got shut in by mistake.

657
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,235
Come on, follow me.
Come on, follow me.

658
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:46,837
<i>(snarls)</i>

659
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:04,039
You'll have to trust me here,
if you wanna survive.

660
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,752
If you don't...

661
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:06,835
Tell us.

662
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:11,078
This is the well of the estate, fed by
a spring from the bottom of the swamp.

663
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:14,397
If you follow it,
you'll come out in the swamp.

664
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,069
Go!

665
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,149
Watch your step.

666
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,756
Have a nice trip.

667
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,630
See you at the ball. <i>(laughs)</i>

668
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,195
Alec...

669
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:48,995
Alec!

670
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,998
Behind you.

671
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,600
I don't understand.

672
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,676
It's healed.

673
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,317
What is it?

674
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:15,435
It's over.

675
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,429
Alec, let me go with you.

676
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:24,120
You can start your work again.

677
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,509
With these?

678
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:36,233
I'll be your hands.

679
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,313
Please?

680
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:43,989
You need to heal.
You need to tell our story.

681
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,838
I'll see you soon.

682
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,793
Until then...

683
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,759
I'll always be with you.

684
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,389
Alec?

685
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,071
Cable!

686
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,679
Jude.

687
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,876
You OK?

688
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:28,359
Mm-hm.

689
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,036
He told me to come and get you.

690
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:38,153
He'll be back, though, right?
