00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:24,503
Hello.

3
00:02:24,576 --> 00:02:27,739
Mr. Brooks, there's a Margo Brofman
on the phone for you.

4
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:31,805
- Oh, yeah? Put her through.
- Okay.

5
00:02:31,883 --> 00:02:34,181
- Hello??
- Hey, Margo.

6
00:02:34,252 --> 00:02:37,710
I'm giving a surprise party
Sunday night. Can you come?

7
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:40,189
Who're you gonna surprise?

8
00:02:40,258 --> 00:02:41,190
You.

9
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,618
- Who else is coming?
- Just Felicia and Liz.

10
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:46,857
Oh, yeah?

11
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:53,030
- What's the occasion?
- That's the surprise.

12
00:02:57,409 --> 00:02:59,877
- Hey, Mac.
- Nice-looking threads.

13
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:06,609
- Can I take some roses?
- Help yourself.

14
00:03:06,685 --> 00:03:08,118
Thanks.

15
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:29,540
Here you go.

16
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:40,717
Come in, Steve.

17
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:51,795
Looking good, slick.

18
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:08,676
- Felicia.
- Hello, Steve.

19
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:11,181
Thank you.

20
00:04:13,985 --> 00:04:16,112
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

21
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:20,483
And Liz.

22
00:04:20,558 --> 00:04:22,822
- Hi, Steve.
- Hi.

23
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,059
Hey, Margo.
Come on in.

24
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:07,694
Unbelievable!

25
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:11,275
Looking good there.

26
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:15,741
Sexy!

27
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:17,338
Unbelievable!

28
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:21,317
Slick, you are something else!

29
00:05:25,323 --> 00:05:28,292
Come on, Margo.
It's my turn.

30
00:05:42,807 --> 00:05:44,240
Oh, yes.

31
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:49,571
I don't believe this.

32
00:05:49,647 --> 00:05:53,879
I'm sitting here with three
beautiful women who said they hated me.

33
00:05:53,952 --> 00:05:58,013
- I gotta be dreaming.
- We still hate you.

34
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:03,861
We decided you should be punished
for the way you treat women.

35
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:05,190
Oh, yeah.

36
00:06:05,263 --> 00:06:08,824
Men like you
just have to be stopped.

37
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,834
How're you gonna stop me?

38
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:13,132
We're going to kill you.

39
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:17,373
What a way to die.

40
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:56,008
Oh, God.

41
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,240
We did it.

42
00:06:57,315 --> 00:06:59,909
We still gotta get him out of
the hot tub and down to the river.

43
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:01,918
- I don't think I can.
- You have to!

44
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:03,920
We can't do it without you.

45
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,158
You bitches.

46
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:02,235
Where am I?

47
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:05,943
Purgatory.

48
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:09,111
- Where's that?
- Between heaven and hell.

49
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,447
What happens now?

50
00:08:12,523 --> 00:08:16,516
On one hand, you've earned enough
credits to get you into heaven.

51
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:19,392
- Thank God.
- You're welcome.

52
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:24,265
On the other hand, you've been
so consistently rotten to women...

53
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:26,599
you deserve to go
straight to hell.

54
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:31,165
- That's pretty rotten.
- Perfect record. They all hate you.

55
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:34,177
- All of them?
- As far as I know.

56
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:36,838
You should know, but...

57
00:08:36,915 --> 00:08:39,975
it's kinda hard for me to believe
there aren't a couple of women--

58
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:42,884
Right now I'll settle for one.

59
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:45,684
So I've decided
that you should go back...

60
00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:50,854
and find one female
who truly likes Steve Brooks.

61
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:53,124
If you find her,
you go to heaven.

62
00:08:53,197 --> 00:08:56,257
If you don 't,
you'll spend eternity in hell.

63
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:59,633
- Back?
- Unless you have a better suggestion.

64
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:04,741
Back's fine.
Back's terrific.

65
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,478
Good morning. This is Ross Britain.
It's 8: 00 in the Big Apple.

66
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:10,480
Here's Keith Slaughter
and the Butchers...

67
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:14,177
pla ying what Jerry Falwell describes
as the devil's music.

68
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:46,149
Excuse me.

69
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:50,984
- Yes?
- I wish to lod ge a complaint.

70
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:52,989
What is it this time?

71
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:56,356
I have as much ri ght
to Steve Brooks' soul as you do.

72
00:09:56,427 --> 00:09:58,361
That's why I sent him back.

73
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:02,695
Ifhe can't find one female who
likes him, then his soul is yours.

74
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:05,600
That's not a fair test.

75
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,537
He'll pick some helpless...

76
00:10:08,606 --> 00:10:11,006
unsuspecting female...

77
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:13,669
pretend to be everything he's not.

78
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:15,679
In the end she'll adore him.

79
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:19,308
And you'll be honor-bound
to admit...

80
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:22,615
an unregenerate debaucher
into heaven.

81
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:25,554
What do you suggest?

82
00:10:25,623 --> 00:10:28,353
Teach him a lesson,
and at the same time...

83
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:32,556
make it impossible for him
to work his macho machinations...

84
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,896
on any more unsuspecting females.

85
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:39,402
And how do I do that?

86
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:41,637
Easy.

87
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:47,166
Make him a woman.

88
00:11:02,325 --> 00:11:03,257
Security.

89
00:11:05,896 --> 00:11:08,160
Okay, Mrs. Wetherspoon.

90
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:10,461
I'll take care of it
right away.

91
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:14,060
Some woman's screaming her head off
in Brooks' apartment.

92
00:11:14,137 --> 00:11:15,126
Again?

93
00:11:21,344 --> 00:11:23,835
She didn't sound like the others.

94
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:25,438
It was bloodcurdling.

95
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,418
- You want I should call SWAT?
- No.

96
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,673
Anybody here?

97
00:11:55,912 --> 00:11:58,312
Are you sure
you don't need a backup?

98
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:02,943
It's Mac!

99
00:12:15,498 --> 00:12:17,864
Hey, lady. Miss?

100
00:12:17,934 --> 00:12:20,994
I'm up! I'm up!
What time is it?

101
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,340
You okay?

102
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:31,209
- What the hell happened?
- Easy.

103
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:33,875
Looks like you fainted
or something.

104
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,282
I guess I must have fainted
or something.

105
00:12:46,596 --> 00:12:48,530
Oh, yeah.

106
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:05,539
Holy shit!

107
00:13:36,446 --> 00:13:38,141
Where's Mr. Brooks?

108
00:13:38,214 --> 00:13:40,409
Where's Mr. Brooks?

109
00:13:40,483 --> 00:13:42,747
- Who are you?
- Where's Mr. Brooks?

110
00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:45,083
Who am I?

111
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:50,582
How'd you get in here?

112
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,356
How do you know my name?
I never passed you through.

113
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:58,563
- Al was on duty.
- He didn't tell me.

114
00:13:58,635 --> 00:14:00,569
You sign in?

115
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:04,303
I don't remember.

116
00:14:04,374 --> 00:14:06,308
All guest are required
to sign the register.

117
00:14:06,376 --> 00:14:08,776
You couldn't have gotten in unless
Mr. Brooks said it was okay...

118
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:10,779
and you signed that register.

119
00:14:14,284 --> 00:14:18,584
Mr. Brooks must have said it was okay
and I must have signed, right?

120
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:21,123
Because here I am!

121
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:24,126
Here I fucking am!

122
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:33,395
- I'm not feeling too well.
- Want me to call a doctor?

123
00:14:39,976 --> 00:14:41,773
It's okay.

124
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:47,175
You know, I just--
I kinda--

125
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,946
I keeled over there
'cause I got some bad news...

126
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:52,749
but I'm gonna shower, shave.

127
00:14:52,822 --> 00:14:55,313
I'm gonna
pull myself together here.

128
00:14:55,391 --> 00:14:59,122
You know how it is, Mac.
You get up on the wrong side of the bed.

129
00:14:59,195 --> 00:15:02,494
- You haven't brushed you teeth.
- When will Mr. Brooks come back?

130
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:04,328
Not for a very long time.

131
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,868
- Really?
- Yeah. He, uh--

132
00:15:06,936 --> 00:15:10,872
You see, he told me
that he was going away.

133
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,306
- He's gone away.
- Yeah.

134
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:17,039
And he asked me
to take care of his apartment.

135
00:15:17,113 --> 00:15:19,775
- You're taking care--
- Yeah. Because--

136
00:15:22,285 --> 00:15:24,412
- Because we're sisters.
- You're sisters?

137
00:15:24,487 --> 00:15:29,015
I'm the sister.
I mean, I'm his half sister.

138
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:32,391
We have different mothers,
but he gave me his key...

139
00:15:32,462 --> 00:15:34,987
showed me how everything works...

140
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:36,861
so I'm gonna be fine,
just fine.

141
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:39,868
- Thanks a lot.
- Sure.

142
00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:57,216
How you doing there,
Mrs. Wetherspoon?

143
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,139
Un-fucking-believable.

144
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,008
- Hello?
- Hello.

145
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,108
Hey, Walter.
How you doin', buddy?

146
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:04,051
Who's this?

147
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:06,588
Who is this?

148
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:12,357
Okay, look, Walter.
I'm gonna try something here.

149
00:17:14,063 --> 00:17:15,325
I'm a woman.

150
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:17,524
Yeah?

151
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,400
It's me, Walter.
I'm a woman.

152
00:17:22,572 --> 00:17:24,199
Is this Connie?

153
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:27,068
No, it isn't Connie.
It's me.

154
00:17:28,478 --> 00:17:30,810
Okay. Forget it.
I'm a man.

155
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,611
I'm Amanda. I'm Steve's sister.

156
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:36,982
Wait till you get a load of me.

157
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:40,250
Steve doesn't have a sister.
Can I talk to Steve, please?

158
00:17:42,158 --> 00:17:44,149
You are--
I mean, you can't.

159
00:17:44,227 --> 00:17:47,162
It's after 1 0:00.
Steve hasn't shown up for work.

160
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,721
Look, it's really complicated.

161
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,565
Why don't you meet me for lunch
and I'll explain it to you.

162
00:17:53,636 --> 00:17:55,797
Steve would have told me
if he had a sister.

163
00:17:55,872 --> 00:17:57,601
No, he wouldn't.

164
00:17:58,574 --> 00:18:00,872
I'll meet you
at the City Grille at 1 :00.

165
00:18:00,943 --> 00:18:03,343
Wait, wait!
How I'm gonna know it's you?

166
00:18:04,847 --> 00:18:06,781
You can't miss me, pal.

167
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:10,250
I'm blonde, about 5'7".

168
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,345
Built like a brick shithouse.

169
00:18:17,827 --> 00:18:18,759
Desk.

170
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,962
Yes, Mr. Reed.

171
00:18:23,032 --> 00:18:24,966
Hold on a second.

172
00:18:30,673 --> 00:18:34,439
- That's the broad.
- I never passed her by here.

173
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,848
- You let her in?
- No, I didn't. She told me you--

174
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:37,870
- You let her in?
- No, I didn't. She told me you--

175
00:18:40,183 --> 00:18:42,310
- Morning, May.
- Wait a minute.

176
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:45,582
- She still in the sack?
- Wait a minute. You can't go up there!

177
00:18:45,655 --> 00:18:48,522
- I'd love a cup of coffee.
- Mrs. Brofman!

178
00:19:01,204 --> 00:19:03,638
Mrs. Brofman, open the door!

179
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,342
What, May?

180
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:18,845
- Who are you? Get out!
- Are you all right?

181
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:20,184
Call the police!

182
00:19:20,257 --> 00:19:23,852
Then you could tell them all about
that little party you threw last night.

183
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:29,831
What?

184
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,664
Divers shouldn't have any trouble
finding the body.

185
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:38,964
I can just hear
Felicia and Liz now.

186
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:40,737
Oh, yeah.

187
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,836
"We tried to drown him
in the hot tub, but...

188
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:45,142
Margo shot him.

189
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,741
Three times in the chest."

190
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:53,783
Don't call the police.
Forget the police.

191
00:19:53,857 --> 00:19:55,586
- You sure?
- Yes.

192
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:57,092
All right.

193
00:20:06,303 --> 00:20:07,531
Who are you?

194
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:11,330
Where's the gun?

195
00:20:13,043 --> 00:20:15,011
Who the hell are you?

196
00:20:16,613 --> 00:20:18,979
Oh, take a good look, Margo.

197
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:22,780
They say the eyes
are the windows to the soul.

198
00:20:22,852 --> 00:20:26,049
Look into my eyes.
Whose soul do you see?

199
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:32,084
It's me, Margo-- Steve.

200
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:34,392
You're crazy!

201
00:20:34,464 --> 00:20:37,661
I picked you because you're a lot
smarter than those other two bimbos.

202
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:39,668
Also, you believe
that fag psychic of yours...

203
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:42,864
told you you were Helen ofTroy
in another incarnation.

204
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:46,033
Way I figure it,
you'd have no trouble believing...

205
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:50,239
that I am the late, great
Steven Brooks, your ex-lover...

206
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:53,714
reincarnated as a gorgeous female.

207
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:55,182
Look deep, Margo.

208
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:03,716
You better believe it, slick.

209
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:06,694
'Cause after I borrow a dress
and some lipstick...

210
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:10,460
I am gonna have lunch
with my buddy Walter...

211
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:12,467
and you are gonna teach me...

212
00:21:12,535 --> 00:21:16,528
everything I always wanted to know
about women but was afraid to ask.

213
00:22:45,895 --> 00:22:48,295
How ya doin', Walter?

214
00:22:48,364 --> 00:22:50,992
- Amanda?
- In the flesh.

215
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:53,797
And what about that flesh?

216
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,338
Jesus Christ.

217
00:22:56,406 --> 00:22:59,773
Susie, I'll have
a margarita, please.

218
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:02,539
So what do you think?
Did you get a good look at my legs?

219
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:09,609
- So, Steve never mentioned me?
- No.

220
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:11,881
Well, that's understandable.

221
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:15,220
We only just discovered each other
a few days ago.

222
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:18,556
I'm his half sister.
We have different mothers.

223
00:23:18,628 --> 00:23:23,895
He sure did talk about you
quite a bit.

224
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:24,899
Really?

225
00:23:26,102 --> 00:23:27,933
Check out that ass.

226
00:23:28,004 --> 00:23:30,939
How'd you like to give her
a punch in the pants?

227
00:23:31,007 --> 00:23:32,770
You're not gay, are you?

228
00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:38,440
If I'm gay, Clint Eastwood
is a transvestite. Excuse me.

229
00:23:47,824 --> 00:23:50,258
You don't look like Steve,
except something...

230
00:23:51,327 --> 00:23:53,295
about the eyes that--

231
00:23:53,363 --> 00:23:56,127
But you sure do act like him.
You always drink margaritas?

232
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:58,258
- Yeah.
- So does Steve.

233
00:23:58,334 --> 00:24:01,098
Well, here's to Steve,
wherever he may be.

234
00:24:01,171 --> 00:24:02,638
By the way, where is he?

235
00:24:03,506 --> 00:24:07,272
I don't know.
He just said that he was going away.

236
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:11,036
- And he'd be gone for a long time.
- You're kidding me.

237
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:15,809
- No. He kept talking about Gauguin.
- Who?

238
00:24:15,885 --> 00:24:18,251
Gauguin.
He was a French painter.

239
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:23,657
He decided to chuck it all
and move to Tahiti to paint.

240
00:24:23,726 --> 00:24:26,286
He said he was
fed up with everything.

241
00:24:26,362 --> 00:24:28,296
And between you and me...

242
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:31,796
he seemed very depressed.

243
00:24:31,868 --> 00:24:32,800
Depressed?

244
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,664
Last night, three of his ex-girlfriends
were throwing him a dinner party.

245
00:24:36,739 --> 00:24:39,333
When he left me,
he couldn't have been happier.

246
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:42,708
Maybe the party didn't turn out
exactly like he planned.

247
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:44,713
Steve is not the kind of man...

248
00:24:44,781 --> 00:24:47,944
who would suddenly decide
to chuck it all and not tell me.

249
00:24:49,085 --> 00:24:52,248
- Did you check his office?
- For what?

250
00:24:52,322 --> 00:24:54,858
I don't know.
Maybe he left you a note.

251
00:24:58,094 --> 00:25:01,552
- You heard anything?
- No. It's very strange.

252
00:25:01,631 --> 00:25:03,963
Beth, this is Amanda Brooks,
Steve's sister.

253
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:06,194
- How're you doing?
- Mind if I look in his office?

254
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:09,204
- Maybe he left a note.
- Go ahead.

255
00:25:09,272 --> 00:25:12,708
But when I cleaned up his desk,
I didn't find anything.

256
00:25:15,478 --> 00:25:18,106
- You're his sister, huh?
- Half sister.

257
00:25:18,181 --> 00:25:20,911
We only just discovered each other
a few days ago.

258
00:25:20,984 --> 00:25:24,442
Oh, 'cause I've been his secretary
for two years...

259
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,454
and he never said anything--

260
00:25:26,522 --> 00:25:29,491
- Nothing.
- Did you look in the drawer?

261
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:31,857
- Yeah.
- Let me have a look.

262
00:25:31,928 --> 00:25:34,863
He told Amanda he was gonna chuck it all
and be like Gauguin.

263
00:25:36,366 --> 00:25:38,027
The painter?

264
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:41,502
- I can't believe he wouldn't call me.
- What's this?

265
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:43,937
- What?
- It's a note. Says "To Walter."

266
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:46,498
- Where'd you find that?
- In the drawer.

267
00:25:46,576 --> 00:25:48,510
I looked--

268
00:25:48,578 --> 00:25:51,775
"Dear, Walter.
I'm fed up with my life.

269
00:25:51,848 --> 00:25:55,875
I've decided to chuck it all
and start again like Gauguin.

270
00:25:55,952 --> 00:25:58,921
I asked Amanda, my half sister,
to stay in my apartment while I'm gone.

271
00:25:58,988 --> 00:26:02,185
Take her to lunch. You'll like her.
She's got a great pair of--

272
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,594
So long. Steve."

273
00:26:07,163 --> 00:26:09,131
- Was that his handwriting?
- Yeah.

274
00:26:21,744 --> 00:26:24,338
What's the matter?

275
00:26:24,414 --> 00:26:26,439
He's really gone.

276
00:26:26,516 --> 00:26:28,450
Yeah, it looks that way, sugar.

277
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:34,123
He always called me that.

278
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:38,258
You must have been
really crazy about him.

279
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:45,966
I hated him. I just--

280
00:26:46,035 --> 00:26:50,233
I always cry when I'm
really, really happy.

281
00:26:50,306 --> 00:26:52,638
Sorry. Excuse me.

282
00:26:55,745 --> 00:26:57,975
I'm sorry, Mr. Freidkin.

283
00:27:04,287 --> 00:27:06,812
Mr. Freidkin,
we just found this.

284
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:12,719
- Steve's sister.
- Half sister.

285
00:27:14,864 --> 00:27:16,297
Our Steve?

286
00:27:17,633 --> 00:27:19,567
Why, that son of a gun.

287
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:22,263
He didn't know about her
until a couple of days ago.

288
00:27:23,873 --> 00:27:25,807
Talk about your family secrets.

289
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,510
You should read the note.

290
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:31,012
What note?

291
00:27:43,092 --> 00:27:45,959
- This is a joke, right?
- No, he's gone.

292
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,588
- I don't believe it.
- You must be Arnold, Steve's boss.

293
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:53,601
- How you doing, Arnold?
- Yes.

294
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:56,467
Steve told me a lot about you.

295
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:59,997
Well, not all bad, I hope.

296
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:02,306
No, not all of it.

297
00:28:02,378 --> 00:28:06,439
We're gonna miss him.
He was one hell of an advertising man.

298
00:28:06,516 --> 00:28:09,713
He was that, yeah, but...

299
00:28:09,786 --> 00:28:11,720
I think he can be improved on.

300
00:28:12,822 --> 00:28:15,222
Oh, really? How's that?

301
00:28:17,126 --> 00:28:19,788
Why don't you take me to your office.
I'll tell you. How's that?

302
00:28:25,034 --> 00:28:27,366
You're sure I can't
get you something stronger?

303
00:28:27,437 --> 00:28:30,770
No, thanks. Except for
the occasional margarita at lunch...

304
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,967
I make it a habit
not to drink on the job.

305
00:28:35,678 --> 00:28:37,612
You sound like your brother.

306
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,947
- Who do you work for?
- You, I hope.

307
00:28:45,788 --> 00:28:48,222
I'm flattered.

308
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,555
Have you had experience
in advertising?

309
00:28:50,626 --> 00:28:53,390
Hire me and I'll get you
the Faxton account.

310
00:28:58,234 --> 00:29:00,429
Get me the Faxton account
and you're hired.

311
00:29:01,671 --> 00:29:06,734
Hire me, I won't tell you wife
about apartment "J" on West 57th Street.

312
00:29:08,611 --> 00:29:10,442
My God.

313
00:29:10,513 --> 00:29:13,038
What else did Steve tell you?

314
00:29:14,951 --> 00:29:18,717
He told me you pay him 200 a year,
plus fringes. I'll take 250.

315
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:22,253
Why should I pay you more
than Steve's getting?

316
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:24,893
Steve didn't give you a hard-on.

317
00:29:34,537 --> 00:29:35,868
Denise.

318
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,603
You knew Steve Brooks
pretty well, didn't ya?

319
00:29:40,676 --> 00:29:43,076
- "Knew"?
- Well, know.

320
00:29:43,146 --> 00:29:45,080
- Pretty well.
- So tell me.

321
00:29:45,148 --> 00:29:49,983
What adjective would you say
best describes him?

322
00:29:50,052 --> 00:29:51,485
Asshole.

323
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:56,024
That could also be a noun.

324
00:29:56,092 --> 00:29:58,083
Major asshole.

325
00:29:59,428 --> 00:30:00,759
Sounds great.
When do you start?

326
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,458
Tomorrow morning.
What can I say?

327
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:05,933
- How about you show me the ropes?
- Sure.

328
00:30:07,537 --> 00:30:09,402
Goddamn Italian shoes.

329
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:15,201
Yeah, well. It's gonna really be
great working with you. Steve and all.

330
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:18,543
- Why don't we have dinner tonight?
- Yeah.

331
00:30:18,614 --> 00:30:21,811
How about a little sushi
at Aiko's.

332
00:30:21,884 --> 00:30:24,648
8:00. Couple ofbeers at Duke's.

333
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,779
- Okay.
- Great.

334
00:30:26,856 --> 00:30:29,693
See you later, bud.

335
00:30:29,826 --> 00:30:30,952
Well--

336
00:30:32,128 --> 00:30:34,062
Let's see which one
of your guides...

337
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,361
is available
to give us some answers.

338
00:30:54,384 --> 00:30:55,316
Jesus.

339
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:11,391
Greetings, sahib.

340
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:14,801
Multiple blessings
from the eternal spirit.

341
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:16,798
It's Pasha.

342
00:31:19,776 --> 00:31:22,836
Pasha, is it appropriate
that we speak?

343
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:28,517
Exceedingly so, sahib.

344
00:31:30,253 --> 00:31:32,483
The answer to your question is...

345
00:31:32,555 --> 00:31:35,854
in order for Sahib Brooks
to be...

346
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:39,486
reincarnated, he must
first be dead.

347
00:31:39,562 --> 00:31:40,494
He's dead.

348
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:43,393
He is?

349
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:48,665
Well, isn't he? I mean, you're
supposed to know about those things.

350
00:31:51,007 --> 00:31:55,068
If, indeed, Sahib Brooks'...

351
00:31:55,145 --> 00:31:58,171
immortal soul has left
the bondage of this earth...

352
00:31:58,248 --> 00:32:01,012
it is reasonable to assume...

353
00:32:01,084 --> 00:32:05,020
it has not yet arrived
at its predestined spiritual abode...

354
00:32:05,088 --> 00:32:07,579
or of course I would know of it.

355
00:32:07,657 --> 00:32:09,887
Okay. Let's say that he is dead...

356
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:12,291
and he has been reincarnated
as a woman.

357
00:32:12,362 --> 00:32:15,160
- You see, the eternal soul--
- Let me finish!

358
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:18,890
Sorry, Pasha.

359
00:32:21,905 --> 00:32:24,931
Could it still be the same man
in a different body?

360
00:32:25,008 --> 00:32:28,375
Although the grand design
provides for...

361
00:32:28,444 --> 00:32:31,709
almost any possibility...

362
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:36,241
I have never heard of such a case
as you speak of.

363
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,983
But I will investigate and report
to you the next time we communicate.

364
00:32:41,057 --> 00:32:43,821
In the meantime,
peace be with you...

365
00:32:43,893 --> 00:32:46,555
and Brahma, the supreme soul...

366
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:49,723
the essence of the universe...

367
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:51,733
guide and protect you.

368
00:33:00,743 --> 00:33:03,075
That really takes it out of me.

369
00:33:04,747 --> 00:33:07,978
Pasha wasn't much fucking help.

370
00:33:10,253 --> 00:33:12,847
Aside from the fact that this....

371
00:33:12,922 --> 00:33:16,414
woman claims to be
the late Mr. Brooks...

372
00:33:16,492 --> 00:33:20,428
is there any other reason why you might
think that he would be dead?

373
00:33:20,496 --> 00:33:22,987
No, of course not!
What other reason could there be?

374
00:33:25,835 --> 00:33:28,167
You've reached 555-6731.

375
00:33:28,238 --> 00:33:30,399
Please leave a message
and I'll call you back.

376
00:33:31,674 --> 00:33:34,541
Hello, Kurt,
you ps ychic, ps ycho fag.

377
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:38,172
Margo, get your ass to Bloomingdale's.
I'll meet you in an hour.

378
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,123
Oh, yeah, that's pretty.

379
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:58,929
Where are you going?

380
00:33:59,002 --> 00:34:01,300
I'm going to Aiko's.

381
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:04,807
Don't you think something
a little less formal for sushi?

382
00:34:04,874 --> 00:34:08,105
Yeah, probably, but maybe
we should get it anyway.

383
00:34:08,177 --> 00:34:10,771
Bound to be other nights
when I can wear it.

384
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:12,781
Oh, bound to be.

385
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,914
You think I'd look good
in something like that?

386
00:34:19,188 --> 00:34:21,156
There's not much
you wouldn't look good in.

387
00:34:21,224 --> 00:34:24,751
I bet you say that to all the boys
who become girls.

388
00:34:26,496 --> 00:34:28,430
You need a bra.

389
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:31,433
We're about the same size?
34-C, right?

390
00:34:35,305 --> 00:34:37,500
Oh, yeah. I think we--

391
00:34:42,645 --> 00:34:45,239
- Cash or charge?
- What's the total?

392
00:34:46,816 --> 00:34:49,250
Including cosmetics,
perfume and jewelry...

393
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:53,119
it's $41,61 1.89.

394
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:56,950
How you wanna
pay for that, slick?

395
00:35:00,396 --> 00:35:02,261
She never lets me pay for a thing.

396
00:35:02,332 --> 00:35:05,130
If I tried, she'd probably shoot me,
dump me in the river.

397
00:35:15,445 --> 00:35:18,642
Do you know how many poor animals
they had to kill to make that coat?

398
00:35:18,715 --> 00:35:21,343
Do you know how many rich animals
I had to fuck to get this coat?

399
00:35:31,227 --> 00:35:33,161
Here she comes.

400
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,533
Excuse me.
Miss Brooks, is it?

401
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:43,265
I'm Stuart Higgins,
the apartment manager.

402
00:35:44,574 --> 00:35:46,599
Nice to meet you.
Do me a favor, Al.

403
00:35:46,676 --> 00:35:48,940
I'm expecting a big delivery
from Bloomingdale's.

404
00:35:49,012 --> 00:35:52,345
Would you send it up?
I got a hot date tonight.

405
00:35:52,415 --> 00:35:55,976
I'm sorry, but I can't allow you
to stay in Mr. Brooks' apartment...

406
00:35:56,052 --> 00:35:59,385
unless you can prove
you really are his sister.

407
00:35:59,455 --> 00:36:02,720
- Do you have some identification?
- Like what?

408
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:06,284
- A driver's license?
- I don't drive.

409
00:36:06,362 --> 00:36:09,456
- Credit cards?
- I don't charge.

410
00:36:09,532 --> 00:36:11,500
You told Mac the night guard...

411
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:13,865
that your brother
told Al the day guard...

412
00:36:13,936 --> 00:36:16,268
that you'd be staying
in your brother's apartment.

413
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:18,136
- Yeah.
- Well...

414
00:36:18,207 --> 00:36:22,166
this is Al, and he doesn't remember
your brother saying that.

415
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:25,214
- You don't remember that, Al?
- No, ma'am.

416
00:36:25,281 --> 00:36:27,215
- How old are you?
- Forty-nine.

417
00:36:27,283 --> 00:36:30,116
You told me you were 50.
Don't you remember?

418
00:36:30,186 --> 00:36:34,145
The day my brother introduced us,
you said you just had a birthday.

419
00:36:34,223 --> 00:36:37,351
- I met you?
- Yeah, I told you how young you looked.

420
00:36:38,828 --> 00:36:41,058
Could start that early.
It could.

421
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,121
It's probably nothing serious,
just short-term...

422
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:45,690
but if I were you,
I'd get it checked.

423
00:36:45,768 --> 00:36:50,330
You can call Arnold Freidkin.
He's my boss at F&B.

424
00:36:50,406 --> 00:36:53,705
If that doesn't satisfy you,
call Laura Patrick.

425
00:36:53,776 --> 00:36:55,505
- Who?
- Laura Patrick.

426
00:36:55,578 --> 00:36:59,981
Redhead my brother fixed you up with
when your wife was out of town.

427
00:37:01,217 --> 00:37:05,755
You should get checked too.
You're getting just as forgetful as Al.

428
00:37:07,323 --> 00:37:09,257
Check out the headlights
on the blonde.

429
00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:12,692
How'd you like to play "hide
the salami" with that for about a week?

430
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:15,921
Not me. You.

431
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:19,729
You don't think that's
a perfectly legitimate question?

432
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:21,394
Coming from a guy, maybe.

433
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:25,270
You don't think
women talk to women that way?

434
00:37:25,341 --> 00:37:28,572
Yeah, I guess so.
Sometimes. Some women.

435
00:37:28,644 --> 00:37:31,272
So what's wrong with a woman
talking to a man that way?

436
00:37:31,347 --> 00:37:34,874
I don't know. I just think that
when a man talks to a woman...

437
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,918
or a woman talks to a man...

438
00:37:36,986 --> 00:37:39,181
it should be more romantic.

439
00:37:39,255 --> 00:37:43,419
So women aren't supposed to feel or talk
about the same things a man feels?

440
00:37:43,492 --> 00:37:46,393
It's okay for a man to say
"I'm horny. I'd like to get laid."

441
00:37:46,462 --> 00:37:49,590
- This is not okay for a woman to say?
- You sound like Gloria Steinem.

442
00:37:53,102 --> 00:37:55,036
Let's go to Duke's.

443
00:37:57,706 --> 00:38:00,174
- Steve told you about Duke's?
- Yeah.

444
00:38:02,711 --> 00:38:05,009
I used to put your brother to bed
after six of these.

445
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,310
- Yeah? How many is this?
- Five.

446
00:38:07,383 --> 00:38:10,375
Good. I got one to go.

447
00:38:10,452 --> 00:38:12,386
Nope. That's a double.

448
00:38:13,455 --> 00:38:16,015
Then I'll just sip it.

449
00:38:16,091 --> 00:38:18,025
I was afraid of that.

450
00:38:21,497 --> 00:38:23,590
- I really miss him.
- Who? Duke?

451
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:25,600
No. Steve.

452
00:38:25,668 --> 00:38:28,466
Why? I mean, face it.

453
00:38:30,105 --> 00:38:33,268
He wasn't the nicest guy
in the world.

454
00:38:33,342 --> 00:38:35,970
Especially where women
are concerned.

455
00:38:36,979 --> 00:38:39,413
He loves kids, though.
And dogs.

456
00:38:43,018 --> 00:38:44,986
And he does things for people
nobody knows about...

457
00:38:45,054 --> 00:38:48,421
except for me and the shrink he was
seeing for about six months.

458
00:38:49,158 --> 00:38:50,090
And God.

459
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:53,862
- Yeah. He knows.
- She.

460
00:38:57,466 --> 00:38:58,933
He's like Popeye.

461
00:39:00,035 --> 00:39:02,162
- God?
- No. Steve. You know.

462
00:39:02,238 --> 00:39:05,469
"I am what I am."
He is what he is.

463
00:39:05,541 --> 00:39:07,634
He's a smart, funny, charming...

464
00:39:08,377 --> 00:39:11,642
dyed-in-the-wool
male chauvinist...

465
00:39:11,714 --> 00:39:16,048
who brags about most things other guys
are afraid to admit to themselves.

466
00:39:16,118 --> 00:39:19,679
And you know what?
He likes me.

467
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:22,019
He's very loyal.

468
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:24,025
You wanna know why, Walter?

469
00:39:25,861 --> 00:39:28,227
Why?

470
00:39:28,297 --> 00:39:30,231
Because he envies you.

471
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:33,791
See, you're a good guy.

472
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:36,099
How do you know that?

473
00:39:36,171 --> 00:39:38,799
- That you're a good guy?
- No, that he envies me.

474
00:39:38,874 --> 00:39:40,466
Oh. Well.

475
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:45,542
He told me.
He said, "Amanda...

476
00:39:45,614 --> 00:39:47,377
you stick with Walt.

477
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:50,077
He's a good guy."

478
00:39:50,152 --> 00:39:53,144
- Maybe I'm not so good.
- How come?

479
00:39:55,824 --> 00:39:57,314
To tell you the truth...

480
00:39:57,393 --> 00:40:00,157
I really, really
wanna go to bed with you.

481
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,221
Like that's a hot news flash.

482
00:40:03,299 --> 00:40:05,893
I can't because you're
my best friend's sister.

483
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:09,131
What do you mean? Steve wouldn't have
trouble going to bed with your sister.

484
00:40:09,204 --> 00:40:12,196
I don't have a sister.
Even if I did, I don't think he would.

485
00:40:12,274 --> 00:40:15,573
Oh, he would.
Take my word for it.

486
00:40:15,644 --> 00:40:18,306
So what are you saying?
That I should?

487
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,405
I mean, if I could--

488
00:40:20,482 --> 00:40:22,609
If you could, yeah, sure.

489
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,187
- But you can't.
- No?

490
00:40:26,255 --> 00:40:27,779
No. Sorry.

491
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:31,192
You mind telling me why?

492
00:40:36,598 --> 00:40:39,032
'Cause I'm not really
who you think I am.

493
00:40:42,137 --> 00:40:44,071
It's me, Walt--
Steve.

494
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:47,370
I died, and...

495
00:40:47,443 --> 00:40:50,173
God wouldn't
let me into heaven...

496
00:40:50,245 --> 00:40:54,477
'cause I been such a shit
to women.

497
00:40:55,985 --> 00:40:58,545
That's why? God.

498
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,554
If I want to go to heaven...

499
00:41:00,622 --> 00:41:02,647
I gotta find--

500
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,260
I gotta find one female
who likes me.

501
00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:09,559
That's not gonna be easy.

502
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:14,397
- Hey. You believe I'm Steve?
- Yeah. Sure.

503
00:41:15,704 --> 00:41:17,695
I knew you would.

504
00:41:17,773 --> 00:41:19,900
- Hey, Steve.
- What?

505
00:41:19,975 --> 00:41:22,068
I'd still like
to fuck your sister.

506
00:41:22,144 --> 00:41:25,807
- She is not Steve!
- You didn't look in her e yes.

507
00:41:25,881 --> 00:41:28,213
She didn't kiss you,
for Christ's sake.

508
00:41:29,418 --> 00:41:31,352
- Give me that.
- Spooky.

509
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,980
It's bullshit, darling.

510
00:41:34,056 --> 00:41:37,048
You're a sucker for that kind of thing.
That's why she chose you.

511
00:41:37,126 --> 00:41:39,060
How does she know about everything?

512
00:41:39,128 --> 00:41:42,291
You can laugh, but I get the feeling
she's watching us right now.

513
00:41:52,508 --> 00:41:53,634
Hello?

514
00:41:53,709 --> 00:41:57,543
You're a major stockholder
with Faxton Cosmetics.

515
00:41:57,613 --> 00:42:01,777
I want an appointment
with Sheila Faxton tomorrow afternoon.

516
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,715
You sound drunk.

517
00:42:04,453 --> 00:42:06,717
You sound stoned.

518
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:10,316
Three of you getting high, trying
to figure out what to do about me?

519
00:42:15,431 --> 00:42:17,729
- Was that--
- Steve.

520
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,961
- You mean Amanda.
- No, I mean Steve!

521
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:24,999
Coffee.

522
00:42:34,283 --> 00:42:36,808
Where is my address book?

523
00:42:36,885 --> 00:42:40,013
- Your address book?
- Steve's address book.

524
00:42:40,089 --> 00:42:42,819
- Oh. Bottom drawer.
- No, I looked there.

525
00:42:47,896 --> 00:42:50,091
Guess I can't think
with all this hair.

526
00:42:50,165 --> 00:42:52,099
You have beautiful hair.

527
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:55,136
You know how long it takes
to dry? Get me my barber.

528
00:42:55,204 --> 00:42:57,934
Your barber?

529
00:42:58,006 --> 00:42:59,940
I don't have a barber.
My hairdresser.

530
00:43:00,008 --> 00:43:03,341
In fact, who does your hair?
It's nice. It's all off your face.

531
00:43:03,412 --> 00:43:05,505
Sergei, actually.

532
00:43:05,581 --> 00:43:08,482
Sergei, good.
Get me an appointment with Sergei.

533
00:43:10,419 --> 00:43:12,614
Go, go, go!

534
00:43:12,688 --> 00:43:14,622
Media.
How may I direct your call?

535
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:18,023
Hello. A Miss Darlene Wooster,
please.

536
00:43:18,093 --> 00:43:19,720
One moment, please.

537
00:43:19,795 --> 00:43:22,025
- This is Darlene.
- Darlene.

538
00:43:22,097 --> 00:43:27,763
I'm writing a book called
Great Names In Advertising.

539
00:43:28,203 --> 00:43:30,763
Steven Brooks gave you
as a recommendation.

540
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:34,536
I was wondering if you could
tell me about him.

541
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:37,101
I don't believe that asshole
gave you my number!

542
00:43:40,249 --> 00:43:42,342
Didn't think
you were so hot, either.

543
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:03,770
Morning.

544
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:07,608
What's up?

545
00:44:07,676 --> 00:44:10,406
You said you wanted me
to show you the ropes, so--

546
00:44:10,479 --> 00:44:13,312
Oh, yeah. Right.

547
00:44:20,923 --> 00:44:23,721
- You look like shit, pal.
- You don't look too good yourself.

548
00:44:23,792 --> 00:44:25,851
You all right?
You're red.

549
00:44:25,928 --> 00:44:29,193
- Got a fever or somethin'?
- Probably too much rouge.

550
00:44:29,264 --> 00:44:31,198
Gotta be a fuckin' Rembrandt
to put on makeup.

551
00:44:34,603 --> 00:44:36,537
Put your chin up.
There you go. That's good.

552
00:44:42,511 --> 00:44:44,274
Remember when
I thought you were Connie?

553
00:44:47,049 --> 00:44:48,710
That's Connie.

554
00:44:48,784 --> 00:44:50,376
Good. All right.
Let's take a break.

555
00:44:53,222 --> 00:44:55,713
I think I need salt
'cause I keep crampin' up.

556
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:58,851
- Okay, turn the music down.
- Hi.

557
00:44:58,927 --> 00:45:02,454
Hi. I'm Amanda Brooks.
I'm Steve's sister.

558
00:45:02,531 --> 00:45:04,624
He never told me
he had a sister.

559
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,930
I'm his half sister.

560
00:45:07,002 --> 00:45:09,493
Hello, Walter. He never told me
he had a half a sister.

561
00:45:09,571 --> 00:45:12,870
- Have you seen him lately?
- Haven't heard from him in three days.

562
00:45:12,941 --> 00:45:15,637
I'm afraid he's disappeared.

563
00:45:15,711 --> 00:45:17,736
Where?

564
00:45:17,813 --> 00:45:20,748
We don't know.
He just...

565
00:45:20,816 --> 00:45:22,943
said he went someplace
to start again.

566
00:45:23,018 --> 00:45:25,179
- Start what?
- His life.

567
00:45:25,254 --> 00:45:27,313
- Like Gauguin.
- Who?

568
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:30,685
Gauguin, Connie, is a painter...

569
00:45:30,759 --> 00:45:33,785
who gave everything up
and moved to Tahiti.

570
00:45:33,862 --> 00:45:36,298
I thought you said
you didn't know where he went.

571
00:45:36,298 --> 00:45:36,320
I thought you said
you didn't know where he went.

572
00:45:37,198 --> 00:45:40,190
Right. So I guess you're
really gonna miss him.

573
00:45:40,268 --> 00:45:42,793
Yeah, I guess.

574
00:45:42,871 --> 00:45:45,863
- You liked him a lot, didn't you?
- Sure.

575
00:45:52,914 --> 00:45:55,940
- You're lying.
- No, I like him okay.

576
00:45:56,017 --> 00:45:59,180
You're just saying that because
I'm his sister. Tell me the truth.

577
00:45:59,254 --> 00:46:01,347
He's a putz. Sorry.

578
00:46:01,423 --> 00:46:02,549
You slept with him.

579
00:46:02,624 --> 00:46:05,286
Sure, and here I am
on the cover of Dream.

580
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,294
I'm the Dream girl
for November.

581
00:46:07,362 --> 00:46:09,956
- Connie, get changed.
- Yeah.

582
00:46:10,031 --> 00:46:11,965
Nice meeting ya.

583
00:46:12,033 --> 00:46:16,163
You know, you're gorgeous. You oughta
be a Dream girl for December.

584
00:46:16,237 --> 00:46:18,171
- See ya.
- Bye.

585
00:46:21,009 --> 00:46:24,069
If there are some of you who may not
have read my memo yesterday...

586
00:46:24,145 --> 00:46:26,807
F&B has added
two new additions...

587
00:46:26,881 --> 00:46:29,748
to its growing family.

588
00:46:29,818 --> 00:46:31,752
Miss Amanda Brooks...

589
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,913
whose pretty feet...

590
00:46:33,988 --> 00:46:38,357
will be filling her brother's
prematurely-departed shoes.

591
00:46:42,063 --> 00:46:45,430
And Mr. Dan Jones,
recruited from our West Coast office.

592
00:46:48,436 --> 00:46:50,404
All right.
Let's do some brainstorming.

593
00:46:50,472 --> 00:46:52,565
Who wants to get the ball rolling?

594
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,337
The Mama Weiss commercial
has been very successful.

595
00:46:56,411 --> 00:46:59,437
You know,
that was your brother's account.

596
00:47:00,949 --> 00:47:03,440
I have an idea that
might be just as good--

597
00:47:03,518 --> 00:47:05,452
maybe even better--
for Haycrest Foods.

598
00:47:06,955 --> 00:47:09,423
Home movies. Probably Dad...

599
00:47:09,491 --> 00:47:12,255
photographing the family
doing family things.

600
00:47:12,327 --> 00:47:14,727
Kids washing the car
on Sunday morning...

601
00:47:14,796 --> 00:47:16,957
squirting each other
with the hose.

602
00:47:17,031 --> 00:47:21,229
Mom caught in her curlers
picking up the morning papers.

603
00:47:21,302 --> 00:47:24,635
Family dog taking a little nap.

604
00:47:24,706 --> 00:47:28,267
Mom serving up some pancakes
to the kids for breakfast.

605
00:47:28,343 --> 00:47:32,473
Kids fighting over the bottle
of Haycrest maple syrup...

606
00:47:32,547 --> 00:47:35,812
which falls, bounces
but does not break.

607
00:47:35,884 --> 00:47:39,581
Amateur-style home movies,
professional message.

608
00:47:39,654 --> 00:47:43,181
Excuse me. I'm sorry
to interrupt...

609
00:47:43,258 --> 00:47:45,783
but did you discuss this idea
with Steve?

610
00:47:46,628 --> 00:47:47,617
No. Why?

611
00:47:47,695 --> 00:47:51,893
Well, I'm a little embarrassed
to bring this up...

612
00:47:51,966 --> 00:47:54,400
but I was taking some home movies
the other day...

613
00:47:54,469 --> 00:47:57,438
and I came up with almost exactly
the same concept.

614
00:47:57,505 --> 00:47:58,472
Really?

615
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,906
I called Steve immediately
and told him about it.

616
00:48:03,812 --> 00:48:07,976
I don't know what to say.
I feel very foolish.

617
00:48:08,049 --> 00:48:11,541
Oh, you shouldn't. Always remember
that in this company...

618
00:48:11,619 --> 00:48:15,385
it's not authorship that counts,
it's teamwork.

619
00:48:24,065 --> 00:48:26,295
Mr. Edmonds can see you now.
This way.

620
00:48:41,516 --> 00:48:44,542
I was just thinking.
Since we're both new here...

621
00:48:44,619 --> 00:48:46,985
how about joining forces?

622
00:48:47,055 --> 00:48:49,819
- Have dinner, talk it over.
- Great idea.

623
00:48:49,891 --> 00:48:51,825
- Get to know each other.
- Yeah.

624
00:48:51,893 --> 00:48:54,384
Let me save you
some time and trouble, Dan.

625
00:48:54,462 --> 00:48:57,989
I know all about you.
Your reputation has preceded you.

626
00:48:58,066 --> 00:49:01,866
Don't tell me you're one of those women
who believes everything she hears?

627
00:49:01,936 --> 00:49:04,427
Even if your reputation
hadn't preceded you...

628
00:49:04,506 --> 00:49:06,474
I'd still know all about you.

629
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:09,271
Is that suede?

630
00:49:09,344 --> 00:49:11,676
You're a pretty smart,
good-looking...

631
00:49:11,746 --> 00:49:13,680
sexual deviate...

632
00:49:13,748 --> 00:49:16,808
who has to score in order to prove
he's not inadequate.

633
00:49:16,885 --> 00:49:18,978
Sounds like you've
made this speech before.

634
00:49:19,053 --> 00:49:21,920
Don't get me wrong. Some of
my best friends are deviates.

635
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:25,482
But save yourself an expensive meal,
whatever's left of your ego...

636
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,085
because there is no way in hell...

637
00:49:28,162 --> 00:49:31,063
you are ever gonna
get me into the sack.

638
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:33,965
And switch aftershaves.
You smell like a salad.

639
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,065
I think I'll call you Amanda.

640
00:49:41,142 --> 00:49:43,474
Since you know
about the apartment...

641
00:49:43,545 --> 00:49:46,480
why don't you let me
give you a personal tour?

642
00:49:46,548 --> 00:49:50,177
It's stocked with champagne,
and it has a great view of the park.

643
00:49:50,251 --> 00:49:52,481
No, thanks.
I'm allergic to grapes...

644
00:49:52,554 --> 00:49:56,957
and corporate executives who take credit
for other people's ideas.

645
00:49:57,025 --> 00:50:00,085
- You're not suggesting--
- I'm not suggesting anything.

646
00:50:00,161 --> 00:50:02,755
You and I both know
you never called Steve.

647
00:50:03,998 --> 00:50:06,091
Even if you're right,
and you aren't...

648
00:50:06,167 --> 00:50:09,659
don't you think that's dangerous talk
for a corporate employee?

649
00:50:09,737 --> 00:50:14,572
- I think I can afford it.
- Really? What makes you think so?

650
00:50:14,642 --> 00:50:17,805
I have a 2:00 appointment
with Sheila Faxton.

651
00:50:17,879 --> 00:50:20,473
Still interested
in the Faxton account, Arnold?

652
00:50:21,783 --> 00:50:24,377
- Yes.
- I thought so.

653
00:50:52,447 --> 00:50:55,575
- You got a problem, pal?
- Yeah.

654
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:58,380
If you don't kiss me,
I'm gonna be sick.

655
00:50:58,453 --> 00:51:00,387
Then I think
we both got a problem...

656
00:51:00,455 --> 00:51:03,253
because if I do kiss you,
I'm gonna be sick.

657
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,794
Have a nice day.

658
00:51:09,497 --> 00:51:12,830
- Miss Brooks is here to see you.
- All right. Send her in.

659
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,561
Go on in.

660
00:51:51,205 --> 00:51:53,799
Thank you for taking the time
to see me, Miss Faxton.

661
00:51:53,875 --> 00:51:55,274
You're welcome.

662
00:51:55,343 --> 00:51:58,744
If Margo wasn't
a majority stockholder in Faxton...

663
00:51:58,813 --> 00:52:00,940
you wouldn't have made it
past the front door.

664
00:52:01,015 --> 00:52:03,643
Now that you're here,
what can I do foryou?

665
00:52:03,718 --> 00:52:05,549
You've got five minutes.

666
00:52:06,421 --> 00:52:08,514
Okay, I'll get
right to the point.

667
00:52:08,589 --> 00:52:11,956
I work for Freidkin & Booth,
and...

668
00:52:13,728 --> 00:52:16,094
we'd like to represent
Faxton Cosmetics.

669
00:52:17,532 --> 00:52:20,729
Horton & Benson represent Faxton.
Why should I change?

670
00:52:22,036 --> 00:52:26,063
Because we're new-fashioned.
Our people are younger and brighter.

671
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,506
And I go with the deal.

672
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:33,071
Exactly what does that mean,
Miss Brooks?

673
00:52:34,882 --> 00:52:38,784
If you wanna find out, it's gonna take
a lot longer than five minutes.

674
00:52:43,257 --> 00:52:44,349
Okay.

675
00:52:45,626 --> 00:52:49,289
I'm having a party this evening,
a few special friends.

676
00:52:50,698 --> 00:52:52,689
Kelly will give you the address.

677
00:52:53,835 --> 00:52:55,769
Good. Oh, what time?

678
00:52:56,771 --> 00:52:58,068
8:30.

679
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,039
Sharp.

680
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:06,081
Great.
Oh, what'll I wear?

681
00:53:06,081 --> 00:53:06,103
Great.
Oh, what'll I wear?

682
00:53:07,615 --> 00:53:09,048
Whateveryou like.

683
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:12,650
I'll be there.

684
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,984
With bells on.

685
00:53:17,225 --> 00:53:19,352
8:00 in New York City.
This is Kid Kelly.

686
00:53:19,427 --> 00:53:21,861
Here's "Are You Listening, Luck y"
by Joe Ely.

687
00:53:25,633 --> 00:53:28,693
Do you believe this body?
I'll never get used to this.

688
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:31,671
Be careful of Sheila.
She can be dangerous.

689
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:35,436
Do I detect a note of authentic concern
over my future welfare?

690
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:39,606
No, but these days my welfare
seems to depend on yours.

691
00:53:39,681 --> 00:53:42,241
Kathleen Seymour lived with Sheila
for ten years.

692
00:53:42,317 --> 00:53:46,310
She developed this fragrance for Faxton
and she always wore it.

693
00:53:46,387 --> 00:53:48,548
Yeah? What happened to her?

694
00:53:48,623 --> 00:53:52,024
She eloped with a French architect.
Sheila never got over it.

695
00:53:52,093 --> 00:53:54,027
You think it prudent
to remind her?

696
00:53:54,095 --> 00:53:56,893
Knowing Sheila, I think
it ought to just do the trick.

697
00:53:59,501 --> 00:54:01,435
Give it a whirl.

698
00:54:02,537 --> 00:54:04,402
- Nice touch.
- Thanks.

699
00:54:04,472 --> 00:54:08,135
- What the hell is this?
- It's a body suit.

700
00:54:08,209 --> 00:54:10,404
You've taken a million of them
off women.

701
00:54:10,478 --> 00:54:13,276
I used to hate these things.
Shit.

702
00:54:13,348 --> 00:54:15,680
Snap crotch.
Step into it.

703
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,844
- "Step into it."
- No, no. That's very fragile.

704
00:54:21,289 --> 00:54:24,281
- Snap--
- "Snap crotch. Step into it."

705
00:54:43,912 --> 00:54:46,972
- How're you doin'?
- Good, thanks. How are you?

706
00:55:08,503 --> 00:55:10,437
Oh, boy.

707
00:55:17,212 --> 00:55:20,477
- Hi. How you doing? Nice party.
- Wow.

708
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,686
- Hello.
- Hello, Sheila.

709
00:55:29,624 --> 00:55:32,650
- What's that you're wearing?
- I don't know.

710
00:55:32,727 --> 00:55:34,388
A little something I pulled
out of the closet.

711
00:55:34,462 --> 00:55:37,829
- Not really sure who designed it.
- I mean the perfume.

712
00:55:37,932 --> 00:55:40,730
Oh, well, that's yours.

713
00:55:40,802 --> 00:55:43,100
- You make it. It's called--
- Yeah.

714
00:55:43,171 --> 00:55:44,900
I know what it's called.

715
00:55:47,508 --> 00:55:50,500
Come on. I'll introduce you
to some friends.

716
00:55:50,578 --> 00:55:51,510
Great.

717
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:59,011
- So, you don't like the perfume?
- I love it.

718
00:55:59,087 --> 00:56:01,885
It just makes me
a little sad sometimes.

719
00:56:01,956 --> 00:56:04,288
And a little angry.

720
00:56:04,359 --> 00:56:07,920
When we get to know each other
a little better...

721
00:56:07,996 --> 00:56:10,328
I'll tell you all about it.

722
00:56:10,398 --> 00:56:11,330
Great.

723
00:56:15,303 --> 00:56:18,363
- Willy, Amanda.
- How're you doing, Will?

724
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,002
Oh, bo y, you were right, Margo.
That Sheila can be dangerous.

725
00:56:24,078 --> 00:56:26,569
Afterthe party, we went
up to her bedroom.

726
00:56:26,648 --> 00:56:29,378
We killed a magnum of champagne
in nothing flat.

727
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:33,511
We did about ten minutes on the merits
ofgood advertising and safe sex.

728
00:56:33,588 --> 00:56:36,386
Then we started
to undress each other.

729
00:56:36,457 --> 00:56:38,425
- I'll do it.
- Thanks.

730
00:56:47,602 --> 00:56:52,938
You know, I'll just put these
in my purse, okay? Excuse me.

731
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:58,177
You know, I was seriously looking
forward to what I fantasized...

732
00:56:58,246 --> 00:57:02,273
was gonna be a truly unique
sexual experience for me.

733
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:03,977
But it wasn 't
turning out that wa y.

734
00:57:04,052 --> 00:57:06,418
Something was definitely
out of sync.

735
00:57:06,487 --> 00:57:08,785
So I said to m yself,
"Steve, baby, come on.

736
00:57:08,856 --> 00:57:11,051
You may be a gorgeous female
on the outside...

737
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:13,992
but inside,
you're still 1 00% male.

738
00:57:14,062 --> 00:57:17,998
And Sheila isjust another
rich, horny broad looking to get laid.

739
00:57:18,066 --> 00:57:20,534
So go for it.
What's the big deal here?"

740
00:57:21,903 --> 00:57:25,168
- Zi pper.
- No, it's a bodysuit.

741
00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:27,799
It has one of those--
You know, those--

742
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:30,343
Those snappy crotches.

743
00:57:30,411 --> 00:57:32,606
Unsnap it.

744
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,614
Oh, yeah. Okay.

745
00:57:44,192 --> 00:57:47,423
It got very weird.
Suddenly, I felt--

746
00:57:47,495 --> 00:57:50,589
I felt like my panty hose
were strangling me.

747
00:57:50,665 --> 00:57:54,692
I got the shakes.
I couldn 't breathe.

748
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:58,068
And then she started kissing me.
And I fainted.

749
00:57:59,874 --> 00:58:02,365
I am so goddamn confused.

750
00:58:02,443 --> 00:58:05,003
I feel like my brains
are being ripped apart.

751
00:58:06,848 --> 00:58:10,147
- Did you do any drugs?
- You know I never take drugs.

752
00:58:10,218 --> 00:58:12,846
That's right.
You never do. Did.

753
00:58:18,259 --> 00:58:19,317
Jesus Christ.

754
00:58:20,395 --> 00:58:23,330
- It really is you, isn't it, Steve?
- Yes! Yes!

755
00:58:23,398 --> 00:58:24,490
Okay.

756
00:58:31,072 --> 00:58:34,166
All right. You want me to tell you
why you couldn't handle it?

757
00:58:34,242 --> 00:58:36,836
Unless you'd like me
to jump off the fucking roof.

758
00:58:36,911 --> 00:58:39,072
- She's gay.
- No kidding.

759
00:58:39,147 --> 00:58:41,980
- And you are a macho, homophobic--
- Homophobic?

760
00:58:42,049 --> 00:58:45,917
Yes, and gay-- male or female--
scares the living hell out of you.

761
00:58:51,325 --> 00:58:54,089
- Where are you going?
- To jump off the fucking roof.

762
00:58:55,196 --> 00:58:56,629
I should be so lucky.

763
00:59:00,067 --> 00:59:02,001
Son of a bitch!

764
00:59:10,378 --> 00:59:11,970
Morning.

765
00:59:14,549 --> 00:59:17,017
- Amanda, morning.
- Morning.

766
00:59:17,084 --> 00:59:19,882
I understand you saw the layouts
for the Brewster Mills jobs, right?

767
00:59:19,954 --> 00:59:22,650
- Yeah, it sucks.
- Hey, it's only a rough draft.

768
00:59:22,723 --> 00:59:25,749
- Women buy these products, Dan.
- I think I'm aware of that.

769
00:59:25,827 --> 00:59:29,126
No, that's a man's concept
of what appeals to a woman.

770
00:59:29,197 --> 00:59:31,688
Well, all the women I showed it to
thought it looked terrific.

771
00:59:31,766 --> 00:59:34,963
What women? Your secretary?
The ladies in accounting?

772
00:59:35,036 --> 00:59:38,631
What are they gonna say to
Mr. California-suntan-vice-president?

773
00:59:38,706 --> 00:59:41,004
- Arnold thought it looked great.
- Oh, Arnold would.

774
00:59:41,075 --> 00:59:44,533
He's about as sensitive
to a woman's needs as Jack the Ripper.

775
00:59:44,612 --> 00:59:47,945
Hey, maybe you're right,
but why are you so pissed off?

776
00:59:48,015 --> 00:59:50,643
I'll tell ya why
I'm so pissed off, buddy boy.

777
00:59:50,718 --> 00:59:53,983
I'm sick and tired of being treated
like a piece of meat.

778
01:00:03,231 --> 01:00:05,324
- Hello?
- Morning.

779
01:00:06,067 --> 01:00:07,762
I called you twice.

780
01:00:07,835 --> 01:00:11,066
Yeah, I just got in.
So, tell me...

781
01:00:11,138 --> 01:00:15,541
have you thought any more about giving
Freidkin & Booth the Faxton account?

782
01:00:16,711 --> 01:00:20,272
Well, you're all business
this morning, aren't you?

783
01:00:20,348 --> 01:00:22,543
Well, it's very important to me.

784
01:00:22,617 --> 01:00:27,645
I'll give it some more thought, and when
I decide, I'll give you a call, okay?

785
01:00:30,224 --> 01:00:32,715
- Okay.
- B ye.

786
01:00:32,793 --> 01:00:34,454
- Sheila?
- Yes?

787
01:00:34,529 --> 01:00:38,829
- In the meantime--
- Yeah? In the meantime?

788
01:00:40,501 --> 01:00:44,164
In the meantime,
could we have dinner?

789
01:00:44,906 --> 01:00:45,998
Sure.

790
01:00:46,073 --> 01:00:48,541
We can have dinner at Sardi's.

791
01:00:48,609 --> 01:00:51,476
Sardi's? Couldn't we go somewhere
a little less public?

792
01:00:51,546 --> 01:00:53,514
Well, that's no fun.

793
01:00:53,581 --> 01:00:55,640
I want to show you off.

794
01:00:55,716 --> 01:00:58,219
I'll pick you up at 7:30.

795
01:00:58,352 --> 01:00:59,376
B ye.

796
01:01:08,562 --> 01:01:11,190
- Come on.
- Where we going?

797
01:01:11,265 --> 01:01:12,926
- We're going to the gym.
- Why?

798
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,059
I'm gonna whip your ass.

799
01:01:28,349 --> 01:01:30,283
Okay. Game to 1 1?

800
01:01:32,953 --> 01:01:37,185
- I'll spot you two.
- Game to 1 1. You can shove your two.

801
01:01:47,801 --> 01:01:49,029
Ray.

802
01:01:50,304 --> 01:01:52,397
Don't get nervous.

803
01:02:00,114 --> 01:02:02,981
Come on, Walter. You're not gonna
let a girl beat you, are you?

804
01:02:22,236 --> 01:02:24,101
Shake hands with fate!

805
01:02:25,406 --> 01:02:27,636
Call the foul!
Call the stupid foul!

806
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:30,070
- Come on!
- Tie score.

807
01:02:31,512 --> 01:02:33,503
Next basket wins.

808
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,447
- Yes!
- Yeah!

809
01:02:41,522 --> 01:02:44,047
- Whoa! Bravo!
- Nice game.

810
01:02:44,124 --> 01:02:46,524
- Way to go.
- First time you beat me.

811
01:02:46,593 --> 01:02:48,720
What are you talking about?
I never played you before.

812
01:02:48,796 --> 01:02:51,196
Yeah, that's what I said.
First time you beat me.

813
01:02:51,265 --> 01:02:53,028
And the last time.

814
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:56,092
Well, you played
pretty damn good for a girl.

815
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:59,037
Don't be so fucking condescending,
Walter.

816
01:02:59,106 --> 01:03:01,506
I play pretty damn good for a man.

817
01:03:13,787 --> 01:03:15,379
Miss Faxton?

818
01:03:15,456 --> 01:03:17,822
- Bring me the wine list.
- Yes, of course.

819
01:03:17,891 --> 01:03:19,984
Unless you'd rather choose?

820
01:03:20,794 --> 01:03:22,785
Oh, no. It's your evening.

821
01:03:24,531 --> 01:03:26,999
You know,
I think we have a problem.

822
01:03:27,067 --> 01:03:29,194
What's that?

823
01:03:29,269 --> 01:03:31,999
No give-and-take.
We both want to be the aggressor.

824
01:03:33,107 --> 01:03:34,802
Somebody's gotta be the man, right?

825
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:36,900
What are we gonna do about it?

826
01:03:39,012 --> 01:03:42,812
- Flip a coin.
- Ha, ha. I'm serious.

827
01:03:44,218 --> 01:03:47,312
You know,
if you were really serious...

828
01:03:47,388 --> 01:03:49,822
you wouldn't have taken me
to this place.

829
01:03:51,725 --> 01:03:53,420
Where would you
like me to take you?

830
01:04:02,102 --> 01:04:04,161
You come here often?

831
01:04:04,238 --> 01:04:06,604
I used to when I was a man.

832
01:04:08,275 --> 01:04:10,800
When was that?

833
01:04:10,878 --> 01:04:13,142
Not so long ago in another life.

834
01:04:13,947 --> 01:04:15,778
Did you like being a man?

835
01:04:15,849 --> 01:04:17,840
Oh, yeah.

836
01:04:21,488 --> 01:04:23,422
What's it like?

837
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:25,883
Compared to what?

838
01:04:27,027 --> 01:04:28,858
Being a woman.

839
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:34,128
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not--

840
01:04:34,201 --> 01:04:37,534
You know, being a woman...

841
01:04:37,604 --> 01:04:39,538
it's not half bad.

842
01:04:41,141 --> 01:04:43,769
It's being both
that is the bitch.

843
01:04:44,845 --> 01:04:46,779
I'll drink to that.

844
01:04:49,016 --> 01:04:51,780
- How you doing, ladies?
- Aw, fuck off.

845
01:04:51,852 --> 01:04:54,821
What a shame. Didn't your mother tell
you nice girls don't talk like that?

846
01:04:54,888 --> 01:04:57,948
Bet you don't talk like that,
doll face, huh?

847
01:04:58,759 --> 01:05:02,320
Only to assholes who don't pay attention
when they're told to fuck off.

848
01:05:02,396 --> 01:05:05,297
Oh, I should have guessed.
Which one likes to be the man, huh?

849
01:05:05,365 --> 01:05:07,595
Tonight it's my turn.

850
01:05:13,574 --> 01:05:16,338
You talk like a man.
You fight like one.

851
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:19,208
Guess you really must have been one.

852
01:05:19,279 --> 01:05:20,769
Come on.

853
01:05:20,848 --> 01:05:24,841
Let me take you someplace
where you can be yourself.

854
01:05:24,918 --> 01:05:26,852
Wherever that is.

855
01:06:00,454 --> 01:06:02,388
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

856
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:06,550
Some place.

857
01:06:08,095 --> 01:06:10,029
Good evening, ladies.
May I take your order?

858
01:06:10,097 --> 01:06:12,292
- Two margaritas.
- Right away.

859
01:06:12,366 --> 01:06:15,460
- See? That wasn't so difficult?
- For who?

860
01:06:19,439 --> 01:06:22,602
You can tell Freidkin
he can have the Faxton account.

861
01:06:25,712 --> 01:06:27,646
Thanks, Sheila. Thanks.

862
01:06:28,982 --> 01:06:31,348
Wanna dance?

863
01:06:31,418 --> 01:06:33,283
Yeah. Sure.

864
01:06:34,354 --> 01:06:35,787
Sure.

865
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:46,224
- Who's gonna lead?
- You are.

866
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:48,791
Okay.

867
01:06:48,869 --> 01:06:50,928
Geez. I forgot how to do this.

868
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,401
This doesn't feel right.

869
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:59,474
- I can't.
- Then I will.

870
01:06:59,546 --> 01:07:01,571
I really wanna work this out.

871
01:07:01,648 --> 01:07:05,641
- Okay.
- I'm terribly attracted to you.

872
01:07:05,719 --> 01:07:07,152
Oh, God.

873
01:07:14,995 --> 01:07:17,486
Sheila, don't do this.

874
01:07:19,833 --> 01:07:23,496
It's not that easy. You'll have to
give me one good reason why I shouldn't.

875
01:07:29,276 --> 01:07:31,403
Listen to me.

876
01:07:36,316 --> 01:07:38,750
I only came on to you
to get the Faxton account.

877
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:41,754
That's the only reason?

878
01:07:43,156 --> 01:07:44,418
Yeah.

879
01:07:49,296 --> 01:07:50,923
You're cruel like a man.

880
01:07:56,903 --> 01:07:59,633
Sheila, listen to me.
Let me explain to you.

881
01:07:59,706 --> 01:08:01,674
- Listen, you don't understand.
- But I do.

882
01:08:03,076 --> 01:08:05,840
- You having a problem, Miss Faxton?
- Hey, fuck off, okay?

883
01:08:05,912 --> 01:08:08,608
- It's all right, Nancy.
- No, it's not all right, Nancy.

884
01:08:08,682 --> 01:08:10,616
I don't like being grabbed.

885
01:08:22,596 --> 01:08:24,029
Oh, geez!

886
01:08:49,456 --> 01:08:52,186
As you could see,
I'm not doing very good so far.

887
01:08:54,695 --> 01:08:57,664
Would it be kosher
if I prayed to You for a little help?

888
01:09:04,905 --> 01:09:07,430
Well, I'm not giving up yet.

889
01:09:12,312 --> 01:09:14,780
It's 3:00 a.m. in the BigApple,
and coming to you direct...

890
01:09:14,848 --> 01:09:17,908
from the Gahena Casino,
located on the Hades turnpike...

891
01:09:17,984 --> 01:09:20,919
a stone's throw from the center
ofthe Earth, the molten music...

892
01:09:20,987 --> 01:09:24,013
of Judas Iscariot
and his 30-piece orchestra.

893
01:09:25,726 --> 01:09:27,819
What is that smell?

894
01:09:27,894 --> 01:09:29,987
Brimstone.

895
01:09:30,063 --> 01:09:32,793
You'll get used to it
after a few hundred years.

896
01:09:32,866 --> 01:09:34,527
Who in hell are you?

897
01:09:36,603 --> 01:09:38,935
Who in hell do you think I am?

898
01:09:41,842 --> 01:09:43,776
You look like the devil.

899
01:09:43,844 --> 01:09:46,438
Well, you don't look
so good yourself.

900
01:09:47,414 --> 01:09:50,076
Just a little
netherworld humor there.

901
01:09:51,685 --> 01:09:55,177
Hilarious.
What do you want?

902
01:09:58,291 --> 01:09:59,553
You.

903
01:09:59,626 --> 01:10:02,094
- Your time's up.
- Says who?

904
01:10:02,162 --> 01:10:04,926
Have you found one female
who likes Steve Brooks?

905
01:10:04,998 --> 01:10:07,057
Well, I haven't
talked to them all yet.

906
01:10:07,134 --> 01:10:11,070
You'd just be wasting your time.
You see, I know who they are...

907
01:10:11,138 --> 01:10:16,440
and they all think that Steve Brooks
is a selfish, inconsiderate...

908
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:19,343
unredeemable male chauvinist pig.

909
01:10:19,412 --> 01:10:22,006
I don't believe you! You're
not to be trusted. You're the devil.

910
01:10:22,082 --> 01:10:25,813
Anyway, you know, He/She didn't give me
any timetable on this thing.

911
01:10:25,886 --> 01:10:28,047
- Look, you hate being a woman, right?
- Well--

912
01:10:28,121 --> 01:10:32,148
There's no fun in PMS
or shaving your legs.

913
01:10:32,225 --> 01:10:34,056
And what have you got
to look forward to?

914
01:10:34,127 --> 01:10:37,494
Guys like you used to be,
always trying to get into your pants?

915
01:10:37,564 --> 01:10:40,226
Cellulite, menopause.

916
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:42,860
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

917
01:10:44,104 --> 01:10:47,699
Right now there's a shortage
of good recruiters.

918
01:10:47,774 --> 01:10:50,436
I bet there's not a man alive
who wouldn't sell his soul...

919
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:53,707
for the chance
to jump in the sack with you.

920
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:55,372
Forget it!

921
01:10:56,283 --> 01:11:00,447
Sooner or later
I'm going to get you anyway.

922
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:04,889
Come along now, and I'll guarantee you
a hell of a time.

923
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:10,055
If you're gonna get me anyway, I'd just
as soon it was later and not sooner.

924
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:14,829
Terrible sight, to see a beautiful body
like yours go through a meltdown.

925
01:11:16,336 --> 01:11:19,271
- What?
- Tell you what.

926
01:11:19,339 --> 01:11:21,398
You want to hedge your bet with me?

927
01:11:21,474 --> 01:11:24,875
Make eternity a little less...

928
01:11:24,945 --> 01:11:26,242
hellish?

929
01:11:28,415 --> 01:11:30,542
What did you have in mind?

930
01:11:30,617 --> 01:11:33,017
Did you see Rosemary's Baby?

931
01:11:33,086 --> 01:11:36,146
Yeah. What? No! No!

932
01:11:36,223 --> 01:11:40,216
I can't, see?
I'm expecting my periods.

933
01:11:40,293 --> 01:11:42,352
I can't. I can't.

934
01:11:48,468 --> 01:11:50,129
- It's straight up 8:00...
- What?

935
01:11:50,203 --> 01:11:52,364
from the center ofthe known universe,
New York City.

936
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:55,340
This is Ross Brittain,
and we're locked into a pretty nice da y.

937
01:11:55,408 --> 01:11:59,712
Sunshine, blue skies, so check
your body parts and let's get bus y!

938
01:12:01,747 --> 01:12:03,681
Sorry I'm late.

939
01:12:13,726 --> 01:12:16,752
I've called this meeting
to congratulate Amanda...

940
01:12:16,829 --> 01:12:19,525
for convincing Miss Faxton...

941
01:12:19,598 --> 01:12:23,090
that F&B is the best agency
to handle Faxton Cosmetics...

942
01:12:23,168 --> 01:12:26,001
and to hear personally
from Miss Faxton...

943
01:12:26,071 --> 01:12:31,441
what ideas she might have
to put us on the right track.

944
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:33,444
Miss Faxton?

945
01:12:34,446 --> 01:12:37,904
Well, obviously, I have some ideas.

946
01:12:37,983 --> 01:12:41,441
Faxton Cosmetics is the keystone
to Faxton, Inc...

947
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:45,012
and I intend to work hands-on
with the account executive.

948
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:50,027
Therefore, I expect you to give me
your most qualified, most experienced...

949
01:12:50,095 --> 01:12:52,427
and most political executive.

950
01:12:52,498 --> 01:12:56,662
Naturally.
Do you have someone in mind?

951
01:12:56,735 --> 01:12:59,033
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

952
01:13:01,273 --> 01:13:02,797
What about Dan?

953
01:13:05,377 --> 01:13:07,811
- Oh, I'd be honored.
- Fine.

954
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,472
- Good.
- Then it's settled.

955
01:13:09,548 --> 01:13:11,812
Absolutely. I understand.

956
01:13:12,885 --> 01:13:15,353
Congratulations, Dan.

957
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:18,651
Thanks.
I want you on the team.

958
01:13:18,724 --> 01:13:22,125
Oh, good. Why don't we
discuss it over dinner...

959
01:13:22,194 --> 01:13:23,559
at Sardi's?

960
01:13:23,629 --> 01:13:27,326
Unless you prefer to go someplace
a little more private.

961
01:13:27,399 --> 01:13:30,596
No. Sardi's is great.

962
01:13:30,669 --> 01:13:32,694
Good.

963
01:13:32,771 --> 01:13:35,035
Then I can show you off.

964
01:13:37,643 --> 01:13:42,671
Amanda, I located Rebecca Heckencamp
who is now Mrs. Rebecca Sanderson...

965
01:13:42,748 --> 01:13:44,648
still living in Allentown.

966
01:13:44,716 --> 01:13:46,650
Good. Get her.

967
01:13:48,687 --> 01:13:52,714
Amanda, something's come up, and
I can't have dinner with you tonight.

968
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:55,954
Sheila Faxton wants to talk to you
about the account, huh?

969
01:13:56,028 --> 01:13:58,121
Yeah. I'm really disappointed.

970
01:13:58,197 --> 01:14:01,291
I was looking forward
to getting to know you better.

971
01:14:01,366 --> 01:14:03,926
Next week, maybe?
Monday? Tuesday?

972
01:14:04,002 --> 01:14:05,663
Look, don't push it Dan, okay?

973
01:14:11,443 --> 01:14:12,910
Schmuck.

974
01:14:12,978 --> 01:14:14,570
Rebecca Sanderson.

975
01:14:16,148 --> 01:14:17,479
- Rebecca.
- Yes?

976
01:14:17,549 --> 01:14:21,041
I'm doing a book
about the advertising business...

977
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:23,553
and the men who've been
successful in the field.

978
01:14:23,622 --> 01:14:26,648
I understand that you went
to high school with Mr. Steven Brooks.

979
01:14:26,725 --> 01:14:29,660
Steven Brooks? The prick
that knocked me up? I hate his guts!

980
01:14:29,728 --> 01:14:32,458
Really? I'm shocked because,
you know...

981
01:14:32,531 --> 01:14:34,556
that's not at all
the way he remembers it.

982
01:14:34,633 --> 01:14:38,535
Well, he has a lousy memory. Ifl ever
see him again I'll rip his balls off!

983
01:14:38,604 --> 01:14:41,038
And you still feel that way
after all these years?

984
01:14:41,106 --> 01:14:43,904
- You bet I do. That son ofa bitch--
- Oh, I understand. Yeah.

985
01:14:43,976 --> 01:14:45,910
I just can't print it.

986
01:14:49,982 --> 01:14:52,542
Getting down to the bottom
of the barrel, slick.

987
01:14:57,890 --> 01:15:00,552
So it looks like Danny boy's gonna be
tied up for the weekend, huh?

988
01:15:01,894 --> 01:15:04,089
Tied up is a definite possibility.

989
01:15:05,163 --> 01:15:08,997
- Wanna go to Duke's?
- Sure. We'll shoot some straight pool.

990
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:13,267
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

991
01:15:27,052 --> 01:15:29,179
- Hello?
- Hello, Brenda?

992
01:15:29,254 --> 01:15:31,848
- Who is this?
- I'm calling about Steven Brooks--

993
01:15:31,924 --> 01:15:34,222
- Go fuck yourself.
- Hello? Brenda?

994
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:44,095
Shit!

995
01:15:47,572 --> 01:15:50,268
Did you call your hairdresser?

996
01:15:50,342 --> 01:15:52,572
Yeah, but he can't take you
until next Wednesday.

997
01:15:52,644 --> 01:15:56,375
What did-- Fuck!
All's I want is a fucking haircut!

998
01:16:25,277 --> 01:16:28,906
- What can I do foryou?
- I'll take a ham on rye.

999
01:16:30,048 --> 01:16:32,107
This is a barber shop,
not a delicatessen.

1000
01:16:32,184 --> 01:16:34,812
Oh. Well, then, why don't you
give me a haircut?

1001
01:16:40,158 --> 01:16:42,649
Laura, Higgins.
Wife still out of town?

1002
01:16:46,431 --> 01:16:50,492
Hey, Walt. Sorry I'm so late.
Had one of those psycho cab drivers.

1003
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:53,895
What?

1004
01:16:53,972 --> 01:16:56,133
Oh, yeah. I had a haircut.

1005
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:58,438
- Like it?
- Yeah, it's--

1006
01:16:58,510 --> 01:17:00,444
It's just such a surprise.
You don't have any--

1007
01:17:00,512 --> 01:17:02,241
What happened?
You looked so beautiful.

1008
01:17:02,314 --> 01:17:05,010
It took me an hour
to blow it dry every morning.

1009
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:07,278
- Hi, Amanda.
- Yo, Casanova.

1010
01:17:07,352 --> 01:17:09,479
- What are you drinking?
- Bud.

1011
01:17:09,554 --> 01:17:11,146
Two Buds.

1012
01:17:14,459 --> 01:17:16,859
- Where'd you learn to shoot?
- Misspent youth.

1013
01:17:17,929 --> 01:17:19,863
I bet you could beat Steve.

1014
01:17:21,533 --> 01:17:23,398
I doubt it.

1015
01:17:24,469 --> 01:17:27,199
Hey, that's her. She's the one
I was telling you about last night.

1016
01:17:27,272 --> 01:17:29,103
- Her?
- Yeah.

1017
01:17:29,174 --> 01:17:31,142
Cut her hair.
That's more like it.

1018
01:17:31,209 --> 01:17:33,700
- Last night I though she was a girl.
- Hey, guys.

1019
01:17:34,813 --> 01:17:37,646
- Let it go, Walter.
- She hit you when you wasn't looking?

1020
01:17:37,716 --> 01:17:40,480
- You gotta be kidding me. Her?
- We're in the middle of a game here.

1021
01:17:40,552 --> 01:17:42,179
Forget about it, Walter.

1022
01:17:42,254 --> 01:17:45,223
Hey, Walter, you with her--
him-- whatever she is?

1023
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:48,316
- Yeah. You got a problem with that?
- Looks like you got the problem.

1024
01:17:49,427 --> 01:17:51,725
- We should take the problem outside.
- Let's go do it.

1025
01:18:34,572 --> 01:18:36,597
Hey, doll face,
did somebody hurt you?

1026
01:18:44,382 --> 01:18:44,749
Okay. Come on, bud.

1027
01:18:44,749 --> 01:18:46,740
Okay. Come on, bud.

1028
01:18:46,818 --> 01:18:50,345
Oh, for Christ's fucking sake,
Walter, you're really gaining weight.

1029
01:18:51,423 --> 01:18:53,618
How you doing there,
Mrs. Wetherspoon?

1030
01:18:53,692 --> 01:18:56,593
Oh,Jesus Christ.
Okay, you.

1031
01:18:57,696 --> 01:18:58,958
Oh, yeah.

1032
01:19:03,368 --> 01:19:04,926
- Okay.
- Amanda?

1033
01:19:05,003 --> 01:19:06,766
Yeah, Walter. It's me.

1034
01:19:14,846 --> 01:19:17,440
Oh, God.
Hey, cut it out, Walter.

1035
01:19:17,515 --> 01:19:19,142
Jesus!

1036
01:19:19,217 --> 01:19:20,980
Okay. Come on, bud.

1037
01:19:21,052 --> 01:19:23,384
I got you. I got you.

1038
01:19:23,455 --> 01:19:25,719
I got you now.
Okay.

1039
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:27,553
Here you go.

1040
01:19:43,575 --> 01:19:45,475
Okay, come on, Walter.
Take off your pants.

1041
01:19:45,543 --> 01:19:48,842
Why, Miss Brooks,
what would your brother say?

1042
01:19:48,913 --> 01:19:51,438
You know you're too drunk
to get home.

1043
01:19:51,516 --> 01:19:53,416
- You'll have to sleep here.
- Okay.

1044
01:19:53,485 --> 01:19:57,080
So we'll take off your pants
and then--

1045
01:19:57,155 --> 01:19:59,623
Come on, Walter.
Quit fooling around now.

1046
01:19:59,691 --> 01:20:02,717
- Okay. I'll help.
- Get into bed.

1047
01:20:02,794 --> 01:20:05,763
Give me a hand here, Walter.
Come on, pretty boy. That's it.

1048
01:20:11,903 --> 01:20:13,837
Okay. Quit fucking around.

1049
01:20:23,048 --> 01:20:25,710
- Okay, come on. Get in the bed, Walter.
- Yes, dear.

1050
01:20:29,988 --> 01:20:31,250
Oh, God.

1051
01:20:38,229 --> 01:20:41,596
- The lights are on.
- Yeah, I know the light's on.

1052
01:20:42,934 --> 01:20:46,199
What do you think I am? You think
I don't know when the light is on?

1053
01:20:49,174 --> 01:20:50,436
Schmuck.

1054
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,508
Get your hand off my ass.

1055
01:21:00,018 --> 01:21:02,350
You sure?

1056
01:21:10,562 --> 01:21:13,395
No more hanky-panky, Walter.

1057
01:21:13,465 --> 01:21:15,262
No more hanky-panky.

1058
01:21:28,279 --> 01:21:30,179
I'm up! I'm up.

1059
01:21:36,788 --> 01:21:38,050
Oh, yeah.

1060
01:21:42,293 --> 01:21:44,761
- Hello.
- Mrs. Brofman here to see you.

1061
01:21:44,829 --> 01:21:47,559
What?
What the hell time is it?

1062
01:21:47,632 --> 01:21:49,566
It's a quarterto 10:00.

1063
01:21:51,703 --> 01:21:53,637
Okay. Send her up.

1064
01:21:54,372 --> 01:21:56,840
- Go on up.
- Thanks, Mac.

1065
01:21:59,244 --> 01:22:00,836
Ridiculous.

1066
01:22:02,413 --> 01:22:04,074
Oh, my God Alm--

1067
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:13,824
Walter, where are your shorts?

1068
01:22:20,098 --> 01:22:23,226
When you went to bed last night
you were wearing your shorts.

1069
01:22:23,301 --> 01:22:27,135
- Now, when did you take them off?
- I don't recall the exact moment.

1070
01:22:27,205 --> 01:22:29,400
And wipe that stupid smile
off your face.

1071
01:22:29,474 --> 01:22:32,034
Walter, how come
you took your shorts off?

1072
01:22:33,077 --> 01:22:35,602
- Amanda, don't you remember?
- Remember what, Walter?

1073
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:38,478
- Remember what?
- Well, we made love.

1074
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:47,252
Son of a bitch.

1075
01:22:49,661 --> 01:22:52,255
- Good morning.
- What's so fucking good about it?

1076
01:22:53,364 --> 01:22:56,822
You're in a great mood.
What's the matter? Got your period?

1077
01:22:56,901 --> 01:22:59,165
I should be so fucking lucky.

1078
01:22:59,237 --> 01:23:01,171
Yeah? What happened?

1079
01:23:03,441 --> 01:23:04,965
It's a long story.

1080
01:23:06,377 --> 01:23:08,311
Just give me the punch line.

1081
01:23:11,216 --> 01:23:12,843
I lost my virginity.

1082
01:23:15,553 --> 01:23:17,487
Obviously without your consent.

1083
01:23:17,555 --> 01:23:19,352
I passed out.
I don't remember anything.

1084
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:22,086
- Who's the unlucky man?
- Hi, Margo.

1085
01:23:24,963 --> 01:23:28,763
Well, it's not exactly Romeo and Juliet,
but, then, I always say to each his own.

1086
01:23:28,833 --> 01:23:30,994
- Amanda, we gotta talk.
- I don't talk to rapists.

1087
01:23:31,069 --> 01:23:33,833
- Rapists?
- I was drunk, passed out.

1088
01:23:33,905 --> 01:23:36,237
- She loved it!
- Bullshit, Walt!

1089
01:23:36,307 --> 01:23:38,639
Don't you give me
that macho, self-serving crap.

1090
01:23:38,710 --> 01:23:41,440
I was unconscious, buddy boy.
I didn't love anything.

1091
01:23:41,512 --> 01:23:43,241
I was helpless.
You took advantage of me.

1092
01:23:43,314 --> 01:23:45,441
I have never taken advantage
of anybody in my life.

1093
01:23:45,516 --> 01:23:48,610
That's what all you guys say. You take
a girl out for dinner, get her drunk.

1094
01:23:48,686 --> 01:23:52,349
It's date rape, Walt. Read the paper.
It happens all the time.

1095
01:23:52,423 --> 01:23:54,584
- Well, not here last night.
- I don't believe it.

1096
01:23:54,659 --> 01:23:57,856
I mean, after all the years
we've been buddies, it's like--

1097
01:23:57,929 --> 01:24:00,898
You know, guys like you are
what's wrong with society.

1098
01:24:00,965 --> 01:24:03,729
- All the years we've been buddies?
- What the fuck are you talking about?

1099
01:24:03,801 --> 01:24:05,564
Don't try to change the subject here.

1100
01:24:05,637 --> 01:24:08,868
Do you realize every six minutes
a woman is raped in this country?

1101
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:11,636
- I didn't realize. I'm sorry.
- You didn't realize. Why should you?

1102
01:24:11,709 --> 01:24:15,941
Why should you care? You're one of the
assholes responsible for the statistic!

1103
01:24:16,014 --> 01:24:17,914
- Now, wait a goddamn minute--
- For what, Walt?

1104
01:24:17,982 --> 01:24:21,179
Foryou to rape some other poor,
innocent, unsuspecting female?

1105
01:24:21,252 --> 01:24:23,243
I was a virgin, goddamn you!

1106
01:24:27,725 --> 01:24:31,752
This morning, the body of Steven Brooks,
New York advertising executive...

1107
01:24:31,829 --> 01:24:34,195
was discovered floating
in the East River.

1108
01:24:34,265 --> 01:24:38,065
According to the police, Brooks
had been shot three times in the chest.

1109
01:24:38,136 --> 01:24:41,799
We'll continue to report on the facts
ofthis case as they unfold.

1110
01:24:41,873 --> 01:24:46,173
And, when we return, Ken L omax will
bring you the entertainment report.

1111
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:57,482
Hello?

1112
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:06,830
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sure.

1113
01:25:22,647 --> 01:25:24,581
Well, who was that?

1114
01:25:29,454 --> 01:25:31,388
It was the police.

1115
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,228
I gotta identify my body.

1116
01:25:42,166 --> 01:25:45,727
Sorry to do this to you, but apparently
you're his only living relative.

1117
01:25:50,808 --> 01:25:54,300
This isn't going to be very pleasant.
The body's been in the water for days.

1118
01:25:58,649 --> 01:26:01,720
God, I look awful.

1119
01:26:08,226 --> 01:26:10,251
Holy shit.

1120
01:26:13,631 --> 01:26:15,963
Jesus H. Christ.

1121
01:26:16,034 --> 01:26:18,559
- Miss Brooks--
- Oh, Higgins.

1122
01:26:18,636 --> 01:26:22,402
- The police came with a search warrant.
- What?

1123
01:26:22,474 --> 01:26:26,205
If they arrest you, please don't say
anything about the little redhead.

1124
01:26:26,277 --> 01:26:28,837
What makes you think
they're gonna arrest me?

1125
01:26:28,913 --> 01:26:30,904
They found your gun.

1126
01:26:36,121 --> 01:26:39,887
This whole thing feels
like a bad dream.

1127
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:49,193
Are you really sure
that they can't trace that gun?

1128
01:26:50,602 --> 01:26:52,797
Not a chance.

1129
01:26:54,506 --> 01:26:55,973
You bitch!

1130
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:58,565
You planted that gun
in my apartment.

1131
01:26:59,911 --> 01:27:02,607
The gun's not registered!
They'll never trace it!

1132
01:27:03,448 --> 01:27:06,144
You killed me, Margo.
I'm not taking the rap for it.

1133
01:27:06,217 --> 01:27:09,243
What are you gonna tell them?
"You're not really a woman"?

1134
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:12,585
-You're Steve Brooks back from the dead?
-I got you to believe me, didn't I?

1135
01:27:16,594 --> 01:27:20,621
They'll lock you away in a padded cell
and throw away the key!

1136
01:27:20,698 --> 01:27:23,963
You'll never find that one female
who's gonna get you into heaven.

1137
01:27:26,704 --> 01:27:28,296
How much money you got?

1138
01:27:29,374 --> 01:27:32,275
Three thousand.
It's in my purse on the bed.

1139
01:27:35,013 --> 01:27:39,507
Direct from New York to LosAngeles,
here at gate number one.

1140
01:27:49,494 --> 01:27:52,691
Miss Brooks.
Going someplace?

1141
01:27:53,765 --> 01:27:56,256
No, I just like
to hang around airports.

1142
01:27:56,334 --> 01:27:59,269
You're under arrest for the murder
of Steven Brooks.

1143
01:27:59,337 --> 01:28:01,362
You invited Mr. Brooks to the party.

1144
01:28:01,439 --> 01:28:03,407
Yes, but he never showed up.

1145
01:28:03,474 --> 01:28:04,270
She's lying!

1146
01:28:05,777 --> 01:28:07,608
- Your witness.
- When did you meet the defendant?

1147
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:09,613
The morning after the party.

1148
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:14,442
What did she tell you?

1149
01:28:14,519 --> 01:28:17,545
That she was Steve Brooks
reincarnated as a woman.

1150
01:28:18,857 --> 01:28:21,291
- What else did she tell you?
- That I shot him.

1151
01:28:23,261 --> 01:28:25,024
Who?

1152
01:28:25,096 --> 01:28:26,620
Him. Her.

1153
01:28:26,698 --> 01:28:30,361
- What else did she say?
- That God had sent him back.

1154
01:28:30,435 --> 01:28:34,394
- Would you mind speaking up, please?
- That God had sent him back...

1155
01:28:34,472 --> 01:28:37,066
and that he couldn't get into heaven
until he found...

1156
01:28:37,141 --> 01:28:39,905
one female who liked him.

1157
01:28:39,978 --> 01:28:43,744
- Him?
- Steve. Her.

1158
01:28:46,751 --> 01:28:48,514
But she was drunk.

1159
01:28:48,586 --> 01:28:50,554
No, I wasn't that drunk.

1160
01:28:54,225 --> 01:28:57,626
Do you swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth?

1161
01:28:57,695 --> 01:29:00,493
- So help me, God.
- State your name.

1162
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:03,892
Steven Brooks.

1163
01:29:05,403 --> 01:29:09,362
It's been five months, Walter.
You gotta get me outta here.

1164
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:10,930
I'm doing the best that I can.

1165
01:29:11,009 --> 01:29:12,772
- So how do you feel?
- How do I feel?

1166
01:29:12,844 --> 01:29:15,210
How the fuck do you think I feel,
Walter?

1167
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,305
I'm gonna have a baby.

1168
01:29:17,382 --> 01:29:20,681
It's your fucking fault. I'd like
to strangle you. That's how I feel.

1169
01:29:20,752 --> 01:29:24,449
Look I'm sorry. I don't know if you
recall, but you were very cooperative.

1170
01:29:24,522 --> 01:29:28,253
I simply do not choose
to accept that fact, Walter.

1171
01:29:28,326 --> 01:29:32,695
Drunk or sober, do you think
that for one cotton-picking second...

1172
01:29:32,764 --> 01:29:37,326
Steve Brooks would ever even consider
making love to another man...

1173
01:29:37,402 --> 01:29:39,393
Iet alone his best friend?

1174
01:29:40,538 --> 01:29:42,836
Steve Brooks? No.

1175
01:29:42,907 --> 01:29:46,604
- You still don't believe I'm Steve.
- I don't, and I'm gonna tell you why.

1176
01:29:46,678 --> 01:29:50,307
Three years ago, your birthday.
I sent you a little brunette.

1177
01:29:50,381 --> 01:29:53,043
- You called her Aztec.
- Hey!

1178
01:29:53,117 --> 01:29:55,483
Look, I don't know
how you know about that.

1179
01:29:56,554 --> 01:29:59,489
If Steve Brooks did get pregnant,
he'd have an abortion.

1180
01:29:59,557 --> 01:30:01,548
I nearly did.

1181
01:30:01,626 --> 01:30:04,493
Why'd you change your mind?

1182
01:30:04,562 --> 01:30:06,894
You're not gonna believe this, but...

1183
01:30:06,965 --> 01:30:09,024
there I was, lying on that table...

1184
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:12,069
and I had my feet
in those stirrupy things...

1185
01:30:12,136 --> 01:30:17,164
and all of a sudden,
it just came to me in a flash...

1186
01:30:17,241 --> 01:30:21,837
that maybe the only reason I wasn't
roasting somewhere in hell was--

1187
01:30:24,515 --> 01:30:27,313
was because God wanted me
to have this baby.

1188
01:30:28,386 --> 01:30:30,547
That's the only reason?

1189
01:30:30,621 --> 01:30:33,522
And making
the Guinness Book of Records.

1190
01:30:33,591 --> 01:30:35,422
I don't know.
I guess you really are Steve.

1191
01:30:37,161 --> 01:30:40,358
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. Oh, God!

1192
01:30:42,467 --> 01:30:47,234
Dr. Gold to O.B. room 501, please.

1193
01:31:20,371 --> 01:31:22,134
How'd you know it was me?

1194
01:31:22,206 --> 01:31:24,367
Old Spice.

1195
01:31:24,442 --> 01:31:28,105
And you tiptoe louder
than Gregory Hines tap-dances.

1196
01:31:29,914 --> 01:31:31,848
Don't punch him.

1197
01:31:40,358 --> 01:31:42,986
I talked to the doctor today,
you know?

1198
01:31:43,061 --> 01:31:44,926
Oh, yeah?

1199
01:31:45,997 --> 01:31:47,931
What'd he say?

1200
01:31:49,534 --> 01:31:51,468
He's worried about you.

1201
01:31:54,772 --> 01:31:56,967
Says you got high blood pressure...

1202
01:31:58,042 --> 01:31:59,202
and...

1203
01:32:00,111 --> 01:32:01,544
diabetes.

1204
01:32:04,315 --> 01:32:07,443
I'm a big girl, Walt.
Cut to the chase.

1205
01:32:09,787 --> 01:32:13,621
He said that if you carry
the baby to full term...

1206
01:32:13,691 --> 01:32:16,091
that there's a possibility
that you might--

1207
01:32:21,499 --> 01:32:22,693
Die?

1208
01:32:26,137 --> 01:32:27,866
What about the baby, Walter?

1209
01:32:28,973 --> 01:32:31,271
Well, see, that's the thing.

1210
01:32:31,342 --> 01:32:34,072
He said that if you decide
not to have the baby, then--

1211
01:32:34,145 --> 01:32:37,637
Oh, no.
I'm having the baby, Walter.

1212
01:32:38,716 --> 01:32:40,445
Can we talk about this?

1213
01:32:40,518 --> 01:32:43,214
No, we can't talk about this.

1214
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:53,396
You can't imagine what it's like...

1215
01:32:53,464 --> 01:32:55,659
to have a life inside you.

1216
01:32:55,733 --> 01:33:00,432
And it's growing, Walter.
It's moving.

1217
01:33:00,505 --> 01:33:02,905
It lives because I live.

1218
01:33:05,243 --> 01:33:07,734
And when I die...

1219
01:33:08,813 --> 01:33:10,747
there's a part of me that...

1220
01:33:12,617 --> 01:33:14,050
goes on.

1221
01:33:20,458 --> 01:33:22,392
It's a a truly amazing thing.

1222
01:33:24,962 --> 01:33:28,625
It is an honest-to-God miracle.

1223
01:33:33,237 --> 01:33:36,331
Which reminds me, you know...

1224
01:33:36,407 --> 01:33:40,503
just in case
what the doctor says is true...

1225
01:33:40,578 --> 01:33:42,170
you know--

1226
01:33:45,049 --> 01:33:48,348
How do you feel
about being a full-time father?

1227
01:33:51,022 --> 01:33:52,649
Great.

1228
01:33:52,723 --> 01:33:54,782
I knew you wouldn't
let me down, buddy.

1229
01:33:56,127 --> 01:33:57,719
Well...

1230
01:33:59,397 --> 01:34:02,195
don't you think
we ought to get married first?

1231
01:34:03,968 --> 01:34:06,869
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.

1232
01:34:10,041 --> 01:34:12,407
- I gotta get some rest here, Walt.
- Okay.

1233
01:34:15,813 --> 01:34:17,405
Good night, honey.

1234
01:34:18,249 --> 01:34:19,851
"Honey"?

1235
01:34:19,984 --> 01:34:22,680
Amanda, do you take Walter
to be your lawful wedded husband?

1236
01:34:30,628 --> 01:34:31,925
I do.

1237
01:34:34,198 --> 01:34:36,530
And do you, Walter, take Amanda
to be your lawful wedded wife?

1238
01:34:37,468 --> 01:34:38,730
I do.

1239
01:34:40,671 --> 01:34:42,104
The rings.

1240
01:34:43,841 --> 01:34:45,274
Oh, yeah.

1241
01:34:48,813 --> 01:34:52,112
With this ring I thee wed.

1242
01:34:58,222 --> 01:35:00,156
There ya go, Walt.

1243
01:35:02,627 --> 01:35:04,925
I now pronounce you...

1244
01:35:04,996 --> 01:35:06,588
husband and wife.

1245
01:35:21,312 --> 01:35:22,904
Mr. Stone.

1246
01:35:24,282 --> 01:35:25,715
Morning.

1247
01:35:27,785 --> 01:35:31,221
Walter,
I won't beat about the bush.

1248
01:35:32,156 --> 01:35:35,751
Your marriage has become
an embarrassment to the firm, so...

1249
01:35:36,928 --> 01:35:38,828
I'm going to have to let you go.

1250
01:35:41,365 --> 01:35:45,426
Well, I was gonna
quit anyway, Arnold.

1251
01:35:45,503 --> 01:35:49,735
See, I'm gonna become a father soon, and
it would really be an embarrassment...

1252
01:35:49,807 --> 01:35:52,640
for me to have to tell my kid
that I work for somebody like you.

1253
01:35:55,279 --> 01:35:57,975
Dr. Harrison to O.B. I. C. U.

1254
01:36:11,195 --> 01:36:12,423
- That's it. Hold on.
- Push!

1255
01:36:16,767 --> 01:36:19,201
- You gotta breathe a little.
- One more.

1256
01:36:19,270 --> 01:36:21,204
Yes, push.

1257
01:36:24,208 --> 01:36:26,608
That's it.
You're doing fine.

1258
01:36:28,713 --> 01:36:30,772
- That's it. Push. Good.
- No, don't!

1259
01:36:31,682 --> 01:36:35,812
You got it. Almost there now.
That's it. Very good.

1260
01:36:36,554 --> 01:36:39,182
Congratulations.
It's a girl.

1261
01:36:44,729 --> 01:36:46,321
Look.

1262
01:37:09,687 --> 01:37:11,746
- You know what, Walt?
- What?

1263
01:37:11,822 --> 01:37:13,756
I think she likes me.

1264
01:37:32,476 --> 01:37:36,105
- Something's wrong, Doctor.
- Get her B.P. Take the baby now.

1265
01:37:40,551 --> 01:37:44,146
What the hell's wrong?
She's not hemorrhaging.

1266
01:37:44,221 --> 01:37:46,314
- What's wrong? Amanda.
- Mr. Stone.

1267
01:37:48,092 --> 01:37:50,026
Somebody do something!

1268
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:02,537
Wow. What a beautiful baby.

1269
01:38:02,606 --> 01:38:04,597
Yes, you did well.

1270
01:38:04,675 --> 01:38:06,609
Wish I could be there
and watch her grow up.

1271
01:38:06,677 --> 01:38:08,611
Oh, you can watch her grow up.

1272
01:38:08,679 --> 01:38:12,513
But in the meantime you have to decide
whether you want to be a male--

1273
01:38:12,583 --> 01:38:14,676
Or a female angel.

1274
01:38:14,752 --> 01:38:18,552
Oh, he y. That's a tough one.

1275
01:38:18,622 --> 01:38:20,954
Okay if I think about it
for a while?

1276
01:38:39,677 --> 01:38:41,611
I love you, Mommy.

1277
01:38:52,356 --> 01:38:53,789
Let's go.

1278
01:39:00,598 --> 01:39:02,225
Have you made up your mind?

1279
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:06,293
Look, I don 't want to be a problem, but,
you know, it's not an easy decision.

1280
01:39:06,370 --> 01:39:09,362
- I really liked being a man.
- Naturally.

1281
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:13,035
- But being a woman had its advantages.
- Definitely.

1282
01:39:13,110 --> 01:39:15,374
Could I think about it
just a little longer?

1283
01:39:15,446 --> 01:39:19,883
Take your time.
You have all eternity.

1284
01:39:20,305 --> 01:39:26,473
