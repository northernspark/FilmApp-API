You know, unflattering

Mmm-hmm.

But what the warden <i>don't</i> know

00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:03,536
is it took me six months

Let me ask you something.

00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,517
Why?

511
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:18,980
Why you want to be on
the radio so bad that you're
gonna go through all this?

<i>It's</i> my thing, you know?

A reward for good behavior.

515
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:33,235
Couple years later,
I convinced them
to let me play this record

516
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:36,705
that my Aunt Pig had sent me,
a Sam Cooke record, man,

<i>That's</i> an incredible song.

518
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,669
She sent me that record,
you know, to try and give me
a little hope,

519
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:44,578
and I wanted to play it
for the men in them cells,

520
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,446
you know, give them some hope.

me from going stone-crazy

And now that <i>I'm</i> out,
I still need that.

524
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,092
Why should I put

this morning, P-Town?

1335
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:33,336
Say "Petey Greene goes
to the White House
and steals some <i>silverware."</i>

1336
01:18:33,408 --> 01:18:36,070
Now, come on,
that <i>don't</i> make no damn sense.

1337
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:39,238
Imagine that,
a negro like me, ex-con,

1338
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:41,441
get invited by the President
to the White House,

1339
01:18:41,516 --> 01:18:43,381
and <i>I'm</i> gonna run up in there
and take something?

1340
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:46,216

Well <i>that's</i> all we got.
There <i>ain't</i> no more.

1343
01:18:51,693 --> 01:18:54,025
My time is tight,
and <i>that's</i> the end of my show.

1344
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:57,361
So grab your head
and make a fist. Listen to me
and remember this,

1345
01:18:57,432 --> 01:18:59,866
I tell it to the hot,
I tell it to the cold.

1346
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:02,369
I tell it to the young,
I tell it to the old.

1347
01:19:02,437 --> 01:19:04,632
<i>Don't</i> want no laughing,

1348
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,708
And most of all,
no signifying.

1349
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:10,934
Tune in next week. This is
Petey <i>Greene's</i> Washington.

I know it sounds crazy,

I kind of miss
that little old radio station
