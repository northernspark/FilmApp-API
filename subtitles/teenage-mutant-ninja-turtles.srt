Mr. Rivetti. Mr. Rivetti, please.

You're the most persistent human
I've ever met in my life, I swear.

34
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,607
Look, l already
told the cops everything, all right?

35
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,727
But maybe there's a detail

36
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,006
you could've forgotten
to share with the police.

37
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,809
Sweetheart,
you don't forget something like that.

Ten guys storm in here, broad daylight,

force us to the ground at gunpoint.

40
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,240
And these are restricted chemicals.

41
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,803
Benzyl cyanide and some
deaminating agents, too.

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,281
You don't just buy this stuff,
even on the black market.

43
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,885
Wait, you said deaminating agents,

44
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,769
those are used in genetic research.

45
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,120
Is there anybody else

46
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,282
that's trafficking these
sort of chemicals besides you?

47
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,569
There's one other high-security facility
along this waterfront.

nearly as much cargo as we do.

Uh... No, no, no, I'll be right back.

51
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,720
Please don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

52
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,121
Come on, you're killing me.

53
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,326
I'm working.

54
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,680
- That's a paying job?
- No.

55
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,807
Because we have an actual paying job.

56
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,370
Look, you don't think that
every crime reporter

57
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,560
in the city isn't trying to work
this Foot Clan story?

58
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,443
I know that, but there is
a new angle on this,

59
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,841
and I am this close to getting it.

60
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,684
I just need a couple of more...

61
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,089
Let's just stick to what we're good at.

62
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,200
Let's stick to what we're
good at. We're good at it.

63
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,482
In five, four...

64
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,846
Hi, guys, this is April O'Neil
from Channel 6 News

65
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,763
and I am here in beautiful New York City

66
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,171
on the first day of spring.

67
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,571
And you know what that means.

68
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,967
It is time to shed
that pesky winter weight.

69
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,280
And here with me today

70
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,249
is celebrity fitness trainer
Harley Pasternak.

71
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,924
- Hi, Harley.
- Good morning, April.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,923
Twenty years I've studied
the animal kingdom.

73
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,600
There are fat pigs, there are fat cows.

74
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,801
There are no fat birds.

75
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,208
All right, I want you
to visualize a sexy seagull.

76
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,966
So we're going to squat down
and flap your wings.

77
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,520
Right over there. Full extension.

78
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,207
Picture you're leaving the cold north
and you're flying. You're migrating.

79
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,324
Four years of journalism school
so that I can do that.

80
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,289
Four years of my life, Vern.

81
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,285
It's embarrassing.

82
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,600
Look, O'Neil, I get it,

83
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,966
you want to be a serious journalist.

84
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,566
I see you sniffing around the newsroom
for the big stories.

85
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,803
But it's also okay
to just give people something

86
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,245
a little lighter. A little... Little froth.

87
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,521
- Froth?
- You know, how,

88
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,210
when you get a coffee,
it's just, like, coffee,

89
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,448
then they put a little froth on it.
It's kind of nice.

90
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,641
Vern, that's foam.

91
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,961
Yes, foam, froth, you get the point.

92
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,771
It's just... It's nice,
it tastes good, it's candy.

93
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,723
You ever heard the expression,
"Never take candy from a baby"?

94
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,888
It's because even babies love candy!

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,286
It's nice. And you're giving people

96
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,885
something they like that's good and nice.

97
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,282
They look at you and they see,
"Wow, there's a nice... There's...

98
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,927
"...candy." The point is, I think that

99
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,566
you should be rewarded,
not punishing yourself. Okay?

100
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,007
And I'm... I'm prepared to reward you.

101
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,003
I say that we go to my buddy's
old restaurant downtown.

102
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,081
It's very vibey...

103
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,366
We just ate on the way over here.

104
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,680
No, I know we just... I'm not saying

105
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,325
for a full meal,
we're just getting appeteasers.

106
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,006
I got to go finish that interview.
I'll see you at the office, Vern!

107
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,082
I will see you at the office!

108
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,130
I just wanted
to follow up, Mr. Rivetti.

109
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,083
<i>Are you kidding me?
How did you get my number?</i>

110
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,326
If I could just ask one more question.

111
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,320
<i>Listen, I already told you everything
I know about this crime, everything.</i>

112
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,364
<i>Okay, you wanna know anything else,</i>

113
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,568
<i>you go back down to the docks
and you see my guy Stan.</i>

114
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,680
<i>He'll tell you anything else
you need to know, okay?</i>

115
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,326
<i>And hey, do me a favor.
Lose my number, all right?</i>

116
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
Good.

117
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,284
It's clear.
Let's open it up.

118
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,760
Container's good.
Move on to the next one.

119
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,040
Move it out!
Get those to the trucks now!

120
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,164
Move out,
next point! Go, go, go.

121
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,484
- Channel 6.
- Chris.

122
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,005
Chris, it's April. I'm at the docks.

123
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,451
We're in the middle
of the evening brief, O'Neil.

124
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,681
Whatever you got can wait for tomorrow.

125
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,325
<i>No, no, I need...</i>

126
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,208
2-3-2, clear!

127
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,681
That one's loaded.

128
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,800
- Get it out of my way.
- Copy that.

129
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,686
Damn it.

130
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,520
Unit two, area three, move!

131
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,050
I've got movement!

132
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,446
Keep your eyes over here!

133
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,561
Weapons free!

134
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,563
Hold position!

135
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,645
Retreat! Retreat!

136
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,644
Get out of here!

137
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,371
Taylor. Taylor!

138
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,885
Hey. I'm Skyping with my mom.

139
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,206
You have no idea
what I just went through.

140
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,760
I am freaking out.
I saw a Foot Clan attack.

141
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,921
Are you okay?

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,360
I was riding my bike by the docks.

143
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,204
It was night, it's dark already

144
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,203
and there are
Foot Clan soldiers everywhere.

145
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,124
Then out of nowhere, there was this guy
fighting back against them.

146
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,208
And he... He left behind this symbol.

147
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,441
And I know that I've seen it before.

148
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,806
I can't remember where.

149
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,766
But there is someone fighting back
against the Foot Clan.

150
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,569
There is a vigilante in this city.

151
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,642
And no one knows, but I do.

152
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,529
I know. And now I have my story.

153
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,440
There is no more froth and foam for me.

154
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,325
What?

155
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,321
Never mind.

156
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,203
All right, we need
a lead for tonight. Who's got it?

157
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,645
"Major redevelopments proposed

158
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,324
- "for lower Manhattan."
- No.

159
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,410
I got something.
"NYPD task force taking credit

160
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,642
"for small decline in Foot-related crime."

161
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,762
- I like that. Let's run with that.
- Yes, ma'am.

162
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,127
<i>7:00 AM broadcast,
we have three minutes to air.</i>

163
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,685
Oh, O'Neil. I'll talk to you in a minute.

164
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,445
I know that I'm actually overstepping
my boundaries by being here,

165
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,642
but I think that you're gonna
want to hear what I have to say.

166
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,610
I actually think that you're all gonna want
to hear what I have to say.

167
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,125
Um, I witnessed

168
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,083
an attempted Foot Clan robbery

169
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,083
at the docks in Brooklyn last night.

170
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,282
Hold on, the scanner said
that gunshots were heard,

171
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,522
but there were no reports
of any Foot Clan activity.

172
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,881
That's because whatever they were
attempting to do was stopped.

173
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,086
What were you doing
in Brooklyn anyway?

174
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,810
Was there a trampoline convention?

175
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,530
I was in Brooklyn
because I was reporting,

176
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,160
not sitting behind my desk, McNaughton.

177
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,009
Okay, kids!

178
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,291
Who stopped it?

179
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,242
Well, there was this guy.

180
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,091
I didn't see him clearly,
but he was swinging

181
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,725
these giant shipping containers

182
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,446
and knocking these guys
into the... Into the river.

183
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,922
There is a vigilante that is fighting back
against the Foot Clan.

184
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,769
There's a huge story here!

185
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,521
O'Neil, I think you found Superman.
That's cool.

186
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,969
The vigilante is real. I saw him.

187
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,923
O'Neil, I'm gonna assume

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,446
that you would not
come up here and tell us

189
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,769
this fantastic story
without some tangible proof.

190
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,442
I took this photo of one
of the shipping containers.

191
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,131
I actually think that
it may be his calling card.

192
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,561
This is nothing, O'Neil.
This is nothing!

193
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,927
That's exactly the point. Somebody

194
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,209
stopped a Foot robbery
and left no evidence.

195
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,486
There is nothing.

196
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,289
Oh, I get it.

197
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,522
You wanted me to put "nothing"

198
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,290
- on the nightly news.
- Of course not.

199
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,562
You know, I'm gonna pretend
we never had this conversation.

200
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,210
I'm erasing it from my mind.

201
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,442
And the rest of us,
we're gonna go back to work.

202
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,567
Let's hit it!

203
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,407
<i>Hello, everybody.</i>

204
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,720
<i>Welcome to the Channel 6
Morning News.</i>

205
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,407
<i>New developments in that ongoing
sanitation strike to tell you about.</i>

206
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,204
But first, after reviewing the city's

207
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,601
soaring crime rates
with the police commissioner,

208
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,690
Councilman Dan Gregor
took to the steps of City Hall,

209
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,330
reaffirming the city's commitment

210
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,846
to fight against the rising
crime organization

211
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,291
calling themselves the Foot Clan.

212
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,971
He did so on the heels
of a renewed contract

213
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,644
with Eric Sacks and Sacks Industries.

214
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,202
<i>Using the Sacks research
and securities technology,</i>

215
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,362
<i>this city greatly improves its chances</i>

216
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,125
<i>of bringing the Foot Clan to justice!</i>

217
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,327
Begin!

218
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,486
Your men are weak.

219
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,084
It's no surprise your
missions fail.

220
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,162
We couldn't have anticipated
the vigilante

221
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,164
showing up at the docks,
Master Shredder.

222
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,521
You have been trained for
such contingencies.

223
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,401
But we've never seen an enemy like this.

224
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,121
Their size.

225
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,526
Their strength.

226
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,405
They're not human.

227
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,208
I don't believe in fairy tales.

228
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,965
It's what society wants
to reduce the Foot Clan to.

229
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,764
A myth.

230
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,490
But the Foot Clan

231
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,165
will rise again.

232
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,322
Capture the vigilantes however you can.

233
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,085
Use innocent people as bait.

234
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,204
No one will stop us in our quest

235
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,647
to reclaim victory.

236
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,446
We will own this city.

237
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,125
<i>Ladies
and gentlemen,</i>

238
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,409
<i>please join me in welcoming

240
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,291
<i>Please, please. Please.</i>

241
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,764
<i>Sit down, sit down.</i>

242
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,331
<i>I have to say,</i>

243
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,050
<i>it's wonderful to see so many
people out here tonight,</i>

244
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,045
<i>especially in a neighborhood
so hard hit by the Foot's crime wave.</i>

245
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,687
<i>Years ago, my life
was touched by tragedy.</i>

246
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,771
<i>I was a young scientist
working with a world-class team</i>

247
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,842
<i>on cutting-edge research.</i>

248
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,044
<i>And our laboratory was attacked,</i>

249
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,168
<i>set fire to, robbed,</i>

250
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,971
<i>by the cowards that
call themselves the Foot Clan.</i>

251
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,287
<i>Several of my employees</i>

252
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,121
<i>lost their lives that day.</i>

253
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,966
<i>And it is in their honor, in their memory,</i>

254
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,127
<i>that Sacks Industries,
whether through Sacks Biomed,</i>

255
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,527
<i>Sacks Robotics or Sacks Construction,</i>

256
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,965
<i>will remain committed</i>

257
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,926
<i>to keeping the city of New York, our city,</i>

258
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,166
safe.

259
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,204
<i>So whenever someone
takes flame to this city,</i>

260
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,326
<i>I will be there to put the fire out.</i>

261
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,651
<i>And that's a promise.</i>

262
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,291
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

263
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,129
<i>Thank you.</i>

264
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,886
Great work, sir. Very inspirational.

265
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,164
Mr. Sacks. April O'Neil.
You worked with my father.

266
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,446
Oh!

267
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,520
I can't believe it.
I haven't seen you since...

268
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,840
Since his funeral.

269
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,530
It was a long time ago.

270
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,563
Yeah.

271
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,251
I just wanted to tell you that your words
really resonated with me,

272
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,370
and I hope to one day contribute
to the city in the way that you do.

273
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,209
Well, it looks like you're
doing a pretty good job.

274
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,044
Channel 6, very impressive, April.

275
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,851
Um... Thank you. It's, uh...

276
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,249
it isn't exactly everything
I anticipated it would be.

277
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,886
As long as you are true to yourself,

278
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,361
your father will always be proud of you.

279
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,442
Mr. Sacks, we have to be uptown at 7:00.

280
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,801
I'll see you on TV.

281
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,401
Eric Sacks was so inspiring.

282
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,846
I know this is a story
that actually matters.

283
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,401
The superhero one?

284
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,240
That's a good idea.
I should chase that down.

285
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,245
Where's everybody going?

286
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,481
- O'Neil! Where are you going?
- Hey.

287
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,686
- April!
- Hey!

288
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,848
What are you running from? Wait, wait!

289
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,163
<i>Shots fired,
Broadway and Centre Street.</i>

290
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,605
Surveillance uplinks
are showing heavy,

291
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,967
heavy Foot Clan activity
at the Broad Street platform.

292
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,246
They're taking hostages, dude.

293
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,720
But you know
we're not supposed to go above ground.

294
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,966
We've done this before.

295
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,929
We started something, we gotta finish it.

296
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,411
This is insane.

297
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,529
That cat is playing <i>Chopsticks</i>
with chopsticks!

298
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,965
Don't be an idiot.

299
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,326
- Aw.
- Okay.

300
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,602
Let's rock 'n' roll, boys!

301
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,121
Run!

302
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,521
Get out!

303
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,926
Go, go!

304
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,324
If you want to live, do it! Go on!

305
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,968
Just stay down!

306
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,849
Get over here!

307
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,046
Keep moving!

308
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,600
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

309
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,840
Move to the side.

310
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,490
- They're bombs.
- Shut up!

311
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,686
On the ground!

312
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,130
Nobody move!

313
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,009
We know you're out there!

314
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,725
If you don't surrender,
we start executing hostages!

315
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,081
Get your head down!
Don't move!

316
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,520
Don't make me
tell you again! Not a word!

317
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,890
Don't look at me!

318
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,002
Don't! Don't do it!

319
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,965
You!

320
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,166
Stand up!

321
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,731
All aboard!

322
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,680
On your 12!

323
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,881
Come on!

324
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,647
That's right.

325
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,405
Like a shadow, bra.

326
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,924
How you like that?

327
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,250
Let's go! Let's move!

328
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,247
They went up that way!

329
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,361
Did you see that?

330
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,601
Here, here.
They climbed up here!

331
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,045
- Right here.
- Some kind of freak!

332
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,724
There were a couple of them!

333
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,325
Whoo! Right past me!

334
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,885
They saved us.

335
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,601
Go, go, go!

336
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,720
Let's go, guys! Both sides!

337
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,007
You see that?
I smoked that dude! S'up?

338
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,923
Yeah, boys, bring it in.

339
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,768
That was amazing.
You were incredible!

340
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,683
Great elbow, Donnie.

341
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,484
Oh, yeah!
That's what I'm talking about.

342
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,528
This is our city! These are our streets!

343
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,601
You mess with us,

344
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,409
you step into the Wu, whoo, Tang!

345
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,404
Ooh, yeah! Did you see that
guy's jaw connect with the concrete?

346
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,403
He'll be drinking
out of a sippy cup for months!

347
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,925
Ah, that's what
I'm talking about, brothers.

348
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,283
Like shadows in the night.
Completely unseen.

349
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,967
What was that?

350
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,371
It's a camera flash.

351
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,487
We know it's a camera flash.

352
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,449
Who's behind the camera flash?

353
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,965
By my calculations,
it's a girl.

354
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,041
Now we got to kill her...

355
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,326
- What?
- With kindness!

356
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,726
Give her some flowers, earn her trust.

357
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,605
- I got this.
- Raph, no, no, no! Come on!

358
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,729
Give me the camera.

359
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,371
Ooh, look,
he's doing his Batman voice.

360
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,480
She's so hot,
I can feel my shell tightening.

361
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,160
We can hear you!

362
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,129
If you don't give me
the camera, I'm gonna...

363
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,730
Enough!

364
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,446
Back off, Raph.

365
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,003
I only saw Batman once!

366
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,126
Ma'am, hello. I apologize.

367
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,003
My colleague here forgot to say "please."

368
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,601
So,

369
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,882
would you please hand over the camera?

370
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,527
No, no, no, no. Whoa.

371
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,922
Whoa. Chill. It's just a mask.
See? Don't freak out.

372
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,321
Right?

373
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,801
Ah!

374
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,803
<i>Oh, I think that went Well.</i>

375
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,928
Breathing steady.
Blood pressure stabilizing.

376
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,126
Why are we still here playing doctor?

377
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,167
She may have a head injury.

378
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,241
Uh, correction. She's a hot chick

379
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,243
who may have a head injury,
which makes it our civic duty to...

380
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,567
Ma'am, ma'am.

381
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,680
Can you hear me?
Do you know what city you're in?

382
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,922
Do you know where you are?

383
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,123
Have you seen that video where the cat
plays Chopsticks with the chopsticks?

384
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,850
Can we focus here?

385
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,651
Guys, please!
Come on. Give her some air.

386
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,085
What are you?

387
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,924
Well, Miss,

388
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,008
uh, we're ninjas.

389
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,167
We're mutants.

390
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,765
Well, technically, we're turtles.

391
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,205
Oh, and we're teenagers!

392
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,443
But we can still have
adult conversations.

393
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,244
Wait, wait, wait. So...

394
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,331
You're...

395
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,401
Ninja, mutant,

396
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,369
turtle, teenagers?

397
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,171
Well, when you put it like that,
it sounds ridiculous!

398
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,322
See, she's looking at us
like we're freaks.

399
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,320
I bet that's why you took
our picture, wasn't it?

400
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,004
To show your friends?

401
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,765
Bro, that's a good thing!
Maybe she has hot friends.

402
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,729
- Looking for this?
- Don't break it.

403
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,404
No, no, no. Please.

404
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,721
How many times do I have to tell you?

405
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,280
We don't break things, we fix them.

406
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,249
Donnie already wiped the phone, genius.

407
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,810
Problem solved, moving on.

408
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,048
- And who put you in charge?
- You know who did.

409
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,566
Ooh, tension!
It's been like 30 whole minutes

410
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,130
since you guys had this argument.

411
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,880
Leonardo, if we want to make it home
before Master, we gotta hustle.

412
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,845
Leonardo?

413
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,324
Do not say a word about this to anyone.

414
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,483
If you do, we will find you.

415
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,802
April O'Neil.

416
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,561
We're on the move, Raphael.

417
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,089
Raphael?

418
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,164
Yeah!

419
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,847
We'll find you, O'Neil.

420
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,727
I'm sorry, that came across
super creepy, okay?

421
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,040
We will find you, though.

422
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,931
I was on fire, bro!

423
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,324
Did you see me back there?

424
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,811
Guys, I totally talked to a girl!

425
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,405
Shut up, Mikey!

426
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,765
Yeah, bra!

427
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,166
Mikey, was that you?

428
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,765
Pepperoni.

429
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,009
Leonardo. I know those names.
I know those names.

430
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,682
Raphael, Raphael. Leonardo.

431
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,611
<i>Good</i> evening.

432
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,205
<i>This is April O'Neil,</i>

433
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,203
<i>reporting live from my daddy's lab.</i>

434
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,089
<i>I know it sounds pretty boring,</i>

435
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,686
<i>but actually,
he does some pretty cool stuff.</i>

436
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,490
<i>Time to put the camera away, April.</i>

437
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,642
Aw, Dad!

438
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,444
<i>And now I will show you</i>

439
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,488
<i>something amazing.</i>

440
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,769
<i>It's supposed to be
from a different planet</i>

441
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,444
<i>- in outer space!
- Here we go.</i>

442
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,245
<i>Ah!</i>

443
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,126
<i>Mr. Sacks,</i>

444
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,646
<i>what sort of experiments
are you doing here?</i>

445
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,331
<i>Oh, that's</i>
a <i>very complicated question.</i>

446
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,600
<i>We're trying to change the world.</i>

447
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,848
Look at the camera!

448
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,843
<i>Hello, Splinter.</i>

449
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,200
<i>And these are
my little turtles, Leonardo,</i>

450
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,084
<i>Raphael,</i>

451
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,004
<i>Michelangelo and Donatello.</i>

452
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,006
<i>The fans want to see you!</i>

453
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,366
I knew it.

454
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,767
The vigilante, I saw him.
I saw them! I saw them.

455
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,764
I've known them since I was a little girl.
They were my pets.

456
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,444
They were my childhood pets,

457
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,002
and they were named after
Italian Renaissance painters.

458
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,091
Mom, I want to move back home.

459
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,961
Is he here?

460
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,280
I don't see him.

461
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,361
Donnie?

462
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,011
My thermal scans indicate
there's a 74% variable

463
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,162
that there's a 61% chance he's not...

464
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,321
That he's not here, guys.

465
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,482
- That he's not here.
- Okay.

466
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,723
Fall in, quietly.

467
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,971
Dude.

468
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,809
So, guys, if it wasn't already
obvious with that girl,

469
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,607
dibs.

470
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,006
If Master Splinter catches us,

471
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,923
he'll send us back to the Ha'shi.

472
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,644
I ain't going back to the Ha'shi.

473
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,121
Every time we're in the Ha'shi,
it's because of you.

474
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,322
Well, bro, you won't have
to worry about me

475
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,731
dragging you down anymore.

476
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,450
What's that supposed to mean?

477
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,131
I'm going out on my own.
First chance I get.

478
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,362
How are we gonna finish our
hip-hop Christmas album, bro?

479
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,487
You're the hype man!

480
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,881
Shut up.

481
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,971
Shut up.

482
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,925
I got glop in my eye-

483
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,882
Shh! He's not going anywhere.
We all stick together.

484
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,405
Sorry I spit in your eye, bro.

485
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,925
- Shh!
- Guys? Guys.

486
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,004
We got a bogey.

487
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,285
Uh...

488
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,840
Where have you been?

489
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,922
We weren't...

490
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,002
I forgot to soak my retainer!

491
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,080
I'm totally sleepwalking!

492
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,328
Look, Mikey's sleeping and walking.

493
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,324
He's totally innocent.

494
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,326
Enough! You disobeyed a direct order.

495
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,607
Why did you go above ground?
What happened?

496
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,406
Very Well.

497
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,324
If that's how it's going to be,

498
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,602
to the Ha'shi!

499
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,689
O'Neil! All right, what was
so important I had to get here?

500
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,921
- Okay. Are you ready?
- Yeah.

501
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,570
Okay.
You know how

502
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,687
- I saw the vigilante?
- Yeah.

503
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,888
But I had no photos
or evidence to show you,

504
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,961
so I just sounded crazy.

505
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,690
- Yes.
- Okay. But I saw him again.

506
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,525
Well, I didn't see him again,
I saw them, because there's four.

507
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,721
There's not just one, there's four.

508
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,802
And I was standing as close to them
as you are to me right now.

509
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,411
What'd they look like?

510
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,720
I'll show you.

511
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
What?

512
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,521
Like this.

513
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,726
Like turtles?

514
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,490
Well, they don't look like turtles

515
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,367
because they are turtles.

516
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,762
They're over six feet tall
and they speak English.

517
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,011
Oh, my God.

518
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,560
I was awake all night, please look,
I was awake all night

519
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,449
googling all of the thwarted crimes

520
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,522
over the past three months,
and this symbol

521
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,284
appeared at every single one.

522
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,845
Look! Every single one of them.

523
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,167
This one, look.
Here, here, here, here, here.

524
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,527
And it's an ancient Japanese symbol
that means "family."

525
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,771
Wait, it's on my laptop.

526
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,842
I can't believe
you brought me in to do this!

527
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,570
It's here, it's here.

528
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,570
This is my father's lab.

529
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,125
This is the same lab

530
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,528
where these things were born
 or created or mutated.

531
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,086
Or, I don't know the terminology,
but will you please just look at what

532
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,441
I'm showing you and listen to me.
It's all connected.

533
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,124
The turtles are the vigilantes

534
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,202
and the vigilantes are these turtles.

535
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,645
Pizza <i>has cheese,</i>

536
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,246
<i>tomato sauce, all your favorite stuff.</i>

537
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,569
<i>Eat it. You guys need nutrition. Or not.</i>

538
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,966
I just want to be clear.

539
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,486
You are now telling me that there are

540
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,929
four six-foot talking turtles
walking around New York City,

541
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,570
and no one has seen them but you?

542
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,880
That's what I'm telling you.

543
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,729
I don't mean to laugh,

544
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,167
but is there anything else
we should know about them?

545
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,881
They're ninjas.

546
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,684
I'm sorry, what?

547
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,171
And they do karate.

548
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,765
Okay, get out.

549
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,561
O'Neil!

550
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,161
It could have been worse.

551
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,289
I just got fired, Vern.
How could it be worse?

552
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,481
Maybe it's good.

553
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,728
Maybe you should take a little time,
take care of yourself.

554
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,723
Come on, let me give you a ride.

555
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,484
Not unless you're going
to the Eric Sacks estate.

556
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,006
- April... Hey!
- I'm not giving up on this story.

557
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,844
You gotta put that to bed.

558
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,649
Would all of those other great reporters

559
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,688
that you worked with,
would they have "put it to bed"?

560
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,921
No. That's different.

561
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,843
How is it different?

562
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,605
They all started exactly
where I am, right?

563
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,725
I'm not driving the Channel 6 news van
onto the Sacks estate.

564
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,882
- Who asked you to do that?
- Uh, you did.

565
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,400
And a "thanks" would have been nice.

566
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,125
Maybe one day
you're gonna be thanking me.

567
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,205
So, what do you want with Eric Sacks?

568
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,760
My dad used to work for him.

569
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,966
He's the only person
that's gonna be able

570
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,804
to tell me whether or not I'm crazy.

571
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,126
Crazy about what?

572
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,201
I don't need you to laugh at me also.

573
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,281
Oh, come on, O'Neil.

574
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,889
This is the Fenwick Express,
it's a judgment-free zone.

575
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,246
A cocoon of safety.

576
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,890
Promise?

577
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,321
I'm insulted that
you would suggest otherwise.

578
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,562
Ooh, 11 hours in the Ha'shi.

579
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,325
Are you sure none of you want to tell me

580
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,131
where you were last night?

581
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,804
How you holding up, fellas?

582
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,681
Ah! I ain't breaking
if Donnie ain't breaking.

583
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,850
Experiencing intense nausea
but not breaking.

584
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,767
Guys? I'm in the zone!

585
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,730
There is literally nothing
that could break me right now!

586
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,285
Starting to break.

587
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,807
Of course, you've all tasted
the five-cheese pizza.

588
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,089
But this,

589
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,531
cheesemongers have speculated
of its existence for centuries.

590
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,525
Da Vinci's original masterpiece.

591
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,041
I submit to you...

592
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,764
...the 99-cheese pizza.

593
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,643
Oh!

594
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,768
It's not possible.

595
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,160
Mikey, it's a trap!

596
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,164
A pizza with that variety of cheese
is a culinary impossibility!

597
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,642
- Shall I list the ingredients?
- No.

598
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,165
Cheddar...

599
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,408
- Provolone...
- Mikey, don't you do it!

600
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,686
Asiago...

601
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,807
Keep it together!

602
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,041
Taleggio...

603
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,764
I don't even know what that is.

604
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,644
Mozzarella, of course.

605
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,210
All right, all right, all right!

606
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,408
We left the lair because the Foot
were taking hostages

607
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,766
and we kicked some serious butt,

608
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,490
and there was this girl
named April O'Neil

609
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,641
who took our picture,

610
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,846
but we took care of it.

611
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,410
Idiot.

612
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,485
Oh, no, my worst fears
have been realized.

613
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,483
Don't worry about it.
Donnie erased the picture!

614
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,766
We're not in danger.

615
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,368
No. It's April O'Neil who is in danger!

616
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,450
Find the girl. Bring her here.

617
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,971
But, sensei, you said to not go...

618
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,080
Find the girl!

619
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,201
Find the girl.

620
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,851
That's what I told Thompson
and she fired me.

621
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,605
So they're aliens?

622
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,123
No, that's stupid.

623
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,850
They're reptiles.

624
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,127
They help people, I guess.

625
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,966
Heroes in the half-shell.

626
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,001
- Okay.
- Come on. It's not that crazy. I...

627
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,810
The animal kingdom is full of...

628
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,689
I used to have a dog
that could moonwalk.

629
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,131
- Thanks for the ride, Vern.
- Yeah. No problem.

630
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,130
Nothing better than

631
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,726
dropping off a pretty girl
at a rich guy's house.

632
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,642
Hi, it's April O'Neil,
here to see Eric Sacks.

633
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,723
April's arrived early this year.

634
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,211
I'm sorry to barge in on you
like this, Mr. Sacks.

635
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,163
No, no, no. Please, please.

636
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,287
Thank you.

637
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,930
I've been working on a story.

638
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,048
And I have this theory that
there are these vigilantes

639
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,009
that are fighting back against the Foot.

640
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,651
I think you and my father
may have created them.

641
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,680
Uh, I'm not sure I...

642
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,683
Can you please tell me
everything that you know

643
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,569
about Project Renaissance?

644
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,801
Hmm.

645
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,760
Well, um, it was a dream.

646
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,964
A dream that died with your father.

647
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,326
What if it isn't dead?

648
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,323
That's impossible.

649
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,562
We lost all our research in the fire,

650
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,564
all our specimens, everything.

651
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,287
I've spent the last 15 years
trying to replicate the results.

652
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,250
You didn't lose everything in the fire.

653
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,801
- This can't be real.
- it is real.

654
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,723
I saw all four of them.

655
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,082
Do you really want to know
about Project Renaissance?

656
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,521
- Yes.
- Come with me.

657
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,770
I was born in Japan,
at a military base in Okinawa.

658
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,842
My father went to Vietnam.

659
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,364
Didn't come back.

660
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,926
I was an outsider in a foreign land.

661
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,481
A freak.

662
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,120
I was a powerless and helpless boy.

663
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,966
Until a local <i>sensei</i>
took me under his wing.

664
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,730
And he saved me.

665
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,246
Taught me lessons that I later
shared with your father.

666
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,931
Ninth-century Japan.

667
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,082
An evil warlord ruled the land.

668
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,210
He poisoned the water supply,
bringing on the dark ages.

669
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,124
Death and disease
and suffering ran rampant.

670
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,884
Not unlike the Foot Clan

671
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,769
and what they'd like to do to our city.

672
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,963
Then one day, a hero arose.

673
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,289
A great alchemist
discovered the antidote

674
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,050
to the warlord's poison.

675
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,804
The cure-all

676
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,123
for his evil.

677
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,130
Your father and I were trying
to recreate that cure-all.

678
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,368
We developed a mutagen

679
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,523
capable of stimulating self-repair

680
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,568
on a cellular level.

681
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,048
What were you going to do with it?

682
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,642
Imagine New York City,

683
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,244
being victim to a chemical attack.

684
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,405
This mutagen would be able
to reverse its effects.

685
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,926
It would save the city,
it would save the people.

686
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,806
Those test subjects, those turtles...

687
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:22,131
Running in their blood
is the last of this precious mutagen.

688
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,726
And up until a few moments ago,

689
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,369
I thought we failed.

690
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,847
I thought they died in the fire. How...

691
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,120
How could they have lived?

692
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,326
Because I saved them.

693
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,170
Of course you did.

694
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,921
April, the mutagen possesses powers

695
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,208
beyond our wildest hopes.

696
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,681
Whatever resources you need,

697
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,045
I'm here.

698
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,840
Let's work together. We'll find them.

699
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,884
The course of human history
may depend on it.

700
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,885
I'll show you out.

701
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,721
<i>Barn! You've been hacked!</i>

702
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,723
<i>By Donatello. Remember me?</i>

703
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,087
<i>Turtle. Four eyes. But enough about me.</i>

704
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,168
<i>We told you we'd find you.
Meet us here.</i>

705
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,561
And come alone. Or... Or <i>else</i> we're...

706
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,771
<i>You shall be punished and stuff.</i>

707
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,926
Hello?

708
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,242
You told me to come here.

709
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,120
I didn't bring anyone with me.

710
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,964
I did exactly...

711
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,606
Okay! Are you April O'Neil?

712
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,410
Initiating retinal scan.

713
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,760
Scanning, scanning, scanning, scanning.

714
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,446
Scan complete. It's her. It's her.
Guys, it's her!

715
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,130
Of course it's her, Donnie.

716
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,522
Hey. Really glad you could make it.

717
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,446
Hey. There's someone important
we want to introduce you to, but first...

718
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,806
Aw, yeah,
welcome to my crib, girl.

719
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,881
Where are we?

720
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,041
Hey,
it's our Fortress of Solitude.

721
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,200
Our Hogwarts.

722
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,321
Our Xavier Academy.

723
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,482
Our next generation,
state-of-the-art WonderDome!

724
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,403
Ugh.

725
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,970
Are we in the sewer?

726
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,280
No.

727
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,885
- Technically, yes.
- Yeah.

728
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,610
Yeah, it's a sewer.

729
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,090
You brought us here, April.

730
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,166
Splinter?

731
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,207
How does she know his name?

732
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,441
Did you tell her his name?

733
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,966
- Maybe she's clairvoyant.
- Maybe she's a Jedi!

734
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,890
Come closer.

735
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,162
It's been a long time.

736
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,366
Mmm.

737
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,128
You always did have your father's eyes.

738
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,004
I don't understand.

739
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:13,166
Don't be afraid. All will be made clear.

740
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,002
This is crazy.

741
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,086
Why are you here?

742
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,967
Student.

743
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,489
There's been a miracle.

744
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,727
The vigilantes who've been
causing us so much trouble?

745
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,167
They're the test subjects.

746
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,204
Those itty-bitty box turtles
that we thought we lost in the fire?

747
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,168
They're alive, Master Shredder.

748
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,203
And they've grown into something

749
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,611
powerful.

750
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,402
It won't be easy to capture
them, but if we can,

751
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,724
we can finally carry out the plan
that we had all those years ago.

752
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,447
My Foot Clan will have unlimited power.
And you will have your money.

753
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,763
The city will be ours.

754
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,287
Find them.

755
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,242
O'Neil's daughter
was the one who found them

756
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,443
and she will be the one who
will take us right to them.

757
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,406
There's the ping.

758
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,448
We've breached the cloaking security.

759
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,600
<i>Listen closely, April.</i>

760
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,364
I don't remember a time

761
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,602
before living in that laboratory.

762
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,647
That fateful night started like any other.

763
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,371
<i>Sacks gave us our injections.</i>

764
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,887
<i>Your father made sure
our vital signs were strong.</i>

765
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,609
<i>And you, as always,</i>

766
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,160
<i>provided us with a special treat.</i>

767
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,768
<i>After the brothers went to sleep,</i>

768
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,650
<i>I heard loud voices.</i>

769
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,802
<i>There was the smell of smoke.</i>

770
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,008
<i>Alarms sounded.</i>

771
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,082
<i>Your father had discovered the truth</i>

772
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,731
<i>behind the man he was working for.</i>

773
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,569
<i>He set fire to the lab.</i>

774
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,162
<i>His last breath was taken</i>

775
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,364
<i>trying to destroy Shredder's plan.</i>

776
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,130
<i>I was terrified.</i>

777
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,168
<i>But then, you appeared.</i>

778
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,842
<i>And ushered us to safety.</i>

779
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,446
<i>I never had a voice then,</i>

780
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,921
<i>but I thank you now, April.</i>

781
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,721
Mmm.

782
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,762
We wandered the sewers
until I found this place.

783
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,962
<i>It was then that the mutagen</i>

784
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,769
<i>that was injected into our blood</i>

785
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,681
<i>began to change us in miraculous ways.</i>

786
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,771
<i>I saw how your father loved you</i>

787
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,805
<i>and I knew I had to show
that same love to the turtles.</i>

788
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,605
<i>I became their father</i>

789
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,331
<i>and they became my sons.</i>

790
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,727
<i>Like all children, they were drawn
to the distractions of popular culture.</i>

791
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,566
<i>And I knew one day they would
want to explore the world above.</i>

792
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,082
<i>They would be ridiculed.</i>

793
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,806
They would need to learn
to protect themselves,

794
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,167
both mentally and physically.

795
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,487
Hey. Does anyone
want to play Buck-Buck?

796
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,081
Buck one!

797
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,361
Buck two!

798
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,851
Buck three!

799
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,206
Where you going, Raph?

800
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,691
Come on.
I can't do it by myself.

801
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,841
I need all four!

802
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,160
You're a Buck short.

803
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,444
Yeah, that sounds stupid.
Like you, Mikey!

804
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,000
That's why you're just the hype man, bra.

805
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,040
- See these moves?
- Yeah, whatever, man.

806
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,485
And then <i>I</i> found a way.

807
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,770
<i>First, I would teach myself
the ancient art of Ninjutsu.</i>

808
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,441
Oh!

809
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,601
<i>The brothers followed my lead,</i>

810
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,286
<i>accelerating at a wondrous rate!</i>

811
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,563
Wassup, bra? Want some of this?

812
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,846
I'm like a ghost!

813
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,400
I'm over here, now I'm over here, bra.
Like a shadow!

814
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,642
I'm a flame shadow fire dragon!

815
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,848
Ow!

816
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,403
<i>Their gift
was also their passion.</i>

817
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,721
<i>They lived, breathed and dreamed</i>

818
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,165
<i>all things martial arts.</i>

819
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,411
<i>Then, they were ready.</i>

820
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,322
The katana, most noble of all the blades.

821
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,842
It is the weapon of a leader.

822
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,691
<i>Everything they are,</i>

823
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,367
<i>and everything that they've become</i>

824
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:18,246
<i>was made possible by the bravery that
you displayed on that fateful night.</i>

825
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,166
Dude.

826
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,929
I was just a little girl.

827
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,805
And you gave us freedom

828
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,962
where others
would have kept us in cages.

829
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,246
Wait a minute, Dad.

830
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,641
All these years you told us
we were rescued from the fire

831
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,963
by a great guardian spirit, the Hogo-sha.

832
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,883
That's right.

833
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,043
And this is the Hogo-sha.

834
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,284
What?

835
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,491
My girlfriend's totally the Hogo-sha.

836
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,721
Ow.

837
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,769
Fortunately, our engineers
have been making great progress

838
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,401
in refining the robotics in your armor.

839
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,608
We're taking it to the next level,

840
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,251
bridging the gap
between ancient tradition

841
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,084
and modern warfare.

842
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,884
Tonight, I dine on turtle soup.

843
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,091
Why did you bring me here?

844
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,443
To find out who you told of our existence.

845
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,406
Nobody that believed me,
except for Eric Sacks.

846
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,205
Sacks.

847
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,649
Just as I feared.

848
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,445
Sacks is not a friend.

849
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,363
His soul has been poisoned

850
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,522
by the influence of a dark master.

851
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,968
The Shredder.

852
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,806
Shredder practically
raised Sacks in Japan.

853
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,882
He's like a father to him.

854
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,849
Sacks will do anything for his master.

855
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,123
Wait, wait.

856
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,884
Sacks and Shredder?

857
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,760
So, why aren't we out there
hunting them down?

858
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,126
Because, Raphael,

859
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,686
The Shredder is a skilled warrior

860
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,331
whose cruelty is ever-reaching!

861
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,244
And you are just teenagers.

862
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,164
The mutagen in your blood
is of great value to them.

863
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,762
Now that Sacks has confirmation
that you are alive,

864
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,442
I fear they will bring the fight to us.

865
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,241
Oh, no.

866
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,160
Stand by
to make entry. Let's move!

867
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,525
Go, go, go!

868
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,130
Perimeter infringe.
Breached! We have incoming!

869
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,881
Oh, no! Oh, no! We got two breaches.

870
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,564
Fan room, weapons wall!

871
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,529
Mikey, flank right!
Donnie, on me!

872
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,806
We gotta go! Go, go!

873
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,522
Stand by to set charge.

874
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,681
Lock and load. We're going on 10.

875
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,963
No live ammo. Tranqs only.

876
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,405
Take 'em alive!

877
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,371
No! Get back!

878
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,721
Donnie!

879
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,646
Engage!

880
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,801
Get him!

881
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,730
There they are! Neutralize them!

882
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,643
They've got tranq darts!

883
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,210
Well, don't let them hit your skin.

884
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,330
Let's go! Let's move!

885
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,165
Over there!

886
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,401
Tango at 12!

887
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,766
Wassup, bra? Oh, you think
you can handle this, huh?

888
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,525
I'm a snapping turtle, fool.
Snap, snap, snap!

889
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,808
I meant to do that! I meant to do it!

890
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,167
We got a breach in the fan room!

891
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,366
Raph! Get to the fan room!

892
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,966
Why are you always telling me
what to do?

893
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,888
Just go! Mikey, you gotta get
April out of here, now!

894
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,730
I got this!

895
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,607
April, come with me.

896
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,767
I got a safe place for you to hide.

897
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,047
And if you get thirsty,

898
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,044
I got a secret stash of
Orange Crush behind the fridge.

899
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,241
Don't tell Raph.

900
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,644
Shredder.

901
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,889
All these years

902
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,123
I've been trying to recreate the mutagen.

903
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,651
And you?

904
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,162
You just handed it to me.

905
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,850
You will not lay a hand on my sons.

906
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,684
Your sons?

907
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,523
You think you're their father?

908
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,842
Very good, rat!

909
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,931
<i>Sensei!</i>

910
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,841
Donnie!

911
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,605
Hang on, Leo! Be right there!

912
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,051
You stupid little girl!

913
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,446
April!

914
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:49,761
<i>Sensei!</i>

915
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,683
No, my son, stay back!

916
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,651
<i>Sensei!</i>

917
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,406
<i>Sensei! Dam!</i>

918
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,851
Dad! What are you...
What are you doing?

919
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,331
Hide!

920
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,687
No!

921
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,603
Save yourselves!

922
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,370
Children, drop your weapons,

923
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,365
or your father will die.

924
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,091
No!

925
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,570
Where's the fourth?

926
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,603
He's dead.

927
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,966
Destroy this place.

928
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,091
Keep moving!

929
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,365
Stay strong.

930
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:58,287
Remember, pain's only in the mind.

931
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,807
Move along! Go!

932
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,451
Troop, go!

933
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,040
Move! Move!

934
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,165
Splinter.

935
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,205
Sensei.

936
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,201
Master.

937
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,762
Let's get him to the needle room.

938
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,685
Package is secured. En route.

939
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,121
<i>We're carrying three specimens</i>

940
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,680
<i>and will be arriving at the estate
in approximately 40 minutes.</i>

941
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,362
Prepare the containment units.

942
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,210
Inside those turtles

943
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,051
is the most precious compound on Earth,

944
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,881
mutagen.

945
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,243
And we will drain every last
ounce of their blood to get it,

946
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,249
even if it kills them.

947
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,564
Get the first aid kit! On the shelf!

948
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,563
Hurry. Hurry.

949
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,411
Raphael?

950
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,765
I'm here.

951
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,401
You must save your brothers.

952
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,763
Stop Shredder.

953
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,651
<i>Sensei.</i>

954
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,285
It's some kind of tracker.

955
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,050
It's Donatello!

956
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,365
Go, Raphael.

957
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,204
Let's go save my brothers.

958
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,725
We need a ride.

959
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,885
O'Neil!

960
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,291
<i>Look, Vern,
I need you to meet me</i>

961
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,528
at Cortlandt Alley in 10 minutes, please.

962
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,641
Wait, why?

963
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,563
<i>I can't talk to you about it on the phone.</i>

964
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,721
<i>Just promise you're gonna be there.</i>

965
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,485
What do you mean, you can't
talk about... You called...

966
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,721
...me.

967
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,246
All right. Want me
to meet you right now?

968
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,483
I'll play your little game.

969
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,761
What's with the hat?

970
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,921
What is with the...

971
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,081
I don't know,

972
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,003
it's a buddy of mine's. It's just a goof.

973
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,288
What do you want to do?
You wanna head downtown?

974
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,249
Eric Sacks is working with
the head of the Foot Clan.

975
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,685
They just kidnapped the vigilante turtles

976
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,120
to take them to the Sacks estate.

977
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,207
We need to go. Come on, Vern.

978
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,802
Right, right, right. The turtles. I forgot.

979
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,525
This is getting embarrassing.

980
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:01,366
O'Neil,
we're both consenting adults.

981
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:04,882
We're both very good-looking.
You're better, probably.

982
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,007
That's up for debate.

983
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,202
But the point is, we don't
need to make up excuses

984
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,884
- to hang out with each other.
- What?

985
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,048
You want to spend more time
with me. I get it. I would too.

986
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,281
We need to get to the Sacks estate

987
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,360
right now, Vern. Come on!

988
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,401
That's what I'm talking about, O'Neil.

989
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,891
"The Sacks estate with the vigilante..."

990
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,530
- What...
- Drive!

991
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,362
You're a talking turtle.

992
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,442
Yeah. Yeah, I'm a talking turtle

993
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,131
and you're a human nerd.

994
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,168
Now that we got that
out of the way, hit it.

995
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,645
I've never been accused
of being a nerd before, but...

996
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,370
I'm sorry...

997
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,088
How did you get in...
How did he get in the...

998
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,567
Oh, my-

999
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:07,881
Wow.

1000
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,845
Unbelievable. Let me look at you.

1001
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,447
I'm a hard guy to impress, but...

1002
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,325
This is just...
Oh, my God.

1003
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,841
Wow!

1004
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,286
And we were gonna use rabbits!

1005
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,842
Can you imagine that?

1006
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,561
All we were trying to do
is create an antidote.

1007
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,045
For what?

1008
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,444
Say that again. I want to hear your voice.

1009
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,371
For what?

1010
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,881
Wow.

1011
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,965
Well, uh, we had this plan.

1012
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:48,363
A plan that we're ready
to put back online today.

1013
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,805
I'll show you. Karai, um...

1014
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,120
Show them.

1015
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,720
What?

1016
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,404
Do you know my building, Sacks Tower?

1017
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,687
Got that great big spire up on top?

1018
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,690
That spire is filled...

1019
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,842
...with tons of chemical toxins.

1020
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:07,967
No! No!

1021
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,281
Bad stuff.

1022
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,641
That kinda bad.

1023
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:23,121
In a few hours, Shredder is going to
unleash all that stuff over the whole city.

1024
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,891
The initial death toll will shake
world governments to their core.

1025
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,210
In 30 days, the city of New York
will be a quarantine zone.

1026
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,083
And that is where my company comes in.

1027
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:43,086
I'm going to save everyone
with the antidote

1028
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:48,047
that is made from the mutagen
that is oozing through your blood.

1029
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:52,683
The government will then send
Sacks Industry a blank check

1030
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:57,362
and I'm going to be rich.
Like, stupid rich.

1031
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:02,525
Shredder will force this city
to live under our rule.

1032
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,727
We will be gods.

1033
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:12,366
Yeah, I've thought about...

1034
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,441
I've thought about doing,

1035
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:16,370
not becoming a ninja, but
I was doing a bunch of yoga

1036
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,882
for like, 10 days at one point, and,
uh, I pulled a hamstring.

1037
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,760
- There's the gate right there.
- There it is.

1038
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,201
Ram the gate.

1039
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,642
"Ram the gate"?
This is Channel 6 property.

1040
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,444
I said ram the gate!

1041
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,370
All right, everybody, strap in!

1042
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,407
<i>Oh, Shit!</i>

1043
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,481
Go, go, go, go!

1044
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,526
Follow me!

1045
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,404
I'll take this canister to New York
to withdraw the mutagen.

1046
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:10,251
Make sure that you drain all their blood.

1047
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,568
Time to take a bite out of the Big Apple.

1048
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,690
Hey! Get out of here!

1049
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,366
Leo!

1050
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,604
About time.

1051
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,121
What the...

1052
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,081
Raphael.

1053
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,444
Glad you could join us.

1054
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,644
The fourth cage is for you.

1055
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,011
That's harsh, man.

1056
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,683
The rat did not teach you well!

1057
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,845
Raphael!

1058
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,365
You.

1059
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,125
Focus on me.

1060
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,202
Three... Four total turtles.

1061
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,046
One's fighting a robot samurai. Why not?

1062
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,247
Donnie!

1063
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,361
Donnie!

1064
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:02,881
What do I do?

1065
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,044
- Adrenaline.
- What?

1066
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:06,811
Adrenaline.

1067
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,485
Adrenaline.

1068
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,326
All right. All right.

1069
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,405
Adrenaline.

1070
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,724
He's going to kill him.

1071
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,560
Get up!

1072
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,081
It's working.

1073
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,610
I think we should move.

1074
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:13,845
Oh! I feel really good right
now! I feel like running!

1075
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,803
I feel like cleaning!
Who wants to clean the dojo?

1076
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,291
I'll clean the dojo!

1077
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:18,721
Endorphins! Endorphins!

1078
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,040
We got to get Raph!

1079
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,201
Raph! Raph!

1080
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,441
Are you okay?
Are you dead? Are you okay?

1081
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,209
Come on. Come on.

1082
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,281
We really gotta go!

1083
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,521
- Go where?
- Sacks Tower!

1084
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,567
New York City! Times Square!

1085
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,801
Shredder's going to release a toxin!

1086
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:34,967
It's gonna poison the whole city!

1087
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,644
And Sacks is gonna sell the antidote!

1088
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,727
Made from the mutagen

1089
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,802
- That's in our blood!
- So we've got to get going now!

1090
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,809
Good. Let's do it for sensei.

1091
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:42,961
Okay. We're going!

1092
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:46,328
Everybody calm down!
Look how calm l am!

1093
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,404
We got to move. Let's go!

1094
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,645
Sacks is airborne!

1095
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,325
Flight time to Manhattan, 19 minutes!

1096
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,283
Get us out of here, Donnie!

1097
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,330
Oh, my gosh, they have guns!

1098
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,011
Get down!

1099
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,325
Ha! Are you guys okay?

1100
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,760
We're bulletproof.

1101
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:19,841
Sweet!

1102
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,285
Advance and engage!

1103
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,001
Can you drive that truck?

1104
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,160
Yeah!

1105
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,850
We're on Raph. Ready?

1106
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:48,881
Come on!

1107
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:54,206
Everybody in the truck!
We gotta go, go, go! Move!

1108
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,000
Vern, you know how to drive this, right?

1109
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,321
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just got to
hotwire this thing, I guess.

1110
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:59,885
Classic blue wire/red wire situation.

1111
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,240
- Keys!
- Yeah.

1112
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:02,731
Keys are better.

1113
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,203
- Drive!
- I'm on it!

1114
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:06,680
Come on! Come on!

1115
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,880
That's all I need is a
backseat-driving talking turtle!

1116
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,920
- Let's go!
- Move!

1117
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,931
Jackal-One-Tango, on your 12!

1118
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,126
<i>Copy</i> that.

1119
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,844
I shouldn't have doubted you.

1120
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,251
Sorry I didn't stick up for you.

1121
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,040
I can't believe that you're
not crazy! How crazy is that?

1122
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,531
Target, 12 o'clock!

1123
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,011
Where are we going, guys?

1124
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:45,000
Donnie, what's the fastest
way back to Manhattan?

1125
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,087
We just need to stay on this road.

1126
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,207
If we can get to the maintenance hatch

1127
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,361
at the bottom of the hill,

1128
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,204
there's a sewer line 2.4 miles from here.

1129
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,408
Mikey! Let them know up there!

1130
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:53,761
I'm on it!

1131
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,731
Oh, no.

1132
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,641
Vern, go, go, go, go, go!

1133
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:28,721
I'm on it!

1134
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,801
Stop!

1135
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:33,921
Vern, hit the brakes!

1136
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:35,121
Wrong way! Wrong way!

1137
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,171
Go around! Go, go, go!

1138
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,487
Leo, move, move!

1139
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:39,641
What?

1140
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,680
Opposite, opposite, opposite!

1141
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,924
Oh, no!

1142
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,684
How far off course are we?

1143
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,490
Actually, we're on a bit of a shortcut.

1144
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,244
But we need to keep going down.

1145
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,321
Straight down.

1146
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:57,526
Hey!

1147
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,011
Just keep

1148
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,922
going straight!

1149
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,764
What's up, angel cakes?

1150
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:17,841
Fire!

1151
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,167
Guys, Leo's in trouble!

1152
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,726
My shell's cracked. Just tape it up.

1153
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,882
Allow me to be the bad-ass for once.

1154
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,961
Hang on, Leo. Disengaging.

1155
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,766
God, I've always wanted to try this.

1156
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:12,564
I got you, brother.
One car down, two to go.

1157
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,001
Mikey!

1158
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:19,767
All right, that's it.
I'll take it from here!

1159
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,082
Whoo-hoo!

1160
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,761
Raph, I'm driving! Yeah!

1161
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,284
Whoo-hoo!

1162
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,284
O'Neil, what are you doing?

1163
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,450
Yeah, that's good. Make sure
you're getting everything.

1164
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:58,411
Vern!

1165
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,091
Vern!

1166
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,767
O'Neil! Give me your arm!

1167
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,446
Vern!

1168
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,121
Avalanche!

1169
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:10,811
Whoa!

1170
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,651
Come on, Leo, wake up!

1171
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,161
Yeah! If you wake up,

1172
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,322
I promise to do anything you say!

1173
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:26,730
Guys! Shredder's chopper is 20 miles

1174
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,848
outside of New York City airspace!

1175
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,844
Thanks for the traffic update, Donnie.

1176
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,769
You doing sports and weather next?

1177
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,161
If you're gonna be nasty about it

1178
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,327
then I guess you don't want to know

1179
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,482
that there's a 500-foot
drop-off in 53 seconds!

1180
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,601
Are you saying there's...

1181
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:39,681
A cliff!

1182
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:44,243
We gotta get April out
of there! Raph, heads up!

1183
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,842
Don't forget that old guy!

1184
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,606
Hi. Change of plans. Oh, come on.

1185
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,365
Guys, get down! Get down!

1186
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,371
Twelve seconds
and we're going over!

1187
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:12,291
Hey, Donnie,
do that fancy slingshot thing!

1188
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,362
We got to take Little Miss Sunshine out!

1189
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,045
Batter up!

1190
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,800
Grab on.

1191
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,005
Mikey! Grab the cable!

1192
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,402
I got it! I got it!

1193
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,641
Hold on! Hold on!

1194
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,562
on, no!

1195
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,201
No, no, no!

1196
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,241
Oh, no...

1197
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,522
Poor Leo, April...

1198
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,091
And that other guy.

1199
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,083
They were so young, so beautiful.

1200
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,242
They ain't dead, numb nuts.

1201
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,521
Oh. Right on.

1202
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,562
I hope you got a parachute
under that shell.

1203
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,922
Hey, guys! It's the maintenance hatch!

1204
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,161
Our ticket home!

1205
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,571
A little help, please!

1206
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:29,443
Guys, we gotta hustle.
Shredder's over New York City!

1207
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,887
<i>Sensei,
the mutagen is four minutes out.</i>

1208
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,886
<i>Moving forward as planned.</i>

1209
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:01,801
Please keep your arms and legs

1210
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,644
inside the shell at all times.

1211
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,166
Satellite imagery shows

1212
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,089
Shredder's reached the top
of Sacks Tower.

1213
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,491
If that's where he's releasing
the toxin from...

1214
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,011
It's gonna
spread all over the city!

1215
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:11,286
We need to...

1216
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,725
...break a left!

1217
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,401
All right, listen up.

1218
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,602
We gotta find the elevators
and get up to the roof.

1219
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,842
You guys get out of here.
Get to a safe distance.

1220
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,331
No, no, we can go find Sacks

1221
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,640
and get our hands on the
mutagen as a contingency plan,

1222
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,121
just in case... You know.

1223
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,090
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

1224
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,682
If we don't make it back,
bring the mutagen to Splinter.

1225
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,131
It can save his life.

1226
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,521
Sacks's laboratory's on the 36th floor.

1227
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,922
I've already disabled the security system.

1228
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,849
Oh, and, uh...

1229
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,360
Good luck!

1230
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,761
If I don't return, remember me, April.

1231
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,203
You can always find me

1232
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,211
in here.

1233
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,840
You're a complicated chick.

1234
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,163
Yeah.

1235
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,680
Elevator's just around this corner!

1236
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:27,721
All right, guys, listen up.

1237
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,723
We stick to my plan and we won't fail.

1238
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,280
Fan out in three, two, one.

1239
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,241
Whoa.

1240
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,609
Not the elevator.

1241
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,606
Nope.

1242
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,924
<i>The first vial
is filling with antidote now.</i>

1243
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:04,084
Initiating
the toxin release procedure.

1244
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:26,449
MC Mikey.

1245
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,124
MC

1246
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,849
Ready, stance!

1247
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,243
Hey, Mikey, remember that
thing you used to say

1248
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:08,560
when we were kids?

1249
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:09,841
You made me promise
never to say it again.

1250
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,046
Forget about that.

1251
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:12,804
Still got one in the tank?

1252
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,365
I've been holding it in for years.

1253
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,601
Guys, we need a plan!

1254
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,330
Cowabunga!

1255
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,690
Leo!

1256
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,965
Yeah, we got a 10-10.

1257
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,371
Debris falling from the building.

1258
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:43,361
Come on.

1259
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,201
I got this, guys!
I'll take him!

1260
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:00,726
Come on!

1261
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,042
Oh, no, you don't!

1262
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,640
Seriously,

1263
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,161
you two...

1264
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,401
You're adorable, really.

1265
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,249
I could just pinch your cheeks!

1266
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,800
Ugh, guys,
he's coming, he's coming!

1267
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,971
Guys!

1268
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,521
Donnie!

1269
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,842
Come on, come on!

1270
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,605
Hold on, Leo!

1271
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:55,161
I understand a girl
with dead daddy issues.

1272
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:57,129
I do. But you're not gonna stop me.

1273
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:59,451
This is history

1274
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,521
repeating itself.

1275
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,683
Your father walked in on me,
April, just like you did.

1276
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,800
It took a few less bullets
to take him down, though.

1277
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,480
You killed my father.

1278
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,407
Move! Move!
Go, go, go!

1279
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,485
Come on, guys!

1280
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,165
Got you!

1281
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,648
Enough. The lesson is over.

1282
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,800
Ugh! We're getting
our asses kicked out there.

1283
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,368
We only got 50 more seconds
before the toxin's released.

1284
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,606
Hey-

1285
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,284
Who wants to play Buck-Buck?

1286
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,486
Buck-Buck?

1287
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,369
- What?
- Buck-Buck. Tony-on-a-Pony.

1288
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,761
Some people call it Johnnie-on-a-Rock.

1289
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:25,961
Wait.

1290
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:27,726
Yeah.

1291
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,689
Let's play Buck-Buck.

1292
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:32,486
- But why would we...
- No.

1293
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,801
We do what Leo says.

1294
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,291
Lead the way.

1295
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:48,761
O'Neil!

1296
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,931
Argh!

1297
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:08,960
Hmm.

1298
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,449
Oh!

1299
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:54,122
Cowabunga.

1300
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,131
Are you okay?

1301
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,561
Look, just go get some help
and take the mutagen with you.

1302
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,489
- Just go. Go!
- No!

1303
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:08,805
Just another day in the life
of a man of action.

1304
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,610
Ow. No, I'm not getting up.

1305
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,440
You know how to use this thing?

1306
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:14,931
It's a simple command-line interface.

1307
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,405
No one's used this code in 15 years.

1308
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,891
I mean, I've read about it online.

1309
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,970
But these kind of things take time.

1310
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,243
Thinking there was no way
I'd ever be in a position

1311
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:28,526
where the fate of an entire city

1312
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:30,409
would rest on whether
or not I could hack out antiquated code

1313
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,481
on an antiquated system.

1314
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:34,924
I'll buy you some time.

1315
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:46,205
<i>Toxin disbursement</i>

1316
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,886
<i>in five, four,</i>

1317
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,521
three,

1318
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,526
two...

1319
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,526
Bam! System disabled!
Who wants Italian?

1320
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,285
I'm buying! Tiramisu for everybody! Ah!

1321
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,087
Ah.

1322
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,530
Fall in!

1323
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:25,124
Hold on! Hold it! Hold it!

1324
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:31,803
If the spire falls and the
toxin makes ground impact,

1325
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,723
it'll contaminate a 10-block radius!

1326
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,920
What are the odds of us
stopping that from happening?

1327
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:39,921
Uh, 0.00000000003%!

1328
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:44,850
I'll take it.
Nobody moves, no matter what.

1329
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,406
But, Leo...

1330
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,846
I said nobody moves!

1331
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:54,685
Leo, I'm letting go!

1332
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,481
Ah!

1333
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,445
Shredder!

1334
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,924
This is all that's left!

1335
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,411
Little girl.

1336
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:14,161
That belongs to me.

1337
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,447
Hold on! Hold on! Hold it!

1338
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,407
Get back! All the way back!

1339
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:57,801
April!

1340
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,804
Come on, guys!

1341
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:12,401
Ah!

1342
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,164
April!

1343
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,761
Got you, Raph!

1344
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:23,324
Hold on! Hold on! April!

1345
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,405
I got you.

1346
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:36,888
Swing me towards him!

1347
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,326
Do it!

1348
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:44,321
Leo!

1349
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,043
That's my girl.

1350
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,688
I think this is it, guys!

1351
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,888
Does anyone have anything
they want to say?

1352
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,487
Donnie?

1353
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,211
I'm the one who licks the icing
off the Pop-Tarts every morning

1354
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:44,725
and puts them back in the box.

1355
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:45,967
No, no, no, no!

1356
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:50,920
I so did not understand
the ending of <i>Lost.</i>

1357
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:56,921
Raph?

1358
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,251
I just, uh...

1359
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:02,248
If this is our last moment together,

1360
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:05,244
I just want you guys to know I'm sorry.

1361
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:08,603
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

1362
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:11,604
Every time I pushed you,
l... l threatened you,

1363
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,967
I yelled at you, I pushed you
beyond your limits,

1364
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:16,208
it was because I believe in you!

1365
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,248
I believe in each one of you!

1366
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:21,290
I believe in your spirit
and your intelligence

1367
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:22,890
and your potential.

1368
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,441
And every time I talked
about walking away,

1369
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,727
it was because I was scared!

1370
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,365
I just didn't think I was good enough

1371
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:30,680
to stand next to you

1372
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,883
and call you brothers and say to you

1373
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,644
I love you!

1374
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:38,647
I love you guys so much!

1375
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:40,801
Raph?

1376
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:43,371
We made it.

1377
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:45,725
Are you crying?

1378
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:52,771
No, ding-dong.
It's just a little dusty out here.

1379
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:21,882
Okay, the mutagen is now
entering his bloodstream.

1380
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:23,841
Master Splinter?

1381
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,001
Nothing's happening.

1382
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:27,004
Why isn't it working yet?

1383
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:31,930
Mikey...

1384
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,640
- Huh?
- Mikey, come closer.

1385
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:39,851
What did he say? What did he say?

1386
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:42,924
He said, "Please get
your knee off my chest."

1387
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:45,601
<i>Sensei!</i>

1388
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:47,521
You're alive!

1389
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,045
It worked!

1390
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:52,727
I'm sorry. This was all my fault.

1391
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:56,367
You were right. We weren't ready.

1392
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:57,885
No.

1393
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:02,887
It was I who wasn't ready to let you go.

1394
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:05,486
All you needed was to discover

1395
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:10,202
that your true power lies
in believing in one another.

1396
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,370
There she is.

1397
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,482
New York's secret weapon.

1398
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,050
How's your arm, Vern?

1399
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,403
Well, it wouldn't be much use in a fight.

1400
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:36,289
Not that I was much use before, but...

1401
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:38,922
- Did you get a new car?
- Yeah.

1402
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,887
You're looking
at the new Fenwick Express.

1403
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:43,121
Pretty sweet, huh?

1404
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:44,565
Kind of an upgrade.

1405
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:45,800
I figured I'd need new wheels

1406
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,569
after my old work vehicle went boom.

1407
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:49,245
Yeah, Channel 6 gave it to me.

1408
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:50,646
They said don't put a scratch on it,

1409
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:52,529
but, like, lightning's going
to strike twice?

1410
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:55,166
So, is that why you called me here,

1411
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:57,487
to talk about your new car?

1412
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:59,290
I know that you're not exactly

1413
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,681
a fancy restaurant
kind of girl, so I figured

1414
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:04,001
a creepy underpass
in an abandoned neighborhood

1415
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:05,326
in the middle of the night
was more your speed.

1416
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,444
I wanted you to be comfortable.

1417
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:15,171
DJ Mikey in the house!

1418
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:20,328
What are you guys doing here?

1419
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:24,206
We figured we owed you a
thanks for keeping our secret.

1420
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:29,489
You had a lot to gain
from telling people about us,

1421
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:30,800
but you had our backs.

1422
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:34,210
Yeah, 'cause that's what
family's for, Raph.

1423
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:38,490
So you guys are driving now?

1424
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,403
Yeah, man. I pimped this bad boy out.

1425
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:44,451
Got a 42-inch plasma with the
NBA package, shave ice machine,

1426
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,648
7.1 digital surround sound.

1427
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,802
Check the bass, bra.

1428
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:53,366
Uh-oh.

1429
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:11,605
Ooh.

1430
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:17,530
My bad. I'm still figuring out the buttons.

1431
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:19,847
That was my new Fenwick Express!

1432
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:22,207
I just... I just got that.

1433
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:25,364
We better get out of here.
Want a ride home?

1434
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,401
You know what?
I think we're gonna take the subway.

1435
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,801
We're going to take the subway.

1436
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:33,805
You sure?

1437
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,769
I got a real nice song that's all cued up.

1438
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:37,520
- It's special, girl.
- No, don't.

1439
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,000
- For us.
- Come on, Mikey.

1440
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:40,850
No, no, no,
Mikey, you promised.

1441
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:42,080
It's happening.

1442
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:45,045
<i>Imagine me and you
I do</i>

1443

1444
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,725

1445
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,610
I'm making
really good headway!

1446
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:54,364
Shut up, Mikey!

1447
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:02,082
