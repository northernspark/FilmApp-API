24 hours?

131
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,315
Ned?

132
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:37,088
I'm looking for my dad.
He hasn't come home.

133
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,090
Neither has my wife.

134
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:41,626

136
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:47,365

Hey.

142
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:11,622
We haven't got the chance
to tell you.

143
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:17,728

She was a good one.

144
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:51,462

Annabelle.

147
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,564
I don't mean to be
insensitive...

148
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:37,501
But I was kind of hoping you
could answer a question for me.

149
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:41,706
Your mother underwent a
kidney transplant at St. Luke's.

150
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,275
Your father is listed
as the donor.

151
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:47,345
Her body rejected the
transplant.

152
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:49,814
See, what I'm trying
to understand is...

153
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:51,949
There must have been some
kind of mistake.

154
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,585
The x-rays--

155
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,922
your father has two perfectly
functioning kidneys
of his own.

00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:45,963
<i> And with no sign of the U.S.</i>

160
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:49,834
In the hospital, you kept
calling her...

161
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:52,703
Talking to her like
she was right there.

163

<i>that's going on.</i>

164
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:06,584
I know it's been tough,
but we're only going to make it
if we work at this together.

165
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:10,788
Okay?

166
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,625
Yeah.

167
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,130

<i> And we have word</i>

David.

Jane?

180
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,484
I miss you.

181
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:48,752
I know.

182
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,755
What's happening to me?

183
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,562
You remember the night
i told you I was pregnant?

184
00:24:58,564 --> 00:25:03,501
You said you didn't want to
bring a child into this place...

185
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:08,906
But as long as we were together
there was always hope.

186
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,615
You have to create it.

187
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:23,787
<i> There isn't much time...</i>
<i> For Annie.</i>

188
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:28,125
<i>Commentator</i>
<i>the president has assured us</i>
<i>that the disarmament of Iran...</i>

189
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:32,296

<i>for generations to come...</i>

190
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:36,133
<i> But what we're dealing with</i>
<i> is the complete and utter...</i>

191
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:38,903
<i> Destabilization</i>
<i> of an entire region.</i>

192
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:44,708
<i> We've caused the displacement</i>
<i> of thousands of families into</i>
<i> refugee camps.</i>

193
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,979
<i> These families are suffering</i>
<i> from starvation due</i>
<i> to overcrowding.</i>

194
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:52,550
<i> The question we've got</i>

195
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:55,119
<i> When will the bloodshed</i>
<i> come to an end?</i>

196
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:22,279
I wasn't expecting you to
come all the way out here.

197
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:28,052
I came so you could explain to
me in person why, in the middle
of a war...

198
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,189
Are you still chasing
space rocks?

199
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:35,593
I'm sure you can understand
why we haven't been able
to leave.

200
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,027
The data is undeniable.

201
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,329
You were ordered to shut down.

202
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:41,732
I can't... not yet.
We're too close.

203
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:44,268
You were army intelligence
before you joined us...

204
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:50,374
Four years in Pakistan, yet you
chose an assignment completely
unbefitting your skill set.

205
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,211
I felt I could make a
difference this time.

206
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:58,916
This war needs men like you
on the front line.

207
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:02,620
Men with scars like yours,
win wars.

208
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:07,391
What we are about to find here,
it could change everything.

209
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:09,393
You wouldn't need war.

210
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:14,999
The country is dying.
People are starving.

211
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:20,037
Desperate for opportunity...
Hope.

212
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:25,142
War gives them a reason...
Purpose.

213
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,177
Now, we don't need to end
this war, not yet.

214
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:33,684
But as is the case with any
conflict, we do need a strategic
advantage.

215
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:39,990
Although the specimen we have
hasn't survived...

216
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,393
But there may be a living sample
somewhere.

217
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:45,229
It seems to require
temperate climates.

218
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:48,432
It's unsustainable above 80
degrees.

219
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:51,335
What's the status of our
patient?

220
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:57,241
Dr. Wilkins advises that
Mr. Gutierrez may not
survive the procedure.

221
00:27:57,243 --> 00:28:02,780
We're at 23 casualties
a day in Iran... 23.

222
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,692
Open him up.

223
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:16,927
I want to know everything
about it.

224
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,999
Hey. What are we telling
the wife?

225
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:25,202
You can tell her that
Mr. Gutierrez suffered
cardiac arrest...

226
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:29,173
In the attempt to
save him from a lethal virus.

227
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:32,976
That his sacrifice has spared
the country from a deadly
epidemic.

228
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:24,928
<i> David</i>
<i> oh, messy, messy face.</i>

229
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,034
<i> Okay... silly me.</i>

230
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:33,203
<i> Now push her on the swing.</i>

231
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:34,872
<i> Look out.</i>

232
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:38,108
<i> Whoo! Daddy will catch you.</i>
<i>Touching the camera.</i>

233
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,410
<i> There we go. I'm gonna</i>
<i> tickle your feet.</i>

234
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:47,217
<i> Okay. Want me to push</i>
<i> you on the swing?</i>

235
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:50,821
<i> Oh, you're a good girl...</i>
<i> Good girl.</i>

236
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,157
<i> Hi, daddy.</i>

237
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,792
<i> Look at the camera.</i>

238
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:55,993
<i> I want a round.</i>

239
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:02,065
What are you doing?

240
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:08,839
Writing a letter
to general corazon.

241
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:11,475
What for?

242
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:14,144
The age of advanced
technological warfare...

243
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:17,281
And we're sending draftees
to die in the desert.

244
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:19,550
And here I am unemployed
and impotent.

245
00:30:19,552 --> 00:30:22,486
Fuck draftees.
I can still hold a gun.

246
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:24,354
Yeah?

247
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,493
I'd rather starve
to death here.

248
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:37,167
Beats the pity stares and
those 11:00am support groups.

249
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,403
Nothing worse than being
surrounded by a bunch of guys...

250
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:41,438
Claiming that the silver lining
of the colostomy bag...

251
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,074
Is that you don't have to wait
to the commercial to piss.

252
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:47,211
You don't want to go back.

253
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:50,447
See pain, I can deal
with that.

254
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:54,017
It's the inactivity that sucks.

255
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:58,155
World's going to hell anyway.
We're just reaping what
we've sown.

256
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:07,497
Hey, you know what
acrotomophilia is, right?

257
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,500
Anima-- what?

258
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:13,537
It's perverts getting
turned on by stumps.

259
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:16,073
No joke.
Why would you bring that up?

260
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:18,475
You got one on your six.

261
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,886
Give me a second.

262
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,590
I get ten percent.

263
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,526
What do you want?

264
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:39,963
Still looking for a job?

265
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,944
Run the winch.

266
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,215
What are we haulin'?

267
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,182
Bring it up!

268
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,597
What the hell is that?

269
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,234
Help me here.

270
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,253
Come on.

271
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,561
Get in.

272
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,595
<i> Commentator</i>
<i> what we're seeing now</i>
<i> are the arrival...</i>

273
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:54,531
<i> Of half a dozen Chinese and</i>
<i> Russian warships into the</i>
<i> persian Gulf...</i>

274
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:58,301
<i>What the president is calling a</i>
<i>futile show of intimidation...</i>

275
00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:01,772
<i> Against the coalition forces</i>
<i> currently occupying Iran.</i>

276
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,475
What's this?

277
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,813
I'm putting half
in the barn.

278
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:11,515
The other half is going
to goodwill.

279
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,385
Fresh start for both of us,
right?

280
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,090
This your mom's stuff?

281
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:23,226
Yeah, well, you haven't been
around much...

282
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:27,564
So I figure that this place
could use a little bit
of a spring clean.

283
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,202
This is one of her favorites.

284
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:46,416
That ski-hike... we did
in Vermont that winter...

285
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:49,619
And the blizzard rolled
in right over the top of us.

286
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:04,301
You were so scared, but your
mom held you so tight.

287
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:06,369
You remember what she said?

288
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,376
Nothing bad will ever last.

289
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:26,289
You don't need to pretend she
was never here to move on.

290
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,542
You're due for an upgrade, man.

291
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:21,411
Christ, Zach,
this one works fine.

292
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:25,348
Ooh!
What's the matter?

293
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,384
You all right?

294
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:33,823
Yeah. Leg's playing up.

295
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:39,262
Phantoms... I get 'em
all the time.

296
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:41,965
It's different if you see
your limbs come off.

297
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:43,567
You get closure.

298
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,638
How much did that perv pay you?

299
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,874
$40.
That all?

300
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,776
Well, it's something.

301
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:56,546
One minute it's a job, next he's
got his cock in your mouth.

302
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,749
Makes sense to me.
What else are we good for?

303
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:02,586
They think you'll charge half
the price for just one knee pad?

304
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:05,422
Why don't you put that
in your letter? Hm?

305
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:07,424
What's that supposed to mean?

306
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,661
Okay. You ready to do this?

307
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:16,233
For all the good it's gonna do.

308
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:19,970
We don't want your fascist war!
We don't need your draft no
more!

309
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,575
We don't we want
your fascist war!

310
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,677
We don't we need your draft
no more!

311
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,356
All right, all right, come on,
people. Let's wrap this up.

312
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:41,024
We don't we want
your fascist war!

313
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:42,959
We don't we need--
what the--

314
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,333
come on.

315
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:54,337
Hey, sir? Hey, you look
like a smart guy.

316
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:56,840
Sign this and you won't
have to worry about your kids
getting blown up.

317
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:58,642
How 'bout it?

318
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:03,446
Traitor.

319
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:07,050
Say it again! Say it again!
Hey! Hey!

320
00:38:07,052 --> 00:38:10,954
Say it again! I'll kill you!
Get off me!

321
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:14,658
That's it, people!
Enjoy the freak show! Huh?

322
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,796
Want to spend a night
in a jail cell?

323
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,813
Oh, Jesus, you got to get
that leg checked out, man.

324
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,316
Go.

325
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:40,684
Just go.

326
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:02,098
What the hell is that?

327
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,437
What the hell did
you do to me?

328
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:27,791
Dad?

329
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:29,092
Get some water.

330
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,729
Now, Annie!

331
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,801
Breathe, breathe.

332
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,971
He needs to go to the hospital.

333
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:43,506
No hospitals.

334
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:44,908
Are you crazy?
He'll bleed to death.

335
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,676
No, he won't.

336
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,847
It's healing him.

337
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:52,482
What is that?

338
00:40:52,484 --> 00:40:54,851
I need you to stay here
and watch him.

339
00:40:54,853 --> 00:40:57,787
Keep your eyes on him.
I'll be back.

340
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:14,103
So what's the plan?

341
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:19,576
Our movement orders came in.
We report to Philly at 0800.

342
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:22,912
I'm sorry to disappoint,
gentlemen, but we're not going
to Philadelphia.

343
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,247
What?

344
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:26,216
Give me three samples.
Now what do you mean?

345
00:41:26,218 --> 00:41:28,918
We just had another one land...
North-east.

346
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,020
But our intel is thin at best.

347
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:32,555
How do we explain this
to deputy ep--

348
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:34,958
deputy Epstein will
come around.

349
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,728
I'm sure he'll be grateful
for every dead soldier
we don't need to bury.

350
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:42,065
A blind man can see...
What the fuck else do you need?

351
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,134
We're going north-east.

352
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,840
Medic!

353
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,742
Hey.
Are you okay? Stay calm.

354
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:54,911
Just rest.
You're okay?

355
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:57,714
You're gonna start bleeding
again.

356
00:41:57,716 --> 00:42:00,917
It'll be okay.
Just rest. Okay?

357
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:07,023
It's okay. It'll be okay.

358
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,580
What the hell is going
on here?

359
00:42:30,582 --> 00:42:31,981
We need to move him.

360
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:34,851
Grab the door.
Grab the door!

361
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,826
Oh, hold him.

362
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,863
What is that?

363
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:48,965
It's dying from the heat.

364
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,045
We gotta get him closer.

365
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:03,880
Bring that over.

366
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,798
What's it doing?

367
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,233
You'll see. Just watch.

368
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,838
Hey... it's okay.

369
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,274
Look. See?

370
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:36,779
Hey.

371
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:55,331
It's okay... he'll be here.

372
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,157
Hey.

373
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:59,362
You okay?

374
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:01,431
It's real. I'm not dreaming.

375
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,869
I hope not.

376
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,841
What's it like?

377
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:19,082
Strange.

378
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:26,289
Where is he?

379
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:34,464
Dad?

380
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,202
You gotta see this.

381
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:54,450
What's it for?

382
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:57,086
Protection.

383
00:45:57,088 --> 00:46:01,124
Protection? From what?

384
00:46:01,126 --> 00:46:03,860
Something we can't prevent.

385
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:09,198
Look, I know it sounds crazy,
but you've seen what it can do.
You've felt it.

386
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:13,136
This-- this is a gift.

387
00:46:13,138 --> 00:46:17,907
You have no idea what this
thing is or what else it's
capable of.

388
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:21,277
You have to trust me
with this, Annie.

389
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:25,848
Everything'll be fine...
I promise.

390
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:28,151
We're gonna need a ton of steel.

391
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:36,425
Ramon 's got me on inventory.
Shit job, but who's complaining,
right?

392
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:40,062
Guy's got his hands in so many
pies, still bitches.

393
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:43,966
Half the shit I don't even ask
about. How you doing?

394
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,468
You know.

395
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,236
You should hook up with Mickey,
trade some stocks.

396
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:49,138
Yeah, that'd be great.

397
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,073
That old metal works, though,
that's where it's at.

398
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:53,009
Swear to god if I had the money,
I'd re-open it myself.

399
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:54,811
Come on, that place's nothing
but a graveyard.

400
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:56,579
Hey, you could be my foreman.

401
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:58,047
Thanks.

402
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:00,183
So this is the shit
you wanted?

403
00:47:00,185 --> 00:47:04,086
Yeah. I owe you.

404
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:08,024
How's Annie holding up?

405
00:47:08,026 --> 00:47:11,260
She's worried. Who wouldn't be?

406
00:47:11,262 --> 00:47:16,199
No, I mean since Jane.

407
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:18,467
I don't know. She's fine.

408
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:22,305
Maybe better than I am.

409
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:30,546
You know, I always wanted
to kill you.

410
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:34,083
Scoring the one girl on the
drill team that turned me down.

411
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:40,423
I was strong side linebacker.

412
00:47:40,425 --> 00:47:43,426
You always were a lucky son-
of-a-bitch though, huh?

413
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:48,998
Hey, thanks.

414
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:52,935
Hey, how old are you now?

415
00:47:52,937 --> 00:47:55,471
Keep dreaming.

416
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:59,175
Bottoms up.

417
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:11,087
We should go to a titty bar.
Yeah.

418
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:20,596
There you go.

419
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,407
Yep. Got em.

420
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,620
Come on, let's go.

421
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,368
This is it.

422
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:07,103
You sure?

423
00:50:07,105 --> 00:50:10,639
Yeah. No one's set foot
in here in years.

424
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:12,208
Let's bring in that
cement mixer.

425
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,268
Should I be concerned
about any of this business?

426
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:42,204
Oh, not at all, sheriff.
It's just protocol.

427
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,454
Appears to be stable.

428
00:50:58,456 --> 00:50:59,688
Where's the rest of it?

429
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:04,060
You're supposed to tell me.

430
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:07,463
Do you believe in
coincidences, agent stipe?

431
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:12,268
In my experience, there are
no coincidences, sheriff.

432
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:14,603
You might want to talk
to David Chamberlain.

433
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:18,741
Local guy, crashed his car
near here the other night.

434
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:23,846
Strangest thing, too.
Not a scratch on him.

435
00:51:23,848 --> 00:51:26,449
It's unprecedented.

436
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:28,651
At first we couldn't understand
what we were seeing.

437
00:51:28,653 --> 00:51:31,754
Fluorescence in-situ
hybridization identified
the presence...

438
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:34,323
Of hundreds of different alleles
for each gene.

439
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:39,095
But this genetic information
isn't organized into chromosomes
as we understand them.

440
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:46,435
So far, we've isolated multiple
sequences resembling various
plant and animal strands.

441
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:49,138
Some of these strands even
appear to be human.

442
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:53,309
What we're dealing with here
is a living sample
of a biogenesis.

443
00:51:53,311 --> 00:51:54,844
Evolution?

444
00:51:54,846 --> 00:52:00,182
No, no. This precedes
evolution. It's creation.

445
00:52:00,184 --> 00:52:02,751
Who'd have thought...
That's an amoeba.

446
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:07,890
I don't know what to do.

447
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:13,729
You always said that he'd
do things in his own way.

448
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:20,269
The fact is that without
you he--

449
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:30,679
he did his best
and... I hate him for it.

450
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:39,555
I don't want to hate him.

451
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:47,429
I never could quite understand
how you... kept loving him.

452
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:50,332
No matter how many times
he let you down.

453
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,638
I miss you so much, mom.

454
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:15,691
This'll work.

455
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:59,969
You're standing too close.

456
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,805
What?

457
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:04,873
Unless you're planning
on setting yourself alight.

458
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:07,409
You must be Annabelle.

459
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:12,581
Special agent Julius stipe...
National science agency.

460
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:16,585
We'd like to ask your father
some questions.

461
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:17,820
Is he here?

462
00:54:17,822 --> 00:54:19,488
No.

463
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:24,693
Oh, no need to be alarmed.
It's just protocol.

464
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:34,803
What do you want
with my father?

465
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:46,515
We're looking for something.

466
00:54:46,517 --> 00:54:48,784
We're hoping he might be
able to help us find it.

467
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:59,461
Got a little drunk
with the boys.

468
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,363
It was my birthday.

469
00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:04,033
I came home to celebrate
with my daughter.

470
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:10,406
I can't recall seeing anything
but a light in the sky...

471
00:55:10,408 --> 00:55:12,574
And that was when
i lost control.

472
00:55:12,576 --> 00:55:16,045
Not much more I remember
before I blacked out.

473
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:28,590
You ever been to the
air and space museum in D.C.,
Mr. Chamberlain?

474
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:33,362
No.

475
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:37,700
My mother used to drive me
there every summer.

476
00:55:37,702 --> 00:55:40,102
She'd let me wander
the place for hours.

477
00:55:40,104 --> 00:55:46,442
I learned so many things
about the universe and time
and space.

478
00:55:46,444 --> 00:55:49,411
It's really incredible
everything we've accomplished...

479
00:55:49,413 --> 00:55:54,550
But what's even more fascinating
is how little we actually know.

480
00:55:54,552 --> 00:55:58,120
I've always believed that
if we found real evidence...

481
00:55:58,122 --> 00:56:00,723
Of something greater
than ourselves...

482
00:56:00,725 --> 00:56:03,359
Something that inspired
the human race...

483
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:06,395
Then maybe the world
would have peace.

484
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:17,773
Now this thing you found,
it just might be the miracle
people are hoping for.

485
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:23,612
Can't say I believe
in miracles all that much.

486
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:33,155
You have a kidney in your
body that wasn't there
before, Mr. Chamberlain.

487
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:35,491
So, please don't lie to me.

488
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:50,105
The last person to come
in contact with an object
like the one you found...

489
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:58,180
He thought it had healed
him, too.

490
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:07,990
That's where I kept it.

491
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:13,495
Wasn't long before I noticed
it didn't react well to the
humidity in here.

492
00:57:13,497 --> 00:57:17,466
Thing had just ... melted.

493
00:57:17,468 --> 00:57:19,568
Melted?

494
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,907
Things been tough,
Mr. Chamberlain?

495
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:27,176
Huh?

496
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:34,082
Since the death of your wife.

497
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:35,984
Must have been very hard
for you...

498
00:57:35,986 --> 00:57:40,456
Knowing there was nothing
you could do to save her.

499
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,092
Yeah.

500
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,597
Sorry I can't be more
help to you.

501
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:52,868
No, you've been more
than helpful. Thank you.

502
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:13,188
Annie?

503
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:15,491
They know you have it.

504
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:17,926
They're gonna find it.
What then?

505
00:58:17,928 --> 00:58:20,195
They take you away?
Cut you open like that old man?

506
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:21,897
No, that won't happen.

507
00:58:21,899 --> 00:58:23,232
Those men were here,
in our house.

508
00:58:23,234 --> 00:58:27,035
It found me for a reason.
She found me.

509
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:28,937
Who? Who found you?

510
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:33,208
Your mom, Annie. She showed me
something's gonna happen.

511
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:39,214
No. This-- this thing is messing
with your head, changing you.

512
00:58:39,216 --> 00:58:41,550
Can't you see that?
No, you're wrong!

513
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:44,853
She's gone, dad.

514
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:47,756
You didn't want to see it
when she was lying in that
hospital bed all alone...

515
00:58:47,758 --> 00:58:49,591
But she's gone and you
can't bring her back.

516
00:58:49,593 --> 00:58:53,128
No! No.

517
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:56,832
I won't let them
take it away.

518
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:59,134
You know what it showed me?

519
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:03,105
It showed me everything
i wanted to forget.

520
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:10,946
Just before she died,
she asked me where you were...

521
00:59:10,948 --> 00:59:12,781
When you were coming
to see her.

522
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:16,785
But you never came.

523
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:41,310
Annie?

524
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:44,740
Hey, Mickey, I need a favor.

525
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,367
He's driving in circles.

526
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:15,971
Bring him in.

527
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:45,067
How you doing? Nice suit.

528
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:52,441
We have a situation.

529
01:01:52,443 --> 01:01:53,842
You lost him.

530
01:01:53,844 --> 01:01:55,110
For now.

531
01:01:55,112 --> 01:01:57,112
The daughter.

532
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:04,052
<i>U.S. casualties have risen</i>
<i>well above 35 soldiers a day...</i>

533
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,722
<i> As the advancement</i>
<i> into Tehran continues.</i>

534
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:10,826
<i> Members of congress have met</i>
<i> to persuade the president</i>
<i> and general corazon...</i>

535
01:02:10,828 --> 01:02:13,295
<i>To halt any further movement...</i>
What the hell is that?

536
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:15,363
<i> In Iran until an agreement</i>
<i> can be reached...</i>
This isn't gonna end well.

537
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:17,866
<i> ...with Russia and China.</i>

538
01:02:17,868 --> 01:02:21,403
They'll shake hands,
exchange pleasantries...

539
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:24,339
Then go back to killing
children again.

540
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:27,442
Ramon , you okay?

541
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:35,383
Explain why some assholes
are moving my scrap.

542
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:41,990
And a truck that only you
have the keys to.
What?

543
01:02:41,992 --> 01:02:44,025
This some kind of inside job?

544
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:46,328
Inside job? I don't know
shit about this.

545
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:50,532
No? It sure looks like your
boy Chamberlain to me.

546
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:56,905
Dave.

547
01:02:56,907 --> 01:03:00,776
Don't fuck with me, cerillo.
Get my truck back.

548
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:44,152
Zach?

549
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:57,165
You okay?

550
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:02,504
Look at me.

551
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:48,016
Didn't know where else
to go.

552
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:55,257
She was sick.

553
01:04:55,259 --> 01:04:57,659
He did everything he could.

554
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:04,532
Gave her a part of himself...

555
01:05:04,534 --> 01:05:08,203
But she kept getting worse.

556
01:05:08,205 --> 01:05:11,907
All he did was work.

557
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:19,214
Trying to pay for treatments
we couldn't afford.

558
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:26,288
I know he thinks
he's doing this for me...

559
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:29,190
But I can't be the reason.

560
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:35,397
They'll kill for it.

561
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:38,600
I won't let that happen.

562
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:40,168
Okay?

563
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:44,239
I'll take you to your dad...

564
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:48,510
But first... I want you
to meet someone.

565
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:56,017
Jim.

566
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:01,323
I brought a friend.

567
01:06:01,325 --> 01:06:03,358
This is Annabelle.

568
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:09,164
You know the t-bones they're
serving here are shipped
in from China?

569
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:15,236
You believe that?

570
01:06:15,238 --> 01:06:19,007
Where the hell is all our
meat, if we gotta eat cows
from China?

571
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:26,414
Hey.

572
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:30,151
I've found a way
to make things better.

573
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:32,620
The way it was before.

574
01:06:32,622 --> 01:06:36,324
I don't need another one
of your goddamned arms or legs,
Zach. I got nowhere to go.

575
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:39,594
Hey, listen. Listen to me.
Hey!

576
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:52,640
It's healed. It's healed.

577
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:59,280
That's a nice trick.

578
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:04,119
Come with me.

579
01:07:04,121 --> 01:07:07,489
I can make you better.

580
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:14,629
Maybe another time.

581
01:07:14,631 --> 01:07:16,531
Celtics are playing
the bulls tonight.

582
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:19,734
Not many games left.

583
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:24,372
Who knows if there'll even
be another season, right?

584
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:34,816
I'm coming back and I'm
gonna get you out of here.

585
01:07:34,818 --> 01:07:36,818
Okay?

586
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,612
Let's go for a ride, corporal.

587
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:11,152
Don't be a hero.

588
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:00,735
Tony?

589
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:04,873
We used to play in here.

590
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:08,309
You stole Ramon 's truck.
For this?

591
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:09,878
What the fuck is this?

592
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:12,347
You couldn't begin
to understand.
Understand?

593
01:09:12,349 --> 01:09:14,449
After all I've done for you?

594
01:09:14,451 --> 01:09:16,851
This is the only way.
This thing is bigger than you.

595
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:19,787
Bullshit!

596
01:09:19,789 --> 01:09:21,689
I got responsibilities.

597
01:09:21,691 --> 01:09:23,591
Dave, I'm not going down
for you.
You won't go down.

598
01:09:23,593 --> 01:09:26,561
I'm not going down
for you or no one.
I'm telling you.

599
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,398
Yeah, police.

600
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:37,839
Shit!

601
01:09:46,615 --> 01:09:48,449
Tony?

602
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:07,835
Dave?

603
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:14,335
How long since we last
did this?

604
01:11:14,337 --> 01:11:18,640
Thanksgiving... two years ago.

605
01:11:18,642 --> 01:11:21,042
That was the last time
i could move like this.

606
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:29,384
You're so beautiful.

607
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,288
Where is she, David?

608
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:35,990
She doesn't trust me.
She wants to.

609
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:38,293
No.

610
01:11:38,295 --> 01:11:44,299
No, I've done a terrible thing.
I don't deserve this.

611
01:11:44,301 --> 01:11:48,903
I know. It was never
meant for you.

612
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:53,841
You have to find them.

613
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:55,910
You're out of time.

614
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,687
<i> This has now been confirmed.</i>

615
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:10,692
<i>Bagram airbase, the U.S.</i>
<i>military's primary staging</i>
<i>point for operation terminus...</i>

616
01:12:10,694 --> 01:12:14,962
<i> Has been attacked by a long</i>
<i> range wmd of Russian origin.</i>

617
01:12:14,964 --> 01:12:19,434
<i> We have unconfirmed reports</i>
<i> this was in fact a nuclear</i>
<i> missile.</i>

618
01:12:19,436 --> 01:12:24,405
<i>The search for survivors has</i>
<i>been impeded by the danger and</i>
<i>instability of the site.</i>

619
01:12:24,407 --> 01:12:28,609
Says here you were
wounded in combat.

620
01:12:28,611 --> 01:12:30,812
Left leg amputated below
the knee.

621
01:12:30,814 --> 01:12:34,782
<i>In the Pentagon report that we</i>
<i>are now at defcon 1...</i>

622
01:12:34,784 --> 01:12:38,019
<i>Meaning the nuclear retaliation</i>
<i>against Russia--</i>

623
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:41,122
well, by the looks of it,
things have taken quite
a turn for you.

624
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:48,096
Think of the good we could
achieve, corporal.

625
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:53,668
Field casualties would drop
exponentially.

626
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:58,873
We could actually have a
chance at ending this war.

627
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,876
Don't you see that?

628
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:20,828
You need to tell me
where it is, Annabelle.

629
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:28,002
Wherever he's taken it,
you can be sure it's far
from here.

630
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:31,406
Touching.

631
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:14,715
Stop!

632
01:14:14,717 --> 01:14:17,652
Tell me where it is!

633
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:32,467
I gave you a chance...
On your knees.

634
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:58,893
We got something by the barn.

635
01:14:58,895 --> 01:15:01,028
He's here.

636
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:02,129
Get him.

637
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:11,939
Look around back. Go.

638
01:15:22,919 --> 01:15:25,820
Mr. Chamberlain.

639
01:15:25,822 --> 01:15:27,989
We have to go, Annie.

640
01:15:27,991 --> 01:15:29,891
We're not leaving him here.

641
01:15:29,893 --> 01:15:31,826
The key.

642
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:46,240
Turn around.

643
01:15:46,242 --> 01:15:48,109
Slowly!

644
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,984
What now?

645
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,898
Can you walk?
Yeah.

646
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:15,269
Come on, Annie. We've got
to get out of here.

647
01:16:15,271 --> 01:16:17,004
Come on.

648
01:16:28,984 --> 01:16:31,052
Get the rifle.

649
01:16:31,054 --> 01:16:32,820
Give me the gun.

650
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:53,874
Annie!

651
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:59,380
Come on, let's go!

652
01:17:14,197 --> 01:17:19,934
Stay-- stay with me. Stay, stay.
It's okay. It's okay, Annie.

653
01:17:19,936 --> 01:17:21,869
Okay, dad.

654
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:25,339
It's okay.

655
01:17:25,341 --> 01:17:27,174
Come on!

656
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:35,016
All right... they're headed
across town.

657
01:17:35,018 --> 01:17:37,818
This isn't right.

658
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:41,956
We're on the brink
of nuclear war.

659
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:44,125
I need you to understand that.

660
01:17:44,127 --> 01:17:48,329
Maybe this thing wasn't
sent to win wars.

661
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:50,798
Just drive.

662
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:55,369
You hear me?
Just fucking drive.

663
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:03,811
She needs you.
She's waiting for you.

664
01:18:07,149 --> 01:18:09,450
Baby, I did this for you.

665
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:55,996
Come on.

666
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:02,236
Please, please. Please!

667
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:03,771
Fuck!

668
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:32,867
They're here.

669
01:19:32,869 --> 01:19:34,902
Sorry, baby.

670
01:19:57,826 --> 01:19:59,460
She's gone.

671
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,901
David, what are you doing?
Put it down.

672
01:20:06,903 --> 01:20:08,369
You're gonna get us killed.

673
01:20:24,085 --> 01:20:26,220
David, stop.

674
01:20:30,892 --> 01:20:33,093
You don't want to do
anything stupid.

675
01:20:36,298 --> 01:20:38,132
I need you to put that out.

676
01:20:38,134 --> 01:20:40,000
No.

677
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:43,003
I have to destroy it.

678
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:52,513
Put it out now.

679
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:55,382
Dad?

680
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:05,893
Dad!
Wait! Stop!

681
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:19,974
Crap!

682
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,654
I won't let you do this.

683
01:21:33,656 --> 01:21:35,923
You stupid fuck.

684
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:13,327
Dad. Come on, dad.

685
01:22:13,329 --> 01:22:15,362
Stay inside. Annie!

686
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:29,710
I need you to look
after her for me.

687
01:22:29,712 --> 01:22:32,713
Can you do that?

688
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:36,216
Get inside, Zach.

689
01:22:36,218 --> 01:22:37,618
Get inside!

690
01:22:55,403 --> 01:22:57,204
Dad.

691
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:09,149
I'm sorry, Annie.
I'm sorry.

692
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:11,485
I can't go.

693
01:23:13,054 --> 01:23:15,122
Go where, dad?

694
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:19,059
I love you.

695
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:22,529
Dad!

696
01:23:22,531 --> 01:23:24,264
Dad!

697
01:23:24,266 --> 01:23:27,234
Annie, it's okay... it's okay.

698
01:23:27,236 --> 01:23:29,636
It's okay. It's okay.

699
01:23:32,641 --> 01:23:34,675
What is that?

700
01:23:38,747 --> 01:23:42,082
David, look at me.

701
01:23:42,084 --> 01:23:44,051
Open it.

702
01:23:44,053 --> 01:23:48,288
I can't... I can't open it.

703
01:24:18,686 --> 01:24:21,255
Annie. It's okay.

704
01:24:23,425 --> 01:24:25,359
Come home, David.

705
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:29,296
Come home.

706
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:51,672
<i> My mother once told me...</i>
<i> Nothing bad will ever last.</i>

707
01:26:52,305 --> 01:26:58,473
