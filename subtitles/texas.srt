2
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:01,325
Quiet, folks.

3
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:06,443
I hereby christen you Windy Miller.
Look out for your eyes.

4
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:13,359
- AI, where is Windy?
- I haven't seen him since last night.

5
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:14,482
Anybody here seen him?

6
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,125
- No!
- Look out!

7
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:18,763
Put it up over the lights.

8
00:02:23,647 --> 00:02:25,763
- Little previous, ain't you, Jim?
- It won't be long, brother.

9
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:30,521
You did?

10
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,763
- You got anything to say, Bud?
- Sure, I'm guilty, Judge.

11
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:41,760
I've been away so long from towns and
people, I just didn't know what I was doing.

12
00:02:41,847 --> 00:02:43,963
I was with Sherman down in Georgia.

13
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:51,282
- How long's this fella been in jail?
- Since this morning, Your Honour.

14
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:54,916
- What time this morning?
- 3:00, I reckon.

15
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:56,196
3:00?

16
00:02:58,647 --> 00:02:59,841
2:30.

17
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:08,518
I sentence you to 11 and a half hours in jail.

18
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:11,681
Sentence to set back to 3:00 this morning.

19
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:14,765
- Now hightail it out of here.
- Thank you, Judge.

20
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:17,840
What's next?

21
00:03:18,127 --> 00:03:19,685
Dan Thomas...

22
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:22,524
and Tod Ramsey.

23
00:03:22,847 --> 00:03:24,678
You boys get up there.

24
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:34,399
You're charged with trespassing
on private property...

25
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:36,644
of farmer O. V. Martin.

26
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:40,556
And of stealing a hog, which was recovered
at the point of a musket.

27
00:03:40,647 --> 00:03:44,560
Don't you Johnny Rebs know
it's against the law to go stealing of?

28
00:03:44,687 --> 00:03:47,918
It wasn't against the law
for Sherman down in Georgia.

29
00:03:48,087 --> 00:03:50,920
- What he means...
- I know what he means.

30
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:55,603
- How do you plead? Guilty or not guilty?
- Not guilty.

31
00:03:56,047 --> 00:03:58,038
- What's that?
- Not guilty.

32
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:01,515
Why, Constable, you said the farmer
caught them red-handed.

33
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:03,325
He sure did, Your Honour.

34
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:05,363
We took the pig, Judge...

35
00:04:05,447 --> 00:04:08,007
but we're not thieves. We were hungry.

36
00:04:08,087 --> 00:04:10,123
We hadn't eaten for several days...

37
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:12,767
and we got kind of tired
of people closing doors on our faces...

38
00:04:12,847 --> 00:04:15,315
just because we have
the wrong kind of uniform on.

39
00:04:15,407 --> 00:04:18,479
Have you got anything to say
before sentence is pronounced?

40
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:21,883
We only came up to work on the railroad,
and we found that finished.

41
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:23,764
We're on our way to Texas.

42
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:28,238
Texas? It's a mighty good place
for the likes of you two.

43
00:04:33,127 --> 00:04:37,962
You, Lee, and Beauregard,
and the rest of that rebel riffraff...

44
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:39,879
can get together down there...

45
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:43,277
and maybe you can start
another secession movement.

46
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:44,920
You dirty Yankee!

47
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:46,156
Danny, wait a minute.

48
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:48,681
You can't do that in this court.
What's the matter with you?

49
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,836
Order.

50
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:53,000
Order in the court.

51
00:04:53,207 --> 00:04:55,562
You young whippersnappers.

52
00:04:56,367 --> 00:05:00,724
I find you both guilty.
I'm gonna fine you $50 apiece.

53
00:05:00,807 --> 00:05:04,686
And as for you,
I'm gonna make an example out of you.

54
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:07,235
I'm gonna hold you for contempt of court...

55
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:09,358
and fine you another $50.

56
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:12,365
We haven't got $50,
let alone him having $100.

57
00:05:12,447 --> 00:05:14,802
Take them away. Next case.

58
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:16,362
Bats Delaney.

59
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:17,926
Take your hands off them.

60
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:20,282
Here's the fine for both of them.

61
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:25,765
That's a little bit irregular, Mr. Miller.

62
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,758
Everything's irregular
in this two-by-four court.

63
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:30,441
Including your remark
about Lee and Beauregard.

64
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:33,679
There's $20 for the fine of Bats Delaney.
Come on, Bats.

65
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:37,077
- He ain't entered his plea.
- He pleads guilty.

66
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:40,723
That's $20, and the fine's only $10.

67
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:44,322
Take the change and get some of the stink
out of this place.

68
00:05:44,407 --> 00:05:45,681
Come on.

69
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,005
Court's dismissed.

70
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:50,601
Come on.

71
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:53,201
- Mr. Miller?
- What do you want?

72
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:56,156
- We'd just like to thank you.
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

73
00:05:56,247 --> 00:05:58,158
Don't give it a thought.

74
00:05:58,247 --> 00:06:00,283
What outfit you boys with in the war?

75
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:02,835
Jeb Stuart's cavalry,
army of Northern Virginia.

76
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:03,916
I might've known it.

77
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:07,363
Nobody but a Virginian or a Texican
would jump a judge in his own court.

78
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:09,757
We'd like to work that money off,
if you'd let us.

79
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:11,923
Ain't often a stranger will
do you a favour like that.

80
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:14,681
I ain't no stranger
where a Johnny Reb is concerned.

81
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:16,519
I'm a Texican myself.

82
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,924
You boys still hungry?

83
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:22,520
I got the same appetite
I brought to town with me three days ago.

84
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:24,797
Bats, take them down
to Camp 18 and feed them.

85
00:06:24,887 --> 00:06:26,366
And keep your nose out of that jug.

86
00:06:26,527 --> 00:06:27,801
You boys look me up at the fight tonight.

87
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,482
Come on, I gotta get rid
of them high-collar dudes from Chicago.

88
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:34,557
Who is that one-man cyclone?

89
00:06:34,647 --> 00:06:36,603
You mean you ain't never heard
of Windy Miller?

90
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,599
No, we never did.
But from now on, we're for him.

91
00:06:39,687 --> 00:06:41,678
Where's that food he was talking about?

92
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:42,836
Come on.

93
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:43,239
<i>Oh, don't you remember</i>
<i>sweet Betsy from Pike</i>

94
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:47,357
<i>Oh, don't you remember</i>
<i>sweet Betsy from Pike</i>

95
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,318
<i>Who crossed o'er the mountain</i>
<i>with her lover lke</i>

96
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:55,108
<i>With two yoke of oxen,</i>
<i>a big yeller dog</i>

97
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,067
<i>A tall Shanghai rooster,</i>
<i>and one spotted hog</i>

98
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:03,152
<i>Oh, sing, goodbye Pike County</i>
<i>Farewell for a while</i>

99
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:07,869
<i>We'll come back again</i>
<i>when we've panned out our pile</i>

100
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,913
<i>They soon reached the desert,</i>
<i>where Betsy give out</i>

101
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:15,628
<i>While down in the sand</i>
<i>she lay rolling about</i>

102
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:23,352
Come on, let's have the fighters in here!

103
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,794
Quiet!

104
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:27,712
Ladies and gentlemen...

105
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:30,632
we beg your indulgence
for a few more minutes.

106
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:33,552
We can't start this fight
till Windy Miller gets here.

107
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,550
He's being detained at the hotel
on business.

108
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,674
What business?

109
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,910
The railroad's finished, ain't it?
Start that fight.

110
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,837
Get Windy here in a hurry.

111
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:44,796
- Get your fighters in the ring.
- All right.

112
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,358
Quiet, now.

113
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:49,112
The fighters will be right in the ring.

114
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,877
Get them out of here.

115
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:57,593
This is all right.
I think I'm gonna like this town.

116
00:07:57,679 --> 00:08:00,432
Yeah. Plenty going on here, huh?

117
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:23,268
Introducing the pride of Camp 19.

118
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,272
The best track layer west of the Mississippi:

119
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:27,553
Dutch Henry!

120
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,867
Hurray!

121
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,512
Boo!

122
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,747
Quiet.

123
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:45,469
Introducing the pride of Camp 18:

124
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,958
Matt Sawyer!

125
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,108
Boo!

126
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:00,912
- What's the matter with you?
- My leg, it's busted.

127
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,637
Somebody get a doctor.

128
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,550
Get a doctor, somebody.

129
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:09,599
A fine time you picked to be a high-jumper.

130
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:11,437
Get him out of here.

131
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:14,632
We got to have a fight.

132
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:17,187
There's Windy now. Come on.

133
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,113
Don't you worry, folks,
don't you worry for a minute.

134
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:23,509
We'll have a fight
if I have to take him on myself.

135
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:27,830
- Come here.
- Hey, big fella. I'll take you on.

136
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:37,628
- Excuse me. May I get through, please?
- Go on back and sit down.

137
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,671
- I'd like to get through to the ring.
- Go on back and sit down.

138
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,033
- Wait a minute.
- Just a minute.

139
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:44,633
You want to make something of it?

140
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,150
Hey, you Jeb Stuart boy!

141
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,397
Come over here.

142
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:03,588
How would you like
to pick up $200 in a hurry?

143
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,909
I'd even spend some time
to pick up that much money.

144
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:08,593
Start getting out of your clothes,
you're gonna fight Dutch Henry.

145
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:11,193
No. Wait a minute. I'm no fighter.

146
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:13,475
Win or lose, $200 in cash.

147
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,838
I'll do it for $50.

148
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:28,988
What?

149
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:30,558
We owe you the rest.

150
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,750
You've got a good memory.

151
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,075
- I'll bet it on you.
- Thanks.

152
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:38,032
- What's your name?
- Dan Thomas.

153
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,950
We'll tell them Texas Thomas. Get ready.

154
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,836
All right, get him ready.

155
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:44,558
You're crazy to do this.

156
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,107
Henry's a professional fighter.
He'll beat your ears down.

157
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:50,077
- We got $50 to take us to Texas, haven't we?
- Yeah.

158
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:52,110
- Hold on to it.
- All right.

159
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:54,508
I told you folks we were gonna have a fight.

160
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:57,750
Introducing the champion
of the Lone Star State:

161
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,512
Texas Thomas.

162
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:07,756
Do you think that this is another one
of Windy's tricks?

163
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:12,870
Work him around to this corner.
We'll take care of him.

164
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,671
This is going to be a decision fight, gents...

165
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:23,957
according to the London Prize Fight rules.

166
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:26,999
There'll be no biting in the clinches.

167
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,310
When a man goes down...

168
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:32,630
that ends the round.

169
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,832
If he can't come to the centre of the ring
and toe the mark inside of 30 seconds...

170
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,238
he loses.

171
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,149
- Are you ready, Texas?
- Yeah.

172
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:44,549
- Are you ready, Henry?
- Yep.

173
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,958
Let her rip.

174
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,754
Let me at him. Leave me at him.

175
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,750
What's going on here?

176
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,230
He grabbed Dan's foot.

177
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:34,475
You do that again
and I'll take you apart myself.

178
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,278
Get back there and let's get this fight going.

179
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:40,828
I'll bet you all thought it was real,
didn't you, folks?

180
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:44,548
Just a little entertainment I put on
between the rounds.

181
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,471
What did you let him see you for?

182
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,993
Round two coming up. Time.

183
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:56,473
Where's Tex? Where did he go?
Anybody see him?

184
00:12:57,439 --> 00:12:59,395
Windy, here he is.

185
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,393
Come on, get up here and fight.

186
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:07,589
I'm all right, Tod. Don't worry.

187
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:09,995
Good boy, Tex. Go get him.

188
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:35,115
Wait a minute, Danny.

189
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,068
Wait a minute, Danny. Come on.

190
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,674
Time!

191
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,239
More water. Some more water.

192
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,318
Round four. Time!

193
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:53,033
How long is he gonna keep getting up?

194
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,871
Round 10. Time!

195
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:24,274
Time!

196
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:38,834
- What round is it?
- Thirty-five.

197
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,955
Round 35. Time!

198
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:58,034
- I'm getting mighty tired of this.
- I don't blame you.

199
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:02,076
Are you all right, champ?

200
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,234
- Why don't they start the fight?
- Time!

201
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:14,275
Danny, are you all right?

202
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,915
Tex, do you want to quit?

203
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,313
- What happens to your bets if I quit?
- I win, of course.

204
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:53,508
You what?

205
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:56,830
You didn't really think I'd bet on you,
did you?

206
00:16:57,319 --> 00:16:59,958
Round 40. Time!

207
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:03,236
No, but I'm gonna make you wish you had.

208
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:22,317
Let him fall!

209
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:25,277
Let him fall!

210
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:54,512
Come on, Tod.

211
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:05,715
- I guess we lost them.
- Yeah.

212
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:08,194
- You feel all right?
- Yeah.

213
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:10,713
That $50 makes everything all right.

214
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:21,158
- Danny.
- Yeah?

215
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:26,315
- We haven't got that $50.
- What?

216
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,154
- I bet it on Dutch Henry.
- You what?

217
00:18:51,095 --> 00:18:54,531
You sure don't have to be told
what state this is.

218
00:18:55,215 --> 00:18:56,284
Too big.

219
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:03,608
Do you realise we've been riding a week
without seeing a single human being?

220
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:08,207
It's kind of quiet and peaceful, though,
after coming through that Indian country.

221
00:19:08,295 --> 00:19:11,367
Right now, I wouldn't even mind
seeing an Indian.

222
00:19:11,455 --> 00:19:14,208
You'd think people would hang out a sign.

223
00:19:15,935 --> 00:19:19,166
If we keep on going,
we're bound to hit something.

224
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:44,534
All right, everybody, out of that coach,
and keep your hands up.

225
00:19:57,015 --> 00:19:58,653
Looks like you could have picked
a shady spot.

226
00:19:58,735 --> 00:20:00,009
Shut up.

227
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:06,570
Which one of you fellows
is the cattle buyer from New Orleans?

228
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:11,247
Go through them.

229
00:20:21,535 --> 00:20:23,491
I wish you wouldn't take those.

230
00:20:23,575 --> 00:20:26,453
Went all the way to Kansas
to get them for Mrs. McLane.

231
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:29,254
- She needs them bad.
- Are you a dentist?

232
00:20:29,335 --> 00:20:31,690
You don't think them things
would fit a horse, do you?

233
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:34,335
- There's a point.
- Come on.

234
00:20:37,055 --> 00:20:39,330
That's real nice of you, brother.

235
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:43,085
It must be you.
Give me that $10,000 and quick.

236
00:20:45,935 --> 00:20:50,531
- How did you know I was the cattle buyer?
- Never mind that. Get back in that coach.

237
00:20:53,975 --> 00:20:56,205
- They're good at it, ain't they?
- Yeah.

238
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:15,327
Let's be moseying.

239
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:32,528
- You're always doing something like that.
- Is that so?

240
00:21:32,615 --> 00:21:36,403
I was holding up stagecoaches
before you got your diapers off.

241
00:21:36,655 --> 00:21:39,692
If I hadn't stopped you,
you'd still be arguing with that tooth-yanker.

242
00:21:39,775 --> 00:21:41,686
But a horse could wear false teeth.

243
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:43,686
I remember one time,
when I was way back in...

244
00:21:43,775 --> 00:21:46,687
I know you knew a horse in Tennessee
that wore a pair.

245
00:21:46,815 --> 00:21:48,009
Yes, I did.

246
00:21:49,815 --> 00:21:51,612
What did the boss want to meet us here for?

247
00:21:51,695 --> 00:21:54,289
You know as much about that as I do.

248
00:21:57,615 --> 00:22:00,732
Don't know what them Texans
fought so hard to get this state for.

249
00:22:00,815 --> 00:22:04,251
- Hardest ground in the world.
- Where's it any different?

250
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,764
In Cheatham County, Tennessee,
the ground is so soft...

251
00:22:07,855 --> 00:22:10,369
they use it to stuff mattresses with.

252
00:22:26,855 --> 00:22:28,573
What's the matter with him?

253
00:22:32,215 --> 00:22:35,810
All right, on your feet.
Get moving and keep those hands up.

254
00:22:35,895 --> 00:22:37,851
Get over there, you two.

255
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:43,612
- Who are you?
- Just a couple of strangers passing through.

256
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,889
All right, now, lie down.

257
00:22:44,975 --> 00:22:47,614
- Can't we make some arrangement?
- Not today. Get down there.

258
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:51,091
You ought to split with us.
That'd be the honest thing to do.

259
00:22:52,255 --> 00:22:55,372
- This ground is hard.
- All right, stampede their horses.

260
00:22:59,775 --> 00:23:03,370
- We'll meet again, someday.
- I hope you're carrying as much money.

261
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:18,390
I don't think there's a town
in the whole state of Texas.

262
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:21,876
Here we are with all this money
and nothing to spend it on.

263
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:25,315
The way you talk about that money,
you'd think it was really yours.

264
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:27,867
Listen, Tod, what's the sense of...

265
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,791
We can eat, anyway.

266
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:39,476
Get a fire going, I'll cut one of them out.
And hang on to this.

267
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:40,753
Right.

268
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:16,315
- Hello.
- Get them up, son.

269
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:22,797
- You're the sheriff?
- That's right.

270
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,358
Here's the holdup money.

271
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:27,272
- Sure it's the holdup money.
- Then you admit it?

272
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,554
- Where's the rest of your gang?
- We...

273
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:31,630
Wait a minute. I didn't hold up no stage.

274
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:33,630
You're gonna tell me
you waylaid the fellows who did.

275
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:35,550
- That's just what I did.
- Where's a tree?

276
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:38,068
- I was gonna return the money.
- I never saw the beat.

277
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,911
Every time I wanna hang a fella,
there's no tree.

278
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:43,116
- There's a big oak a mile back.
- You can't do that without a trial.

279
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:46,396
As Sheriff and justice of the peace,
you are guilty and will be hanged.

280
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:49,437
- Get on your horse.
- Just wait a minute.

281
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:51,271
Come on, get on your horse.

282
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:14,195
They say as how this tree was planted
40 years ago by Davy Crockett.

283
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,190
Why don't you wait
and ask the stage driver?

284
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:18,110
Son, I'm a court of law
and evidence is what counts.

285
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:20,349
You had the money, didn't you?

286
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,909
- Indians!
- Where?

287
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:27,398
Right behind me. Hundreds of them.

288
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:30,232
Here, boy. You're on your honour now.
Take for the hills, men.

289
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:32,150
Come on, boy, come on.

290
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:36,353
Ain't I the darndest liar? Come on.

291
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:46,670
Where are they going?

292
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,228
We've been hornswoggled. Get after them.

293
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,677
- We've got to separate.
- Separate?

294
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,876
It's our only chance.
I'll catch up with you some day.

295
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:37,994
Texas ain't that big.

296
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,876
You ain't much to look at,
but I'll sure miss you.

297
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:41,756
I ain't forgetting you, either.

298
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,797
- Good luck, fella.
- Take care of yourself, Danny.

299
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:12,510
All right, folks, step down.

300
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:16,633
What do you think you're doing?

301
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:19,552
Sorry, lady,
but I've got to take one of your horses.

302
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:21,277
You'll do no such thing.

303
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:24,237
- I'm telling you to get off.
- I will not.

304
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:30,958
You get off, or I'll take
both horses and the buckboard, too.

305
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,552
Now get off.

306
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,076
Will you help me down?

307
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:24,828
Stop!

308
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:44,187
Pull up.

309
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,318
- I can't stop here.
- Get out.

310
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:53,230
- Lady, there are some men after me.
- Get out.

311
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:55,389
If they get me,
they'll kill me for something I didn't do.

312
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:58,630
I could kill you for what you've done.
Get out.

313
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:25,033
The blankety-blank.

314
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:40,670
I've never seen a person do
so many things wrong in such a short time.

315
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:42,636
What I do is none of your business.

316
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:44,949
Just leave me alone.
I'm perfectly comfortable.

317
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:47,468
You're sitting in a lot of ants.

318
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:51,196
I like ants. Ouch!

319
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:54,787
Come here.

320
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:58,028
I can't unhook you
if you don't stop wiggling.

321
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,871
Hurry up. Let me go.

322
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,833
You can have your rig back now.

323
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:06,355
- I'll walk the rest of the way.
- I hope you break a leg.

324
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:10,238
Thanks for the lift.

325
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:12,708
- Don't mention it.
- One more thing.

326
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,278
You sure are pretty.

327
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:15,718
Giddyup!

328
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,508
Slim.

329
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:52,070
I'm sorry. I thought you were Slim.
Where did you come from?

330
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,512
I was right over there.

331
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:55,555
No, I mean, do you work around here?

332
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:56,833
Since when?

333
00:31:56,919 --> 00:31:58,511
- This afternoon.
- Fine.

334
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:01,711
You've got some dirt
right on your face, up right...

335
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:05,075
If you'd been bounced around on your ear
in the back of this thing...

336
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:08,117
as much as I have,
the least you'd have is a dirty face.

337
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:11,555
- How come you did that?
- It's a long story.

338
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,909
Unhitch these horses
and give them a good rubdown.

339
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:15,068
Yes, ma'am.

340
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,271
- Do you belong here?
- Yes, I'm Mike King.

341
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:22,792
That's a funny name for a girl. How did
you happen to get a nickname like that?

342
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:25,598
It's not a nickname. It's Michael.

343
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,677
Kind of a mean trick
to play on your parents, isn't it?

344
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:34,272
They expect a boy, and get his name
all picked out, and then you come along.

345
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:36,475
Yes, guess it was.

346
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:39,591
I almost forgot, when you're finished,
will you take an extra horse...

347
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,352
and go six miles out the Del Rio Pike
and pick up Hank?

348
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:46,518
- Yes, ma'am. Who's Hank? Your sister?
- No, he's the foreman.

349
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:49,996
- May I help you down, ma'am?
- Thanks.

350
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,910
- I'll see you later.
- Yes.

351
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:54,228
Listen, you,
that food's only free with your drink.

352
00:33:56,999 --> 00:34:00,036
- Do you understand English?
- No savvy.

353
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,829
- You broke?
- Yeah.

354
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,116
Why didn't you say so?

355
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:15,391
We got a right hospitable little town here.

356
00:34:15,759 --> 00:34:18,478
Never turn away anybody
that's hungry or thirsty.

357
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,396
If you're gonna eat free,
you might as well drink free.

358
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:25,551
Come on over
and have a drink on the house.

359
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:30,670
- Thanks.
- Don't give it a thought, brother.

360
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,072
Here you are.

361
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:45,950
Get out of here.

362
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:55,149
Hi, boys. Hot, ain't it?

363
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,107
Give me a beer.

364
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:00,994
Beer.

365
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:04,951
Never mind about that beer.
Get your hands up.

366
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:07,833
Indians, huh?

367
00:35:08,759 --> 00:35:12,115
Pretty smart, wasn't you? Who's smart now?

368
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:13,748
Listen, Sheriff...

369
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,353
No, you don't.
Come on out from behind that bar.

370
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:17,758
Get out from behind there.

371
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,592
- You're making an awful mistake.
- I ain't making any mistake.

372
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:22,192
Get his gun, Walt.

373
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:26,196
Keep him covered.

374
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,467
Ouch!

375
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:32,507
I told you, you made a mistake.

376
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:34,908
Son, you'd better be careful now.

377
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:37,388
- This won't do, you know.
- Come on, turn around.

378
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:40,039
Get back all of you. Get back.

379
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,754
Move.

380
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:47,071
- lf you like your sheriff, don't start anything.
- No, boys, don't start nothing.

381
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:50,912
- What's going on here?
- Out of the way, mister.

382
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:53,229
Don't argue with him.
It's my back he's got the gun into.

383
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:55,628
- Get out.
- He don't look dangerous. What'd he do?

384
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:56,913
Held up the southbound stage.

385
00:35:56,999 --> 00:35:58,227
Move out of that door.

386
00:35:58,319 --> 00:35:59,718
Wait a minute.

387
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:04,876
You got the wrong man, Sheriff.
If you got him.

388
00:36:05,759 --> 00:36:08,034
- We caught his partner with the money.
- You did?

389
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:10,394
And there were no
Christmas trees out there either.

390
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:14,309
That's funny. I was on that stage
and he wasn't one of them.

391
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:16,276
How could you tell? They was all masked.

392
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:18,668
A mask only hides your face.

393
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:22,434
It doesn't change your voice
or the way your bones is hung together.

394
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:26,435
And I'll swear he wasn't one of them.

395
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:29,352
- What about it?
- The Doc's word's good enough for me.

396
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:31,111
But it's sure kind of queer.

397
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:34,316
It's this heat.
You can't believe what you see.

398
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:38,150
Can I have the gun?

399
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:45,038
Stubborn cuss.

400
00:36:45,479 --> 00:36:47,834
Thanks, mister.
That was kind of a tough spot.

401
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:51,674
No sense in a man getting hung
for something he didn't do.

402
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:54,557
All this talking has made me kind of thirsty.

403
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:55,913
Come on.

404
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:01,677
Give me a bourbon.

405
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,672
- What'll you have?
- A cold glass of beer.

406
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:17,792
I guess it did look kind of bad to the sheriff
finding your partner with that money...

407
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:21,189
- after the stage was held up.
- I guess it did.

408
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:22,997
How'd you get it?

409
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:26,116
Me and my partner held up the bandits.

410
00:37:26,919 --> 00:37:29,194
Then, when I was out
running down some beef...

411
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:31,474
the sheriff held up my partner.

412
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:33,311
So, I held up the sheriff.

413
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:35,629
Sounds like you was playing
some kind of a game.

414
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:36,868
It does, doesn't it?

415
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:39,109
Doc, can I come up to see you
this afternoon?

416
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:42,111
- Any time.
- Thanks.

417
00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:47,149
Was you gonna return that money?

418
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:50,155
That was my partner's idea.

419
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:52,998
But you was going south with it, huh?

420
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:56,995
Sure I was,
till the sheriff took it away from us.

421
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:00,468
By George, I like an honest man.
What's your name?

422
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:04,472
- Dan Thomas. What's yours?
- Thorpe, Buford Thorpe. Call me Doc.

423
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:08,548
- You live around here?
- Nope.

424
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:13,072
- Got any relatives around here?
- Nope.

425
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:16,994
- Where you headed?
- No place.

426
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:20,475
What kind of work do you do?

427
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:23,551
I ain't particular. Anything that's a living.

428
00:38:23,799 --> 00:38:27,394
Wait a minute, open your mouth.
Come on, open it wider.

429
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,830
It never fails.

430
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:33,313
I can always tell the way a man's eyes look.

431
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:36,919
- Tell what?
- When he has a bad bicuspid.

432
00:38:36,999 --> 00:38:40,912
And that's as bad a bicuspid as I ever seen
in 30 years of dentistry.

433
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:45,996
Bet you've never felt a twinge of pain
from that molar yet, have you?

434
00:38:46,479 --> 00:38:48,390
- No.
- You see? That's how bad it is.

435
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:51,471
That's the kind of tooth
that falls apart all at once.

436
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:55,392
Come on up to the office
and I'll fix it for you.

437
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:58,391
- Put that on the book, Walt.
- All right, Doc.

438
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:00,397
You sure you know how?

439
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:02,629
Son, I'm the best dentist in this town...

440
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:05,870
and there's only two ways
to be the best dentist in a town.

441
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:09,429
- One of them is to do the finest work.
- What's the other?

442
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,157
To be the only dentist.

443
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,478
I guess it's kind of hard
for an ex-soldier to make a living.

444
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:20,870
Everybody treats them well
when the war is on...

445
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:24,349
but when the war is over,
they're sort of out of place.

446
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:28,477
Get pushed around from pillar to post.

447
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:38,632
That's bad for a young fella.
It makes him sort of bitter.

448
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:41,074
Makes him disgusted with conditions.

449
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:42,831
It sure does.

450
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,031
Gonna be a lot of activity in cattle
around here...

451
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:55,236
now that the railroad up in Abilene
is finished.

452
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,399
How did you know
the railroad was finished?

453
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,678
Ain't it?

454
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:09,910
Seems to me I read somewhere
where they was gonna finish it this month.

455
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:13,909
Ain't they done with it yet?

456
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:17,588
I don't know, I was just asking.

457
00:40:22,999 --> 00:40:24,512
That drill hurt?

458
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:27,068
I've had things done that felt better.

459
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,592
What'd you say?

460
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:33,991
I said, "I've had things done that felt better."

461
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,551
The dang drill's kind of dull.
Guess I'll have to get some new ones.

462
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,798
There you are.

463
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:50,713
There's a chance for a man
to make a lot of money down here...

464
00:40:50,799 --> 00:40:53,359
if he can just get his beef up there.

465
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:57,429
- Is that so hard?
- It seems to be.

466
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:13,356
There you are, just bite your teeth together
and kind of grind them.

467
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,231
Spit the pieces out.

468
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:20,590
Rinse your mouth out.

469
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:35,512
Looks like I might be able to get a job.

470
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,228
You might at that, if you hit the right place.

471
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:42,833
Come in.

472
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:45,154
Hello, Matt.

473
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:49,755
- You want me to come back later, Doc?
- No, we're all through. Come on in.

474
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:54,279
Son, shake hands with Matt Lashan.

475
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:56,676
He's got as many cows
as the next man, I guess.

476
00:41:56,759 --> 00:41:57,828
Glad to know you.

477
00:41:57,919 --> 00:41:59,910
This is Dan Thomas.
Him and his partner is the ones...

478
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:03,275
that held up them stagecoach bandits
and recovered all that money.

479
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,470
That was a mighty fine piece of work.

480
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:08,198
This boy's full of fire and vinegar, Matt.

481
00:42:08,279 --> 00:42:12,909
Only thing is, he's had a little trouble
finding a job and he's sort of disgusted.

482
00:42:12,999 --> 00:42:16,275
Seems like there ought to be
something around here he could do.

483
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:18,429
You're gonna be needing more men,
ain't you...

484
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:21,033
now that all them cattle's
going up to Abilene?

485
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,587
- Why don't you put him on?
- I might at that.

486
00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:27,069
Once the Doc gets through gnawing on me,
we'll talk it over.

487
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:28,228
Thanks.

488
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:29,911
Just wait in there.

489
00:42:29,999 --> 00:42:31,796
Get in the chair here, Matt.

490
00:42:31,879 --> 00:42:35,076
Doc, I meant to tell you.
I'll have to work this out.

491
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:36,837
I don't have any money.

492
00:42:36,919 --> 00:42:40,548
It's only a dollar.
Pay me out of your first month's wages.

493
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:43,349
How's them sore teeth treating you?

494
00:42:43,439 --> 00:42:46,112
Doc, this one on the right...

495
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:08,589
Tennessee, will you learn a new tune?

496
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:11,398
I been listening to that same thing forever
and I'm tired of it.

497
00:43:11,479 --> 00:43:14,994
A steer bell's the same thing
and you don't get tired of it, do you?

498
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:17,593
I don't have to bunk in the same room
with a steer.

499
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,398
You couldn't anyway.
The steer wouldn't let you.

500
00:43:24,919 --> 00:43:28,309
Evening.
Matt Lashan said I was to bunk here.

501
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:30,037
I'm a new hand.

502
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:34,307
Come on in.

503
00:43:35,439 --> 00:43:39,432
He'd have brought me down himself,
only he said you'd take good care...

504
00:43:42,479 --> 00:43:46,154
We'll take very good care of you.

505
00:44:02,279 --> 00:44:04,270
Ain't it a small world, though.

506
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:09,036
Stand still.
Keep those hands right where they are.

507
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:13,555
Where's that $10,000?

508
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:17,719
- Can we talk this over?
- Not tonight.

509
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:20,275
Go get his gun, Tennessee.

510
00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:26,078
Don't shoot. I'm here.

511
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:27,512
Go after him.

512
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,951
I got him.

513
00:44:31,959 --> 00:44:33,438
Get him inside.

514
00:44:34,399 --> 00:44:36,151
Somebody get a light.

515
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,478
Get him down.

516
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,868
What's the matter with you?
What's going on here?

517
00:44:49,959 --> 00:44:52,996
- Why didn't you say who you were?
- What do you think I was trying to do?

518
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:55,832
- We thought you were somebody else.
- You mean me?

519
00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:00,949
Nice little reception you had fixed up for me.

520
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:03,234
But I didn't think it would turn out
quite like this.

521
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:05,514
All right, drop those guns.

522
00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:09,030
Move back in that corner.
Come on, get moving.

523
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,713
Wait a minute, Thomas. Don't be in a rush.

524
00:45:11,799 --> 00:45:14,233
The boys that work for me
got pretty good jobs.

525
00:45:14,399 --> 00:45:18,358
We'd kind of like to have you stay,
join the family, wouldn't we, boys?

526
00:45:18,959 --> 00:45:23,749
- But that's the fella that held us up.
- I know. That's why I hired him.

527
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:27,556
There's an empty bunk right over there,
next to mine.

528
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:29,277
I'm Tennessee.

529
00:45:34,479 --> 00:45:35,912
Dan Thomas.

530
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,469
Openly speaking, we're what you might call
cattle separators.

531
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:40,958
- What?
- Don't you savvy?

532
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:43,394
We separate the cattle from the owners.

533
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:46,755
We ain't so awful busy, unless
someone tries to take a herd up north.

534
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:47,874
North?

535
00:45:47,959 --> 00:45:51,952
Then we raid them to keep them
from getting the cattle to market.

536
00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:53,633
What happens to the cattle you rustle?

537
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:56,233
We change the brands on them,
keep them hid.

538
00:45:56,399 --> 00:46:00,597
When the price gets high enough, we're
gonna take them up to Abilene ourselves.

539
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,348
According to that,
Lashan ought to make a lot of money.

540
00:46:03,439 --> 00:46:04,918
We all are.

541
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,755
This ain't the kind of a country
a man comes to for his health.

542
00:46:10,359 --> 00:46:11,428
No.

543
00:46:13,439 --> 00:46:15,714
I ain't so much interested
in my health, either.

544
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:26,869
Round them up, boys!

545
00:46:57,352 --> 00:47:00,469
Men, the reason I asked you to meet here
in secret like this is...

546
00:47:00,552 --> 00:47:02,907
we've got to take some steps
to protect ourselves.

547
00:47:03,032 --> 00:47:06,229
I'm fed up on the whole thing.
It ain't worth it.

548
00:47:08,032 --> 00:47:10,751
The trouble with us is,
we're not organized like the rustlers are.

549
00:47:10,832 --> 00:47:13,824
Look at Townsend. They
slaughtered his cattle and burnt him out.

550
00:47:13,952 --> 00:47:16,307
- I don't want that to happen to me.
- It won't.

551
00:47:16,392 --> 00:47:19,065
From now on,
we're going to fight fire with fire.

552
00:47:19,152 --> 00:47:20,983
That's why I asked you to come here.

553
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:24,906
Right here in Texas,
we've got the greatest gunslingers there are.

554
00:47:24,992 --> 00:47:27,870
John Wesley Hardin,
Clay Allison, King Fisher...

555
00:47:27,952 --> 00:47:30,341
Jim Courtright, Manning Clements...

556
00:47:31,312 --> 00:47:33,428
and I want to hire them to work for us.

557
00:47:33,512 --> 00:47:35,628
Dusty's right, that's what we need.

558
00:47:38,752 --> 00:47:40,390
Blaire, come on!

559
00:47:52,152 --> 00:47:53,551
What happened?

560
00:47:54,752 --> 00:47:55,980
Father!

561
00:48:14,272 --> 00:48:17,867
I'm going out to California.
I'm going to give Texas back to the outlaws.

562
00:48:17,952 --> 00:48:21,831
- You can't lick this thing by running away.
- And you can't lick something you can't see.

563
00:48:21,912 --> 00:48:24,790
It's four months since Dusty was killed.
Nobody's been caught yet.

564
00:48:24,872 --> 00:48:28,785
All the sheriff ever does is go out
and look around and come back and say:

565
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:31,864
"The rustlers must have come down
from the Indian nations."

566
00:48:31,952 --> 00:48:35,627
- We just have to keep on trying.
- It ain't as easy as that, Matthews.

567
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:39,182
If I could get a fair price for mine,
I'd sell out, too.

568
00:48:40,152 --> 00:48:42,063
Evening, Mike. Evening, Tod.

569
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:43,790
- Hello, Doc.
- Evening, Doc.

570
00:48:43,872 --> 00:48:46,181
This ain't a very good place for it, is it?

571
00:48:46,272 --> 00:48:47,990
- For what?
- Sparking.

572
00:48:48,272 --> 00:48:51,628
In my day, a young feller didn't stand
along the main street doing his sparking.

573
00:48:51,712 --> 00:48:52,906
Doc.

574
00:48:53,072 --> 00:48:55,905
- When's the marriage coming off?
- Marriage?

575
00:48:55,992 --> 00:48:58,426
You've heard of it, ain't you?

576
00:48:58,752 --> 00:49:00,663
He hasn't asked me yet.

577
00:49:01,152 --> 00:49:04,383
Four months and he ain't popped
the question yet?

578
00:49:04,832 --> 00:49:06,185
Evening, Bert.

579
00:49:07,312 --> 00:49:08,825
I think we'd better go in now, don't...

580
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:13,303
You may know how to run a ranch,
young man, but you sure can't run her.

581
00:49:18,112 --> 00:49:19,989
We might as well go in.

582
00:49:20,472 --> 00:49:22,383
Yes, I guess we better.

583
00:49:27,392 --> 00:49:28,711
Good evening, folks.

584
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:31,670
Hello, there, how are you? Oh, Albert.

585
00:49:31,872 --> 00:49:35,467
Doc, how about a little tune
while we're waiting?

586
00:49:35,552 --> 00:49:38,703
I ain't heard that organ
since you brought it in here.

587
00:49:38,992 --> 00:49:40,550
- You will tonight.
- Learnt to play it yet?

588
00:49:40,632 --> 00:49:42,270
I don't have to.
I got a first class accompanist.

589
00:49:42,352 --> 00:49:43,671
- Mike.
- Yeah?

590
00:49:43,792 --> 00:49:44,827
They want a little music.

591
00:49:44,912 --> 00:49:46,584
- How about wakening them up?
- Sure.

592
00:49:46,672 --> 00:49:50,301
Tod here can do the pumping.
He ought to be useful for something.

593
00:49:50,392 --> 00:49:52,587
- I thought you said this meeting was free.
- It is.

594
00:49:52,672 --> 00:49:54,742
Kind of looks like I'm paying.

595
00:50:00,752 --> 00:50:04,631
Tod, see that man over there
with the leather jacket?

596
00:50:04,712 --> 00:50:07,943
- What about him?
- He's the one who held me up.

597
00:50:08,032 --> 00:50:09,181
Yeah?

598
00:50:12,432 --> 00:50:16,061
- Come here, I'd like to talk...
- Tod, you old buzzard.

599
00:50:16,152 --> 00:50:17,426
You old son of a gun,
what are you doing here?

600
00:50:17,512 --> 00:50:19,662
- What are you doing here?
- How'd you get away?

601
00:50:19,752 --> 00:50:21,788
- They couldn't run fast.
- I thought they'd have...

602
00:50:21,872 --> 00:50:24,261
What is this?
You two act like long-lost brothers.

603
00:50:24,352 --> 00:50:27,389
- We are, sort of.
- lf it isn't the Cactus Kid.

604
00:50:27,632 --> 00:50:28,985
- Hello.
- Stay away from me.

605
00:50:29,072 --> 00:50:30,824
Yeah, what's this about
you trying to kidnap her?

606
00:50:30,912 --> 00:50:32,265
Is that what she told you?

607
00:50:32,512 --> 00:50:35,231
- I wasn't trying to kidnap her.
- You were, too.

608
00:50:35,312 --> 00:50:38,782
I was just in a hurry to get a ride that day.
You ought to remember.

609
00:50:38,872 --> 00:50:42,911
That day? Mike, this is Danny.
He's the fella I told you about.

610
00:50:43,752 --> 00:50:46,824
Mike, I'm sorry
for the way I messed you up...

611
00:50:47,152 --> 00:50:48,551
- but then you were awful stubborn.
- I was...

612
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:50,111
All I wanted was one horse, but you...

613
00:50:50,192 --> 00:50:53,104
You were lucky I didn't take a shot at you,
that's all.

614
00:50:53,272 --> 00:50:55,228
That makes us even. Friends?

615
00:50:58,192 --> 00:51:00,547
Mike, Tod, come on over here.

616
00:51:00,632 --> 00:51:03,192
Let's get this music started
before these folks fall asleep.

617
00:51:03,272 --> 00:51:04,591
All right, Doc.

618
00:51:04,672 --> 00:51:07,584
- Come on, you can help me pump.
- Sure enough.

619
00:51:10,632 --> 00:51:13,305
Now we're gonna start with <i>Buffalo Gals.</i>

620
00:51:13,392 --> 00:51:16,543
And I want you to whoop it up
when I get to you.

621
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:22,109
Give me a "G" or something
on that organ there.

622
00:51:24,472 --> 00:51:27,111
<i>As I was walking down the street</i>

623
00:51:27,192 --> 00:51:29,148
<i>Down the street, down the street</i>

624
00:51:29,232 --> 00:51:31,268
<i>A pretty little girl I chanced to meet</i>

625
00:51:31,352 --> 00:51:33,024
<i>And she was fair to view</i>

626
00:51:33,112 --> 00:51:35,501
<i>Oh, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya</i>

627
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,425
<i>Coming out tonight, coming out tonight,</i>
<i>coming out tonight</i>

628
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,628
<i>Oh, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya</i>
<i>coming out tonight</i>

629
00:51:40,712 --> 00:51:42,543
<i>And dance by the light of the moon</i>

630
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:45,988
<i>Her teeth were white as the drifted snow</i>

631
00:51:46,072 --> 00:51:47,983
<i>The drifted snow, the drifted snow</i>

632
00:51:48,072 --> 00:51:50,267
<i>She said she bought them</i>
<i>in a hardware store</i>

633
00:51:50,352 --> 00:51:51,831
<i>She was fair to view</i>

634
00:51:51,912 --> 00:51:55,222
<i>Oh, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya</i>
<i>coming out tonight</i>

635
00:51:55,392 --> 00:51:57,269
<i>coming out tonight, coming out tonight</i>

636
00:51:57,352 --> 00:51:59,468
<i>Oh, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya</i>
<i>coming out tonight</i>

637
00:51:59,592 --> 00:52:01,787
- Ain't you?
<i>- And dance by the light of the moon</i>

638
00:52:01,872 --> 00:52:04,466
<i>Your eyes are like the stars so bright</i>

639
00:52:04,592 --> 00:52:06,389
<i>Stars so bright, stars so bright</i>

640
00:52:06,472 --> 00:52:08,508
<i>I hope they don't come out at night</i>

641
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:10,264
<i>You are so fair to view</i>

642
00:52:10,392 --> 00:52:12,383
<i>Oh, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya</i>

643
00:52:12,472 --> 00:52:14,463
I thought you were gonna help me pump.

644
00:52:14,552 --> 00:52:17,225
I can't pump and look at her
at the same time.

645
00:52:17,312 --> 00:52:21,066
That's the girl for me.
Want to come to the wedding?

646
00:52:21,232 --> 00:52:23,746
Now look here, Danny, Mike is not...

647
00:52:25,112 --> 00:52:28,309
<i>She bellered like an ailing steer</i>
<i>She was fair to</i>

648
00:52:30,192 --> 00:52:31,591
<i>And she was</i>

649
00:52:31,952 --> 00:52:33,101
<i>She</i>

650
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:45,631
- What's the matter here?
- I don't know. The handle came out.

651
00:52:45,712 --> 00:52:49,102
The dang thing's always coming out.
Get it right in.

652
00:52:49,352 --> 00:52:51,820
- There. Now, get going.
- All right.

653
00:52:56,672 --> 00:52:58,071
That's just fine.

654
00:52:58,832 --> 00:53:00,550
Keep right on going.

655
00:53:04,632 --> 00:53:09,308
<i>I'm a hen-pecked man</i>
<i>but I don't care, I don't care, I don't care</i>

656
00:53:09,392 --> 00:53:13,385
<i>Her father's got millions and she's the heir</i>
<i>And she was fair to view</i>

657
00:53:13,472 --> 00:53:16,464
<i>Oh, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya</i>
<i>coming out tonight</i>

658
00:53:16,552 --> 00:53:18,144
<i>coming out tonight, coming out tonight</i>

659
00:53:18,232 --> 00:53:20,951
<i>Oh, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya</i>
<i>coming out tonight</i>

660
00:53:21,032 --> 00:53:25,264
<i>And dance by the light of the moon</i>

661
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,893
Hello, Windy.

662
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:42,729
I'm sorry I'm so late.

663
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,572
I've been entertaining them. Take it away.

664
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:45,979
Right you are.

665
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,773
It sure is good to see you all again...

666
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,657
but we'll get sociable a little bit later.

667
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,129
I'll get right down to business.

668
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:56,530
I guess you all know
why I came down here from Abilene.

669
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,056
I worked hard promoting a railroad
to haul cattle...

670
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,539
and I ain't getting no cattle.

671
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,896
These cattle ain't quail.
They can't fly up there.

672
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,499
That's a point.

673
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:12,053
But you don't realise how badly the East
needs beef since the war has been over.

674
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:16,258
Maybe you can tell us how to get them
through the rustlers and Indians and raids.

675
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,656
If you think it's so easy to get them there...

676
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:21,652
- why don't you take them yourself?
- Yeah.

677
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,208
Brother, that's exactly why I'm here.

678
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:29,337
I'm going to buy the beef from you
right here and take it through myself.

679
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,612
But, remember this:

680
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:44,410
it's going to be just as tough on me getting
this beef to Abilene as it was on you.

681
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,933
That's right.

682
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,978
Since I'm the one
who has to take all the risk...

683
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:52,014
I feel that it's only fair
that we establish a price...

684
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,534
that will give me at least an even break.

685
00:54:55,820 --> 00:55:00,211
Since I'm the one who's going to have to
worry about the stampedes and things...

686
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:03,571
I figure that a fair price
for your beef would be...

687
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:06,254
- $2 a head.
- $2?

688
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:09,379
That wouldn't even pay for the hide.

689
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,573
Just a minute, friends.

690
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:15,249
I knew this was too good to be true.

691
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:20,735
You'd think from the way you're acting
I was trying to rustle your cattle.

692
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:24,938
There ain't a man in here who can say
that I ever took advantage of a living soul.

693
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,409
You're being a little unreasonable.

694
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,810
I think $2 a head for your beef is a fair price.

695
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,256
- What'll you sell them for?
- Yeah, what'll you get for them?

696
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,371
I don't even know
I'm going to get them through.

697
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,610
I might have to turn back
the same as you did.

698
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,736
Windy's right. We can't get them through...

699
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:43,459
and there ain't no sense
of fooling ourselves anymore.

700
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,008
Of course, $2 a head ain't very much.

701
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,059
You can have mine for $2.

702
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,529
I've got 4,000 heads you can have at $2.

703
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:52,969
Mine, too, I have 5,000.

704
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,698
You can have the Flying W.

705
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:58,090
- What's the matter with you?
- Listen, friends!

706
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,209
Maybe Windy is trying to help us...

707
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,774
and then again,
maybe he is trying to help himself.

708
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,250
You know as well as I do
if the East hasn't had beef for four years...

709
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,568
the market price is way up.

710
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:12,209
That means the average steer should bring
$15, $18 a head, maybe more.

711
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:15,696
I ask you people, just who
do you think Windy's more interested in:

712
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:18,409
us or himself?

713
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,615
Please, just a minute.

714
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,611
Shut up. Go ahead, Tod, say your piece.

715
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:24,737
- Yeah, go ahead.
- All right.

716
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,857
All I'm saying is that the $2 a head
that Windy's offering...

717
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,170
that may be a lot of money
to his way of thinking.

718
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:34,088
But $18 a head is a whole lot more
and that's what we can get in Abilene.

719
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:36,011
You've tried it and failed.

720
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,216
Sure we failed
because this is the same as the gold rush.

721
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,097
Everybody trying to get there first.

722
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:43,093
But you've proven what Dusty King
tried to tell them for months.

723
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,933
That the only way we'll make it
is to get together a big herd.

724
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,738
The biggest this state ever saw...

725
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:51,051
and some of them are bound to get through.
I ask you men here with big herds...

726
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:54,052
isn't $18 a head
worth taking some risks for?

727
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:06,218
- Come on outside and settle it like a man.
- What?

728
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,973
They're gonna be talking about cattle
for hours, let's go.

729
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:12,291
I happen to be interested
in what they're talking about.

730
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,297
That's because you've never listened to me.

731
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,940
Come on. Tod can take care of that.

732
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,615
What?

733
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,809
- Nope, you ain't.
- I ain't what?

734
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:42,939
You ain't as pretty in the moonlight
as you are in the sunlight.

735
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:46,251
Why you, blankety-blank
hamstrung hunk of jerky beef, l...

736
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:49,138
Don't get upset, nobody's perfect.

737
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,297
- I'll marry you, anyway.
- You...

738
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:52,893
I wouldn't marry you...

739
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:56,416
- if you were the last man in the world.
- Last man in the world.

740
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,612
Good night, Mike.

741
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,054
Come in.

742
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:22,415
Sit in the chair there, Windy.

743
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,970
It kind of bothered you, didn't it?

744
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:39,609
First time in my life I ever upset
the apple cart with one of my own speeches.

745
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,339
There ain't no use denying it.
We've got a mess on our hands.

746
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:45,651
You may remember I didn't want to come
to Texas in the first place.

747
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:48,208
- It was your idea.
- This is not the first idea...

748
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,973
something's happened to us.
You got a bad bicuspid there.

749
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,733
Wait a minute.
You fixed that the last time I was here.

750
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,572
- I did?
- You sure did.

751
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:01,130
It looks like there ain't but one thing
left to do. That's to get Tod Ramsey.

752
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,932
- I can go out there...
- I like you, Matt.

753
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:05,295
You're a simple man of direct action.

754
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,133
Thanks, Doc.

755
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:10,451
But it so happens that's the worst thing
we could do right now.

756
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:13,008
Let me take a look at that, Windy.

757
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:16,213
After that meeting tonight...

758
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:20,612
Tod Ramsey will be the rallying point
for every rancher in this section.

759
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,368
- Are you sure I put that in?
- Yes.

760
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:26,536
You ought to know.

761
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:34,259
If he gets hurt, I'm afraid
people will begin to wonder why.

762
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:37,938
That's 100% right. But remember this, Doc...

763
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,136
if one man gets through
to Abilene with his cattle...

764
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:43,053
we might as well throw all our ideas
out the window.

765
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,893
This young squirt
ain't going to get through.

766
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:49,052
We've just got to begin all over again...

767
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,292
at the beginning.

768
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:55,693
It came out.

769
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:01,818
I knew that wasn't one of mine.
It's one of them dang Kansas City jobs.

770
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:07,337
You go back to Abilene, Windy.

771
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:10,537
Matt, you take 1,000 head and join the drive.

772
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:13,054
That's crazy, Doc. Me join the drive?

773
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,176
lt'll be crazier if you don't.

774
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:18,577
The colour of this whole thing
has changed in the last few hours.

775
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,254
Every rancher around here
is going with him...

776
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:24,969
and the quickest way to attract attention
to yourself is not to go.

777
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:29,417
- But you're gonna raid them, ain't you?
- You can bet your life we are.

778
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,929
This time, they'll know it, too.

779
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:34,250
It'll hit them so hard that in the future...

780
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:38,492
not a man in this state
will move a steer out of his own backyard.

781
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,497
What do you know? You had two bad ones.

782
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:52,532
That's the trouble with using
that cheap stuff.

783
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:56,891
A little gold in that.

784
01:01:03,612 --> 01:01:05,284
<i>Forward eight, fall back eight</i>

785
01:01:05,372 --> 01:01:08,808
<i>Forward again, with a right, left through</i>
<i>and a right, left back</i>

786
01:01:10,532 --> 01:01:12,124
<i>Meet your pardner, promenade eight</i>

787
01:01:12,212 --> 01:01:14,806
<i>Round the old track</i>
<i>till you come out straight</i>

788
01:01:20,772 --> 01:01:24,128
<i>Alaman left with your left hand,</i>
<i>back to your pardner, right and left grand</i>

789
01:01:24,212 --> 01:01:27,568
<i>Rope that cow, brand that calf</i>
<i>Meet your honey with a once and a half</i>

790
01:01:27,652 --> 01:01:32,487
<i>Treat them all alike, treat them all the same</i>
<i>Treat them all alike, no cheating in the game</i>

791
01:01:34,452 --> 01:01:37,762
<i>Meet your pardner with an elbow whirl</i>
<i>Promenade around the world</i>

792
01:01:37,932 --> 01:01:40,526
<i>Promenade, you know where, I don't care</i>

793
01:01:40,652 --> 01:01:42,927
<i>And put that pretty girl in this chair</i>

794
01:01:46,612 --> 01:01:48,568
Time out for refreshments.

795
01:01:58,332 --> 01:02:01,961
While I'm still up here,
I want to make a little speech.

796
01:02:03,692 --> 01:02:07,765
Tomorrow is a big day
in the history of Texas.

797
01:02:08,452 --> 01:02:11,330
Tod Ramsey is going up the trail...

798
01:02:11,692 --> 01:02:13,569
with 6,000 head of cattle.

799
01:02:13,652 --> 01:02:16,166
Seven thousand, Doc, you forgot mine.

800
01:02:17,052 --> 01:02:20,283
Thanks, Lashan.
Seven thousand head of cattle.

801
01:02:20,572 --> 01:02:21,891
I want to say...

802
01:02:22,212 --> 01:02:26,524
here's hoping he gets through to Abilene,
without losing a single steer.

803
01:02:37,492 --> 01:02:41,280
- Sanctimonious old buzzard, ain't you?
- It pays, don't it?

804
01:02:42,212 --> 01:02:44,203
- How's things?
- Fine, Doc.

805
01:02:44,892 --> 01:02:46,041
Boys all set?

806
01:02:46,132 --> 01:02:49,727
- They're riding advance guard.
- Guard?

807
01:02:50,492 --> 01:02:54,087
- Just to see that nothing happens.
- That's good.

808
01:02:54,172 --> 01:02:57,482
- Doc, I want to talk to you about my teeth.
- What's the matter with them?

809
01:02:57,572 --> 01:02:59,449
They're noisy, that's what they are, listen.

810
01:02:59,532 --> 01:03:02,524
They're bound to clatter a little
at first until they get set.

811
01:03:02,692 --> 01:03:03,886
That ain't what you told me.

812
01:03:03,972 --> 01:03:06,611
Just keep right on chewing with them
and they'll be fine.

813
01:03:06,692 --> 01:03:09,445
You'll get them back
if they don't stop clicking.

814
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:13,645
Why so quiet?

815
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:19,252
- I'm just thinking.
- What about?

816
01:03:20,252 --> 01:03:22,720
Why are you going to New Orleans?

817
01:03:23,412 --> 01:03:25,482
To see about a new cattle market.

818
01:03:25,572 --> 01:03:28,564
- How long you gonna be gone?
- Couple of weeks.

819
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:32,291
- Going to miss me?
- You know I will.

820
01:03:33,412 --> 01:03:35,084
I'll miss you, too.

821
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:38,841
But then we'll be together a long time
after we're married.

822
01:03:43,092 --> 01:03:46,448
What's the matter?
You are in love with me, aren't you?

823
01:03:47,812 --> 01:03:51,282
- Is that what this is? Love?
- What else?

824
01:03:51,892 --> 01:03:53,689
I don't know, Dan.

825
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:56,408
It's all happened so fast.

826
01:03:57,812 --> 01:04:01,043
That's the way it's supposed to happen.
Fast.

827
01:05:16,572 --> 01:05:19,644
- What about it? When do we hit them?
- I want to talk about that.

828
01:05:19,732 --> 01:05:22,292
We've already let them come
farther than Lashan said.

829
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:24,888
He said to hit them
after they crossed the Red River.

830
01:05:24,972 --> 01:05:26,769
They did that three days ago.

831
01:05:26,892 --> 01:05:29,804
I know what he said.
You've told me enough.

832
01:05:30,692 --> 01:05:33,331
Why don't we move in there
and break up that drive?

833
01:05:33,492 --> 01:05:36,052
You act like you got a private reason
for not wanting to.

834
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:37,690
I have. Money.

835
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,046
Money?

836
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:43,045
Did you fellas ever try figure out
what you're getting out of this?

837
01:05:43,132 --> 01:05:46,408
- $45 a month.
- But we got a promise of a lot more.

838
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:49,764
You can't spend promises.
Look, we're rustling.

839
01:05:50,132 --> 01:05:52,521
Somebody's making big money
out of the cattle we rustle.

840
01:05:52,612 --> 01:05:56,571
Yet we take all the risks.
Ain't we entitled to some of the profits?

841
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:59,928
Maybe we are,
but Lashan would never stand for that.

842
01:06:00,172 --> 01:06:02,447
I don't think he'll have anything
to say about that.

843
01:06:02,532 --> 01:06:03,851
Wait a minute.

844
01:06:03,932 --> 01:06:07,971
Lashan's a friend of mine and I'm not going
to stand by and see anybody do him dirt.

845
01:06:08,092 --> 01:06:09,650
Hold that, Comstock...

846
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:12,804
and let Danny finish
what he was going to say.

847
01:06:16,132 --> 01:06:20,523
None of us ever expects to have
more than $50 apiece in our lives.

848
01:06:20,892 --> 01:06:24,965
But if I tell you how we can have
$2,000, $3,000, maybe $4,000 each...

849
01:06:25,052 --> 01:06:26,883
who would you listen to, me or Lashan?

850
01:06:26,972 --> 01:06:29,406
- I'd listen to you.
- So would I.

851
01:06:30,372 --> 01:06:33,170
- Me, too.
- I thought Lashan was a friend of yours.

852
01:06:34,012 --> 01:06:37,004
Well, he's $50 worth a friend, not $2,000.

853
01:06:37,732 --> 01:06:38,847
Then we're all agreed.

854
01:06:38,932 --> 01:06:40,160
- Sure.
- Yeah.

855
01:06:40,252 --> 01:06:41,401
Go ahead.

856
01:06:41,732 --> 01:06:45,645
We don't bother those cattle at all.
We let them go right on into Abilene.

857
01:06:45,732 --> 01:06:48,610
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm working on that.

858
01:07:04,732 --> 01:07:08,771
- What's the matter? Lose something?
- No, of course not.

859
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:59,855
Abilene's only about
10 or 12 miles from here.

860
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:02,295
- I ought to be back before dark.
- Think it'll work?

861
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:04,610
Can't help it.
This is the only road running south.

862
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:07,089
They gotta pass this way. See you later.

863
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:09,978
Kind of slick, ain't it?

864
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:22,619
- Who's the cattle buyer around here?
- I am.

865
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,770
I'm with that herd coming up from Texas.

866
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:27,215
You might like to know
we're bedded down 10 miles out.

867
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:28,938
Be here in the morning.

868
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:32,376
Don't tell anybody else about it.
I want them all.

869
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:33,808
First come, first served.

870
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:35,811
I'll come buy them right there.
How many heads you got?

871
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:38,414
- Seven thousand.
- I'll be there in an hour.

872
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,731
Bring the money with you.

873
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:57,094
Windy, I been looking for you.

874
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:58,772
- They got through.
- How do you know?

875
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:01,579
A cowboy just rode in.
Says they're bedding down 10 miles out.

876
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:03,855
Parkhill and the others are going
to buy the cattle.

877
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:07,455
We got to hurry. You find Red and
get the horses, I'll go pick up some money.

878
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:17,335
- Are they coming?
- They took it hook, line, and sinker.

879
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,217
They ought to be here in about
a half an hour.

880
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:22,258
- Got any more coffee there?
- What's this?

881
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:29,538
- Must be them.
- They sure didn't lose any time.

882
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:34,815
- Looks like they're anxious to do business.
- So are we, better get mounted.

883
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:51,731
What is this?

884
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:54,052
Hello, Windy, what are you doing here?

885
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:57,416
- Where's them cattle?
- About five or six miles further on.

886
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:00,936
- Why? You aiming to buy them?
- Yes, and if I don't get there first...

887
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:04,330
I'll have to pay three prices
for the lot of them.

888
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:10,294
- What's so funny?
- Windy, we're gonna give you an even break.

889
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:13,736
One price for the whole herd.
Hand over that money.

890
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:18,692
I ain't gonna argue. Hand it over or I'll blow
you off that horse and pick it up myself.

891
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:20,179
You sure you're not making a mistake?

892
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:23,218
- Come on, where is it?
- It's in my saddlebag.

893
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:32,138
- Pretty cute little trick.
- Ain't it?

894
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:38,730
- Just wanted to make sure.
- Think this up all by yourself?

895
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:41,175
Yeah. Come on, get off your horse.

896
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:42,693
- What?
- Get off!

897
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:49,131
How're we gonna get back to Abilene?

898
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:51,257
That 7,000 head of cattle you just bought...

899
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:53,410
will be along here first thing in the morning.

900
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:56,697
Just pick out the ones that fit your legs
and hop aboard.

901
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:03,576
That dirty little polecat can't do this to me!

902
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,810
Why didn't you do something?

903
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,297
All right, Mr. Ramsey, there's your cheque.

904
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,098
I'll take all the beef you can bring up.

905
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:19,659
We'll be back. The trail's open now.

906
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:21,935
- There's no stopping us.
- Good luck to you.

907
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:23,698
This calls for a little celebration.

908
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,340
Sure does.
You boys go on down to Bullshead.

909
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,650
- See you there soon as I cash this.
- We'll be there.

910
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:30,976
I've known for a week
something was wrong...

911
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:33,938
- but I couldn't do nothing by myself.
- This is wonderful.

912
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:36,773
It was my idea to get the railroad here
to haul in the beef.

913
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:39,853
I fought to bring in the first herd.
Now the town's full of cattle...

914
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:42,215
and not a single head of them is mine.

915
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:46,254
And just to make it perfect,
I'm out $20,000 on the deal.

916
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:49,412
You got to blame Doc Thorpe for that.
He hired Thomas.

917
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:53,539
This country ain't so big, but what
I won't catch up with him one of these days.

918
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:57,056
- What are we going to do now?
- You do what you like.

919
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:01,173
I got to be the first to go down
and congratulate the cowboys...

920
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:03,615
on getting through to Abilene.

921
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:12,138
You already bought
what you wanted. Let's get out of here.

922
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:15,451
- What's the matter, scared?
- No, but this is Windy Miller's town.

923
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:18,498
We're crazy to be here.
We're asking for trouble.

924
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:21,174
Maybe you should've gone back
with the others.

925
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:22,978
I was just saying how crazy...

926
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:25,255
Go and see if the blacksmith's done
with our horses.

927
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:27,979
I'll meet you as soon as I pick up the saddle.

928
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:31,452
We're going to walk smack-dab
into something.

929
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,812
- Finished?
- Almost.

930
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:37,251
You by any chance one of them Texans
who brought up the cattle?

931
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:38,375
Yeah.

932
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:41,770
I thought nobody but a Texan
would buy a fancy thing like this.

933
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:43,134
Hurry it up, will you?

934
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:47,373
Listen here, young feller, nobody
ever done good work by hurrying yet.

935
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:51,209
And I ain't gonna spoil the looks of
this saddle by doing a bad job of engraving.

936
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:52,972
Looks all right to me.

937
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:56,769
Then your eyesight's bad,
because I ain't finished the "E."

938
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:59,418
Out of my light.

939
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:05,575
Come on up, fellows. It's on Texas!

940
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:16,734
No. He hasn't got that much nerve.

941
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:20,051
Maybe not,
but he's in the saddle store right now.

942
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:24,533
I'll see you boys in a couple of minutes.

943
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:27,500
You must think an awful lot of this Mike...

944
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:30,333
to give him as costly a saddle as this.

945
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:33,490
There you are. Take it away.

946
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:36,579
- Anything extra?
- No, Mike's thrown in.

947
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:44,251
What's your hurry, Tex?

948
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:51,099
I didn't expect to see you so soon.

949
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:54,175
I want that money back.

950
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:56,891
Sorry, Windy. It's too late.

951
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:05,049
I wouldn't if I were you. Drop it.

952
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:09,575
Don't bother to come back to Texas
'cause I'm taking over.

953
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:11,935
Come on, Danny, get off the street.

954
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:18,293
Windy Miller.

955
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:22,409
When I tell my grandchildren about this,
they won't believe it.

956
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:26,379
What are you doing in Abilene?
Where'd you get money for the saddle?

957
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:27,649
I told you my Uncle Rodney died.

958
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:30,653
You're not fooling me.
You held up those cattle buyers.

959
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:31,974
Think what you like.

960
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:36,053
I see the answer to a lot of things folks
back home have been wondering about.

961
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:39,016
You fell on one side of the fence
and I fell on the other.

962
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,375
- It's too late to argue about it.
- I won't argue, but...

963
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,297
Don't give me a lecture on morals.

964
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:46,856
You saved my life and I saved yours.
That makes us even.

965
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:49,056
And what I do from now on
is none of your business.

966
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:52,177
Yes, it is, because I happen to be in love
with Mike, too.

967
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:53,415
I never said anything to her...

968
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:57,254
because I knew how she felt about you.
That was all right with me up to now.

969
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:59,571
- So?
- You can't have her.

970
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:01,932
I don't think you'll have much to say
about that.

971
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:03,931
I'm saying it now.

972
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:06,449
Danny, we gotta get out of here.

973
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:09,771
Somebody just killed Windy Miller
and we'll get blamed, sure as shooting.

974
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:12,249
Got him smack-dab through the heart.

975
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:21,332
Sorry it had to end this way, Danny.
Remember what I told you.

976
01:15:34,748 --> 01:15:37,899
Look at all the decorations.
Wonder what's going on.

977
01:15:39,108 --> 01:15:41,702
Must be fixing up to welcome us back.

978
01:15:41,948 --> 01:15:44,860
As long as you don't see a rope
with a noose at one end, it ain't for us.

979
01:15:44,948 --> 01:15:46,142
Giddyup.

980
01:15:55,188 --> 01:15:56,541
Hello, there.

981
01:15:56,628 --> 01:15:59,461
Hi, Doc. What's all the flags out for?

982
01:15:59,668 --> 01:16:02,580
Tod Ramsey and the others
got through to Abilene with their cattle.

983
01:16:02,668 --> 01:16:04,704
We're fixing to welcome them home.

984
01:16:04,788 --> 01:16:08,383
That's fine. Now maybe
Lashan will pay us that back salary.

985
01:16:08,468 --> 01:16:12,143
This ought to cause a lot of debts
to be paid off.

986
01:16:12,228 --> 01:16:14,617
- How was New Orleans?
- All right.

987
01:16:15,148 --> 01:16:17,821
- Spare me a minute?
- I guess so. What's on your mind?

988
01:16:17,908 --> 01:16:19,899
Come on up to the office.

989
01:16:20,468 --> 01:16:22,857
- Wait here for me, Tennessee.
- Sure.

990
01:16:24,188 --> 01:16:27,544
I understand you're taking over
Matt Lashan's ranch?

991
01:16:29,908 --> 01:16:32,581
- News travels fast, don't it?
- Don't it?

992
01:16:33,508 --> 01:16:36,659
Matt and I made sort of a deal.

993
01:16:37,588 --> 01:16:40,898
- That's a bad deal for you.
- Yeah? Why?

994
01:16:41,828 --> 01:16:43,739
It ain't his to begin with.

995
01:16:44,068 --> 01:16:45,945
- Whose is it?
- It's mine.

996
01:16:46,028 --> 01:16:47,825
- Yours?
- That's right.

997
01:16:49,948 --> 01:16:53,577
- Then you and Windy were a combine?
- Yeah.

998
01:16:56,468 --> 01:17:00,097
I gotta hand it to you, Doc, you're all right.

999
01:17:00,508 --> 01:17:03,500
Thank you, Danny, so are you.

1000
01:17:04,908 --> 01:17:06,899
You're a little ambitious...

1001
01:17:07,188 --> 01:17:10,100
but I think we can work that out, can't we?

1002
01:17:10,348 --> 01:17:12,782
Anything you say from now on goes, Doc.

1003
01:17:12,868 --> 01:17:15,098
I gotta take my hat off to you.

1004
01:17:15,228 --> 01:17:17,583
I ain't butting in, am I, boys?

1005
01:17:17,908 --> 01:17:20,422
You're faster than the telegraph.

1006
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:22,778
Ain't you forgot
what I told you up in Abilene?

1007
01:17:22,868 --> 01:17:24,347
Take it easy, Danny.

1008
01:17:24,428 --> 01:17:25,543
If he's in, I'm out.

1009
01:17:25,628 --> 01:17:29,098
We can settle this later.
Put that hogleg away.

1010
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:39,577
If you and me's gonna be partners,
you're gonna have to depend on me a little.

1011
01:17:41,068 --> 01:17:42,137
Go on.

1012
01:17:42,228 --> 01:17:45,140
I like you, Dan. I like the way you act...

1013
01:17:45,908 --> 01:17:48,376
even though you did let
them cattle get through.

1014
01:17:48,468 --> 01:17:52,427
What's done is done
and maybe it's for the best after all.

1015
01:17:52,908 --> 01:17:57,379
It sort of establishes this Tod Ramsey
as a man able to perform miracles.

1016
01:17:58,148 --> 01:18:00,787
From now on, they'll sort of
look up to him as a leader...

1017
01:18:00,868 --> 01:18:03,302
since he's inherited Dusty's place.

1018
01:18:03,388 --> 01:18:06,346
They'll go when he goes, not before.

1019
01:18:08,348 --> 01:18:12,227
And if he don't go at all, they won't go at all.

1020
01:18:13,348 --> 01:18:15,304
Don't that sound simple?

1021
01:18:16,908 --> 01:18:19,866
- All we have to do is kill Tod Ramsey.
- Exactly.

1022
01:18:20,348 --> 01:18:21,667
That'll scare them off.

1023
01:18:21,748 --> 01:18:24,581
And even if two or three more
do try to get through after that...

1024
01:18:24,668 --> 01:18:26,784
they won't be hard to stop.

1025
01:18:27,028 --> 01:18:29,701
I think you forgot something,
ain't you, Doc?

1026
01:18:30,548 --> 01:18:32,584
Wait a minute, Danny.

1027
01:18:32,828 --> 01:18:34,705
In a normal situation...

1028
01:18:34,788 --> 01:18:39,339
I can see where a young man would rebel
at the idea of killing his best friend...

1029
01:18:40,068 --> 01:18:44,141
but this ain't a normal situation.
It's just like a bad bicuspidy.

1030
01:18:45,428 --> 01:18:49,216
I'm with you all the way, Doc,
except we don't touch Tod.

1031
01:18:50,108 --> 01:18:54,147
Let's not you and me start this
partnership with a difference of opinion.

1032
01:18:54,228 --> 01:18:57,459
I'm better qualified to do the thinking
than you are.

1033
01:18:57,548 --> 01:19:01,621
You better start thinking then,
because we're not gonna touch Tod.

1034
01:19:33,748 --> 01:19:35,147
Blankety-blank.

1035
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:37,423
Ain't that a new petticoat?

1036
01:19:39,748 --> 01:19:42,387
- I ought to... Oh, Danny.
- Hi, Mike.

1037
01:19:45,748 --> 01:19:48,820
That's a fine way to treat a present
I bring, kicking it around like that.

1038
01:19:48,908 --> 01:19:50,944
Present? What?

1039
01:19:57,668 --> 01:20:01,820
It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
It's got my name on it.

1040
01:20:02,108 --> 01:20:05,862
- You shouldn't buy me presents like this.
- That's only the beginning.

1041
01:20:06,308 --> 01:20:10,142
I'm so happy I could almost explode.
Everything happens at once.

1042
01:20:10,308 --> 01:20:13,539
Tod sells our cattle, and you come home.

1043
01:20:14,028 --> 01:20:17,020
- Did you miss me?
- More than you'll ever know.

1044
01:20:17,188 --> 01:20:20,942
We'll take care of that.
Let's get married. Right away. Today.

1045
01:20:21,068 --> 01:20:22,581
Without Tod?

1046
01:20:23,748 --> 01:20:27,423
- What's Tod got to do with it?
- He's your best friend.

1047
01:20:27,548 --> 01:20:30,984
- We'll surprise him.
- No, I couldn't.

1048
01:20:31,508 --> 01:20:32,702
Why not?

1049
01:20:32,788 --> 01:20:36,861
Silly, a girl can't just square off
and get married like that.

1050
01:20:37,068 --> 01:20:38,660
You have to have clothes...

1051
01:20:38,748 --> 01:20:40,739
Besides, they're coming back
from Abilene tomorrow.

1052
01:20:40,828 --> 01:20:44,741
Lashan's here now and he said
the others were right behind him.

1053
01:20:45,428 --> 01:20:46,463
You wouldn't want me...

1054
01:20:46,548 --> 01:20:49,904
to have all the excitement in my life
at one time, would you?

1055
01:20:50,788 --> 01:20:53,825
It seems the wrong way
to start out married life...

1056
01:20:54,188 --> 01:20:55,906
but you're the boss.

1057
01:20:59,292 --> 01:21:02,170
Here they come!

1058
01:21:40,972 --> 01:21:42,371
- Tod.
- Mike.

1059
01:21:42,452 --> 01:21:45,091
It's about time
you paid some attention to me.

1060
01:21:45,172 --> 01:21:47,447
- Nice going, Tod.
- To think that you've really done it.

1061
01:21:47,532 --> 01:21:51,207
- lf only Dad could have been here.
- That would have been nice.

1062
01:21:51,572 --> 01:21:53,130
- How was New Orleans?
- Fine.

1063
01:21:53,212 --> 01:21:55,487
You should see the wonderful present
he brought me.

1064
01:21:55,652 --> 01:21:57,404
Wouldn't be a saddle by any chance,
would it?

1065
01:21:57,492 --> 01:21:59,881
- How did you know?
- I know Danny.

1066
01:22:00,212 --> 01:22:03,045
- You're not married yet, are you?
- No, we were waiting for you.

1067
01:22:03,332 --> 01:22:05,084
That was thoughtful of you.

1068
01:22:05,972 --> 01:22:07,849
Tod, come on, we're waiting for you.

1069
01:22:07,932 --> 01:22:10,127
Come on, hurry up.
The gang is here watching.

1070
01:22:10,212 --> 01:22:12,965
All right, I'm coming.
I guess I better get over there.

1071
01:22:13,052 --> 01:22:16,727
Do you mind if I tear your prospective
bridegroom away for a drink to celebrate?

1072
01:22:16,972 --> 01:22:18,610
No, take him along.

1073
01:22:18,692 --> 01:22:21,525
Why don't they have saloons
that women can go into?

1074
01:22:21,652 --> 01:22:23,927
- I'll build you one.
- Oh, you.

1075
01:22:26,052 --> 01:22:27,451
Come on here.

1076
01:22:40,612 --> 01:22:41,965
- Fine job, fella.
- Thanks.

1077
01:22:42,052 --> 01:22:43,371
What's it gonna be?

1078
01:22:43,452 --> 01:22:44,487
- Bourbon.
- Bourbon.

1079
01:22:44,572 --> 01:22:46,369
- Nice work, Tod.
- Thanks, Bob.

1080
01:22:46,452 --> 01:22:48,124
Here you are, my boy, the best in the house.

1081
01:22:48,212 --> 01:22:51,363
- When did you start drinking?
- Just now.

1082
01:22:52,492 --> 01:22:56,007
- I want to shake hands with you, Tod.
- Thanks, Stub.

1083
01:22:56,572 --> 01:22:58,563
Go in the back room. I want to talk to you.

1084
01:22:58,732 --> 01:23:01,963
- Go on, talk.
- This is private, go on.

1085
01:23:04,572 --> 01:23:06,369
I'll see you later, fellows.

1086
01:23:30,332 --> 01:23:34,644
I've been with you long enough
to know you can't be made to do anything.

1087
01:23:34,772 --> 01:23:36,967
But you've gotta see this isn't fair to Mike.

1088
01:23:37,092 --> 01:23:39,686
- What ain't fair?
- Marrying her.

1089
01:23:41,492 --> 01:23:43,244
Why don't you say
you want her for yourself?

1090
01:23:43,372 --> 01:23:44,725
That has nothing to do with it.

1091
01:23:44,812 --> 01:23:47,804
Sure, you're just thinking of her future.

1092
01:23:50,212 --> 01:23:53,409
I wouldn't call it very much
of a future being married to you...

1093
01:23:53,572 --> 01:23:56,325
spending the rest of her life on the run.

1094
01:23:56,732 --> 01:23:59,485
I ain't running anywhere.
I can take care of myself.

1095
01:23:59,572 --> 01:24:02,928
- Sure, you can, but what about her?
- Let's drop it.

1096
01:24:03,692 --> 01:24:05,762
You said it once yourself.

1097
01:24:05,892 --> 01:24:08,964
You fell on one side of the fence,
I fell on the other.

1098
01:24:09,052 --> 01:24:13,728
That's the way it still is and I got a feeling
that's the way it'll always be.

1099
01:24:13,932 --> 01:24:17,163
Is that any kind of life to offer a girl? Is it?

1100
01:24:17,412 --> 01:24:21,485
You know it isn't. You're just
too doggone stubborn to admit it.

1101
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:27,202
Come on, what do you say?
Let's get out of here.

1102
01:24:28,172 --> 01:24:31,209
I'll leave with you.
That's how much I think of her.

1103
01:24:36,372 --> 01:24:39,808
- You would, too, wouldn't you?
- Let's get started.

1104
01:24:41,452 --> 01:24:43,443
You don't have to leave with me.

1105
01:24:52,572 --> 01:24:55,006
- He shot Tod.
- Run, Danny, run.

1106
01:25:01,332 --> 01:25:02,606
Break it up.

1107
01:25:07,972 --> 01:25:09,564
All right, Lashan.

1108
01:25:18,332 --> 01:25:20,323
Go around the other way.

1109
01:25:27,332 --> 01:25:29,050
Pardon me, Sheriff.

1110
01:25:41,852 --> 01:25:43,126
On the roof.

1111
01:25:44,052 --> 01:25:45,121
What do you think, Doc?

1112
01:25:45,252 --> 01:25:47,641
He ain't bad hurt, just a flesh wound.
Get him to my office.

1113
01:25:47,732 --> 01:25:49,211
Pick him up.

1114
01:26:10,092 --> 01:26:12,606
Tod, what happened?
They say Danny shot you.

1115
01:26:12,692 --> 01:26:14,683
- That's not true, he didn't.
- Then who did?

1116
01:26:14,772 --> 01:26:16,410
I don't know, but it wasn't Danny.

1117
01:26:16,492 --> 01:26:17,720
- We've got to do something.
- Now...

1118
01:26:17,812 --> 01:26:19,609
If those men catch him, they'll kill him.

1119
01:26:19,692 --> 01:26:23,048
Don't worry. They won't catch him.
They won't even come close.

1120
01:26:40,652 --> 01:26:42,927
He's in there, men, spread out.

1121
01:27:43,692 --> 01:27:44,727
Danny!

1122
01:27:55,372 --> 01:27:58,091
<i>As I was strolling down the street</i>

1123
01:27:58,252 --> 01:28:00,607
<i>Down the street, down the street</i>

1124
01:28:00,852 --> 01:28:02,968
<i>A pretty little girl I chanced to meet</i>

1125
01:28:03,212 --> 01:28:05,168
<i>And she was fair to view</i>

1126
01:28:05,732 --> 01:28:09,645
<i>Oh, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya, ain't ya</i>
<i>coming out tonight, coming out</i>

1127
01:28:11,972 --> 01:28:13,690
This is it, Doc.

1128
01:28:13,812 --> 01:28:15,609
Wait a minute, Danny.

1129
01:28:15,692 --> 01:28:18,684
Don't you think we'd better
talk this thing over?

1130
01:28:38,812 --> 01:28:40,040
Oh, Danny.

1131
01:28:41,305 --> 01:28:47,237
