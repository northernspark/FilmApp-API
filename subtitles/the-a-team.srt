00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,367
Captain, in nearly 40 years
of being in this army,

660
00:36:44,618 --> 00:36:46,786
l have learned to control my temper

661
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:51,207
and my voice when in the presence
of a subordinate officer

662
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:55,295
who, for at least the time being,
seems to have lost her goddamn mind.

663
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,298
Now, it is my understanding

664
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,300
that yöu have a question for me.
ls that correct?

yöu are correct, sir.

666

667

in a military fashion,

669
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,107
then perhaps we could get somewhere
with this discussion.

670
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:20,236
lf yöu have sent an Alpha Team into
Baghdad for any reason whatsoever,

671
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,615
that is a direct violation of a DoD order.

2123
02:04:47,020 --> 02:04:50,314
Well, that's one hell of a mess.
But we did get the plates.

2124
02:04:51,733 --> 02:04:54,986
Unfortunately, l'm gonna have to charge
yöu all with escaping lawful custody.

2125
02:04:55,070 --> 02:04:56,779
What? Hannibal,
what is this guy talking about?

2126
02:04:56,864 --> 02:05:00,575
B.A., we were wrongly convicted,
but it's still illegal to break out of jail.

2127
02:05:00,659 --> 02:05:01,993
Director McCready, Smith and his team

2128
02:05:02,077 --> 02:05:03,536
were instrumental
in recovering those plates.

2129
02:05:03,620 --> 02:05:07,707
They're still level 1 0 federal fugitives
and l need that off my desk.

2130
02:05:07,791 --> 02:05:09,792
This is chickenshit, sir.

2131
02:05:10,043 --> 02:05:12,295
Yeah, well, yöu know what?
Perhaps for them, it is chickenshit,

2132
02:05:12,379 --> 02:05:15,756
but for yöu, Captain, we're re-promoting
yöu to yöur former rank.

2133
02:05:15,841 --> 02:05:17,174
So, look, they're gonna be delivered

2134
02:05:17,259 --> 02:05:18,801
to the U.S. Marshals Service
here in Long Beach.

<font color="#808080">-</font>  This is really unfair, sir.

to fix it.

Nice plan, Face.

2148
02:06:23,241 --> 02:06:27,036
Yeah. We just traded Lynches,
and we're going back to prison.

2149
02:06:27,162 --> 02:06:29,080
<font color="#ffff00">HANNIBAL:</font> We returned the plates.
We can hold our heads high.

2151
02:06:30,457 --> 02:06:33,626
Yeah, and look what they did to us.
This is some bullshit.

We trusted the system and it turned on us.

2154

Remember, boys, no matter
how random things might appear,

2155
02:06:42,094 --> 02:06:44,637
there is still a plan. Kid.
