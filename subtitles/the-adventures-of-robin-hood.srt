00:01:32,408 --> 00:01:34,899
News has come from Vienna!

3
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:39,912
''Leopold of Austria has seized King Richard
on his return from the Crusades.

4
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:44,918
Our king is being held prisoner.
Nothing further is known.

5
00:01:45,088 --> 00:01:50,424
His Highness Prince John will make
further public pronouncement tomorrow.''

6
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:56,297
And how are the dear Saxons
taking the news, Sir Guy?

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,434
They're even more worried than Longchamps,
Your Highness.

8
00:01:59,602 --> 00:02:03,402
They'll be more than worried when l squeeze
the fat out of their pampered hides.

9
00:02:03,573 --> 00:02:07,134
-You intend to act on your plans?
-What better moment than this, Sir Guy?

10
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,974
Whoever would have thought my dear brother
would be so considerate as to get captured...

11
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:16,448
...and leave all of England to my tender care?

12
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:18,917
He may disapprove when he returns,
Your Highness.

13
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:22,251
lf he returns.
And l'll see to it that he doesn't.

14
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:27,954
We must drink to this moment, Sir Guy.
Golden days are ahead.

15
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:31,893
l'll assign tax districts to you tomorrow.

16
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:34,497
Tomorrow, Your Highness.

17
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:48,109
-But who's gonna pay me?
-Pay! Pay!

18
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:50,184
That's all you Saxons think about.

19
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:54,983
Didn't l tell you it was for Prince John,
who's just come up from London?

20
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:03,126
Stop! Stop!

21
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:06,162
This man is freeborn!
He's a landowner.

22
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:08,270
You can't make a slave of him!

23
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,839
Didn't he refuse to send his men
to work in Guy of Gisbourne's field?

24
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:13,805
But l protest--!

25
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,205
Dickon, follow me!
The rest remain here.

26
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:17,704
-What's your name, you Saxon dog?
-A better one than yours.

27
00:04:17,874 --> 00:04:20,172
Look to your manners!
This is Sir Guy of Gisbourne.

28
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,005
Sir Guy or the devil!
There's little to choose between them.

29
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:26,539
-What's your name?
-Much, the miller's son.

30
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:30,174
-You know it's death to kill the king's deer?
-And death from hunger if l don't.

31
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,914
Thanks to you and the rest of you
Norman cutthroats at Nottingham Castle.

32
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,058
-Be quiet, you.
-l won't be quiet!

33
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:39,319
You can kill me if you like,
but not until l've had my say.

34
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:42,020
You can beat and starve
us Saxons now...

35
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,725
...but when King Richard escapes,
he'll take you by the scruff of the neck...

36
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:48,097
...and fling you into the sea!

37
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:02,348
-What the devil?
-Come now, Sir Guy.

38
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:05,453
-You'd not kill a man for telling the truth?
-lf it amused me, yes.

39
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:07,723
Be thankful my humor's of a different sort.

40
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,259
-By what right do you interfere with justice?
-By a better right than you have to misuse it.

41
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:14,396
That goes for your master, Prince John.

42
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,465
l'll give him that message at
the baron's meeting in Nottingham tonight.

43
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:20,761
Thank you.
He does need a bit of a talking to.

44
00:05:20,937 --> 00:05:23,565
-Eh, Will?
-Yes, he has been getting rather out of hand.

45
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:25,898
-Fetch him along.
-Hold there. What's his fault?

46
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:29,044
-He's killed a royal deer.
-You're wrong. l killed that deer.

47
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:30,543
This man's my servant.

48
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:35,144
l suppose you realize the penalty
for killing the king's deer is death.

49
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:38,719
-Whether for serf or noble.
-Really?

50
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:41,288
Are there no exceptions?

51
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,971
-Thanks, good master.
-Better look before you shoot next time.

52
00:05:58,141 --> 00:06:02,874
From this day, l follow only you. There
isn't a poor Saxon in Nottingham shire...

53
00:06:03,046 --> 00:06:05,606
...that doesn't know and bless
Sir Robin of Locksley.

54
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,409
Take me as your servant.

55
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:10,846
Why, in all the forest,
there isn't a hunter as good as me.

56
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,183
l ask no pay.
Just to follow you.

57
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:16,450
Fetch the deer, then.

58
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,906
While Richard is bent on adventure
in foreign lands...

59
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:08,635
...it is our duty as Normans
to preserve the realm...

60
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:13,805
...by giving loyal support to Prince John,
the only true defender of the Norman spirit.

61
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:16,543
Hail to Prince John.

62
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:31,499
My lords, l thank you.
Well, this is what we Normans like:

63
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:37,105
Good food, good company, and a beautiful
woman to flatter me, eh, Lady Marian?

64
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:39,501
Was it worthwhile coming with me
from London...

65
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:42,235
...to see what stout fellows
our Nottingham friends are?

66
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:47,075
Take Sir Guy of Gisbourne, now. One of our
most renowned defenders of the realm.

67
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,845
-Must l take him, Your Highness?
-Why, you like him, don't you?

68
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,719
-Well, he's a Norman, of course.
-ls that the only reason for liking him?

69
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,123
lsn't that reason enough for a royal ward
who must obey her guardian?

70
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:01,695
Oh, nay, l'd not force you, my lady.

71
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:06,665
But he's our most powerful friend in these
shires and he's already in love with you.

72
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:12,206
lf l could promise him marriage
to a royal ward, it might help my plans.

73
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,969
-Perhaps when l know him better.
-Of course.

74
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:17,738
You're a very wise young woman.

75
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,748
Any more objections to the new tax
from our Saxon friends?

76
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,317
Objections, Your Highness?

77
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:27,650
With a Saxon dangling from every
gallows tree between here and Charnwood?

78
00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:30,383
Well said, sir knight.
But not too many, mind.

79
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,826
Else we'll have nobody left
to till our land or pay the tax.

80
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:37,659
There's one exception l'd make,
Your Highness.

81
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,267
-A certain Saxon noble.
-Who is that?

82
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:45,965
-Sir Robin of Locksley.
-Sir Rob-- Sir Robin of Locksley?

83
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:50,169
Why, l've heard precious little else since
l've been here. What's his latest outrage?

84
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,646
Oh, nothing less than killing a royal deer
in Sherwood Forest today.

85
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:57,481
And you didn't take him?

86
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,778
That would have been a problem,
Your Highness.

87
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:04,154
-A Saxon a problem?
-He's a notorious troublemaker, my lady.

88
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:06,295
Aye.
An impudent, reckless rogue...

89
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,727
...who goes around the shire
stirring up the Saxons against authority.

90
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:13,595
And he has the insolence to set himself up
as a protector of the people.

91
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:17,330
-l could have captured him long ago, but....
-But what?

92
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:20,964
Well, he's the deadliest archer
in England, and....

93
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:25,739
And my brave High Sheriff of Nottingham
is afraid of him.

94
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:29,942
l want him taken and hanged. At once,
do you hear? l'll not tolerate--

95
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:31,652
Open the door!

96
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:52,964
Who is this, this...?

97
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:55,734
Sir Robin of Locksley, Your Highness.

98
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:02,542
Let him approach.

99
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,392
Greetings, Your Highness.

100
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:19,025
You should teach Gisbourne hospitality.

101
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,863
l no sooner enter his castle doors
with a piece of meat...

102
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,836
...than his starving servants
try to snatch it from me.

103
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,033
You should feed them, Gisbourne.
They'll work better.

104
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:31,803
With the compliments of your royal brother,
King Richard, God bless him!

105
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:35,909
By my faith, but you're a bold rascal.

106
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:39,077
Robin, l like you.

107
00:10:39,288 --> 00:10:41,017
l'm gratified, Your Highness.

108
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,750
l don't think Gisbourne shares
that sentiment, however.

109
00:10:44,126 --> 00:10:45,855
He does look sour.

110
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:48,795
What's the matter, Gisbourne?
Run out of hangings?

111
00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:51,592
-l know a ripe subject for one.
-lf you'll excuse me--

112
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:54,235
Sit down! Sit down, my dear.
He'll not harm you.

113
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,429
Sir Robin, this is the Lady Marian Fitzwalter.

114
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:01,335
l hope my lady had a pleasant journey
from London?

115
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:03,705
What you hope can hardly be important.

116
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:08,639
What a pity her manners
don't match her looks, Your Highness.

117
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,552
You hear that, gentlemen?

118
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,985
Here's Gisbourne so in love with Marian
he daren't say ''boo'' to her...

119
00:11:14,156 --> 00:11:17,455
...and this saucy fellow
gives her better than she sends.

120
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:22,495
My lords and ladies, l would like to present
to you Sir Robin of Locksley.

121
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:29,866
Sir Robin, permit me to present to you
your host, Sir Guy of Gisbourne...

122
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:33,998
-...and our noble guests.
-l'm deeply honored, Your Highness.

123
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:36,303
-Have you had meat?
-None but what l brought.

124
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,538
Well, sit down.
Sit down there opposite me.

125
00:11:38,714 --> 00:11:42,081
-Get up, Sir lvor, and give him your place.
-Your Highness!

126
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:43,912
Get up!
Get up, sir knight!

127
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,652
Come, Sir lvor.
Out with you.

128
00:11:46,822 --> 00:11:49,814
Bring Sir Robin food at once,
do you hear?

129
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:53,325
Such impudence must support
a mighty appetite.

130
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:54,861
True enough, Your Highness.

131
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:59,626
We Saxons have little to fatten on
by the time your tax gatherers are through.

132
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:03,063
Be seated, gentlemen. No need
to stand on ceremony on my account.

133
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,474
So you think you're overtaxed, eh?

134
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:11,135
Overtaxed, overworked and paid off
with a knife, a club or a rope.

135
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:14,214
-Why, you speak treason.
-Fluently.

136
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:16,783
l advise you to curb
that wagging tongue of yours!

137
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:18,680
lt's a habit l've never formed.

138
00:12:18,854 --> 00:12:23,052
You know, we Saxons aren't going to
put up with these oppressions much longer.

139
00:12:23,225 --> 00:12:26,388
Oh, you're not?
Then listen to this:

140
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:30,791
As you may know, my brother
is a prisoner of Leopold of Austria.

141
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:37,201
And from Leopold, l have received
a ransom demand of 1 50,000 gold marks.

142
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:40,069
That means that you, my friends...

143
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:44,406
...must collect in taxes not 2 gold marks
in the pound, but 3!

144
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,710
-And the money's to be turned over to me.
-Why to you, Your Highness?

145
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:53,287
-King Richard appointed Longchamps regent.
-l've kicked Longchamps out.

146
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:56,892
From now on, l am regent of England.

147
00:13:00,796 --> 00:13:02,889
Well, confound it,
what are you goggling at?

148
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:06,796
ls it so strange that l decide to rule
when my brother's a prisoner?

149
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:08,436
Who's to say l shouldn't?

150
00:13:08,604 --> 00:13:12,199
-You, Sir Mortimer of Leeds?
-Not l, Your Highness.

151
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:15,434
-You, Sir Boron?
-Nor l, Your Highness.

152
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,708
-You, Sir Ralf of Durham?
-My sword is yours, Your Highness.

153
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:23,507
And what about our young
Saxon cockerel here?

154
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,286
What's the matter?
Have you no stomach for honest meat?

155
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:32,456
For honest meat, yes.
But l've no stomach for traitors.

156
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:36,963
-You call me traitor?
-You? Yes.

157
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:39,532
And every man here
who offers you allegiance.

158
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,735
Your Highness.

159
00:13:46,842 --> 00:13:49,936
What do you call a man who takes advantage
of a king's misfortune...

160
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:51,374
...to seize his power?

161
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:54,539
And now, with the help
of this sweet band of cutthroats...

162
00:13:54,717 --> 00:13:58,517
...you'll try to grind a ransom for him
out of every helpless Saxon.

163
00:13:58,687 --> 00:14:03,989
A ransom that'll be used not to release
Richard, but to buy your way to the throne.

164
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,985
Let me ram those words down his throat,
Your Highness!

165
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:12,156
Oh, no. Later.
Let him spout for the moment.

166
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:15,826
And what do you propose to do?

167
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:23,174
l'll organize revolt.
Exact a death for a death.

168
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:27,145
And l'll never rest until every Saxon
in this shire can stand up, free men...

169
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:29,341
...and strike a blow for Richard and England.

170
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:32,180
-Have you finished?
-l'm only just beginning.

171
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:35,812
From this night on, l use every means
in my power to fight you.

172
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:38,188
Dickon!

173
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,489
Such impudence, Your Highness.
lf l could only reach him.

174
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,221
Stand back!
Stand back!

175
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,727
Open the door!

176
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,924
Quick, guards, quick!
There's a traitor inside trying to escape!

177
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:27,864
-Shut the door, quick!
-Traitor, sir?

178
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,824
You infernal idiot!
Which way did he go?

179
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:52,255
There, through the gate.

180
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:56,255
-After him!
-Guards! Horses!

181
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,265
Dickon, follow Mansfield!
To your troop!

182
00:18:58,086 --> 00:18:59,713
Up you go, quick.

183
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:02,916
Find Crippen
the arrow-maker and his friends...

184
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:06,060
...to pass the word to every man
who's been beaten or tortured:

185
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,696
-The Gallows Oaks in Sherwood tomorrow.
-Yes, master.

186
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:10,229
Off you go, and good luck.

187
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:35,686
Have it proclaimed in every village
that this Saxon Locksley's an outlaw.

188
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:38,759
-Hang anybody that gives him shelter or aid.
-Yes, Your Highness.

189
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:43,227
His possessions are forfeit to the crown.
Seize his castle and his lands.

190
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:45,764
Everything he owns.

191
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:49,728
And just to let the people know
how the wind has changed...

192
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:54,467
-...the sooner you begin collecting the--
-The ransom, Your Highness?

193
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:59,911
Yes, yes, of course.
The ransom.

194
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:07,151
There's a death sentence
for your Robin of Locksley!

195
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,054
l'll have him dangling in a week.

196
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:21,199
-l'm tired.
-What?

197
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,602
-After a refreshing sleep in the greenwood?
-l've pulled seven acorns out of my ribs.

198
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:28,743
-Lovely fresh air.
-My teeth ache with chattering.

199
00:20:28,911 --> 00:20:32,403
-Nightingales singing.
-An owl hooting in my ear all night.

200
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:35,607
Hooting?
He was singing you to sleep.

201
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:51,424
There's a lusty infant.
He'd be a good one to reason into joining us.

202
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,899
By the look of him,
his quarterstaff does his reasoning for him.

203
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,972
-Let's see what he's made of.
-lt's your skull, not mine.

204
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,143
-Give way, little man.
-Only to a better man than myself.

205
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,050
He stands before you.

206
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:16,724
Let him pass, Robin. lt's much too warm
to brawl with such a windbag.

207
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:20,658
When l've brushed this fly off,
l'll give you a dusting for good measure.

208
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:23,093
This fly has a mighty sting, friend.

209
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:26,995
l've only a staff and you threaten me
with a longbow and a goose shaft.

210
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:31,435
-Aren't you man enough--?
-Wait! l'll get myself a staff.

211
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:48,051
-Ready?
-Yes.

212
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:01,261
Hey, pretty fellow, play a livelier tune
that l can make this puny rascal dance to.

213
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:06,607
You need a merrier tune?
Well, how's this?

214
00:22:16,118 --> 00:22:18,382
lf you want a lesson,
you came to the right man!

215
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,646
-Where is he?
-Who?

216
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,755
-This quarterstaff master.
-Here.

217
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,483
Give my compliments to him.

218
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:30,221
My friend, l should ask payment
for what l'm teaching you here today.

219
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,267
There's something on account.

220
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:37,102
There's your change.

221
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:04,464
My head hums like a swarm of bees.
What's your name, friend?

222
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,830
-John Little. What's yours?
-Robin.

223
00:23:08,003 --> 00:23:10,096
-Not Robin of Locksley?
-Aye.

224
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:14,140
-Then l'm right glad l fell in with you.
-'Twas he who did the falling in.

225
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:19,704
l wanted to see what you were made of.
And l did.

226
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,708
-l hope you'll not hold it against me.
-On the contrary.

227
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:25,819
-l love a man that can best me.
-l'd like to join your company.

228
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:31,118
You shall. lf you can hold a breach like you
held that bridge, you're one of us. Welcome.

229
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:33,488
-This is Will of Gamwell.
-Yeah.

230
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:37,223
-He took good care not to wet his feathers.
-Just brain over brawn, friend.

231
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:42,897
You heard Robin's orders.
Look nippy now and spread the word.

232
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,473
''By royal decree, Robin of Locksley is
declared an outlaw, condemned to death.''

233
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:55,139
-Meet Robin in Sherwood at Gallows Oaks.
-''Any person aiding him will be hanged.''

234
00:23:55,317 --> 00:23:57,478
Meet Robin in Sherwood at Gallows Oaks.

235
00:23:58,787 --> 00:24:01,051
Robin in Sherwood.

236
00:24:01,223 --> 00:24:02,884
At the Gallows Oak.

237
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,150
Robin in Sherwood.

238
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:06,658
Robin. Gallows Oak.

239
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,765
Gallows Oak.

240
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:18,037
l've called you here as freeborn Englishmen,
loyal to our king.

241
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,401
While he reigned over us we lived in peace.

242
00:24:20,575 --> 00:24:22,839
But since Prince John has seized
the regency...

243
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:26,310
...Guy of Gisbourne and his traitors
have murdered and pillaged.

244
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:30,076
You've all suffered from their cruelty.
The ear loppings, the beatings...

245
00:24:30,252 --> 00:24:33,153
...the blindings with hot irons,
the burning of our homes...

246
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:36,381
...the mistreatment of our women.
lt's time we put an end to this!

247
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,118
-Robin's right.
-Aye!

248
00:24:39,694 --> 00:24:41,093
Now, this forest is wide.

249
00:24:41,263 --> 00:24:44,027
lt can shelter, clothe and feed
a band of good, determined men...

250
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:46,633
...good swordsmen, good archers,
good fighters!

251
00:24:46,801 --> 00:24:51,204
Men, if you're willing to fight for our people,
l want you. Are you with me?

252
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:52,897
Aye! Aye!

253
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,968
Then kneel and swear this oath.

254
00:24:58,313 --> 00:25:03,615
That you, the freemen of this forest, swear
to despoil the rich only to give to the poor.

255
00:25:03,785 --> 00:25:09,052
To shelter the old and helpless, to protect
all women, rich or poor, Norman or Saxon.

256
00:25:09,224 --> 00:25:11,215
Swear to fight for a free England.

257
00:25:11,393 --> 00:25:15,693
To protect her loyally until the return of our
king and sovereign, Richard the Lion-Heart.

258
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:18,389
And swear to fight to the death
against our oppressors!

259
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:21,502
We do!
We do solemnly swear!

260
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,015
String him up again!

261
00:25:45,193 --> 00:25:48,594
-He'll die if we lash him again, my lord.
-Oh, he'll die, will he?

262
00:25:48,763 --> 00:25:52,290
Another one of their Saxon impudences.
They'll do anything to trick us.

263
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,196
Continue!

264
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:06,005
-Mercy, good master! Have mercy!
-Start him dancing!

265
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:22,492
This will teach you to defy Prince John!

266
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,362
Father! Father!

267
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,835
Stop!

268
00:26:42,617 --> 00:26:46,644
Five men dead. Murdered.
Sir lvor, Nigel, Baldwin, Norbert.

269
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:49,255
-You don't have to name them.
-Our men can't lay a hot iron...

270
00:26:49,424 --> 00:26:53,190
...in the eyes of a tax dodger without getting
an arrow in the throat. lt's an outrage!

271
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,727
-He's got to be stopped!
-Have you tried to stop him?

272
00:26:56,498 --> 00:26:58,022
Yes, but l couldn't find him.

273
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,603
What chance has anyone of finding him?
Every villager and woodcutter's his friend.

274
00:27:03,772 --> 00:27:06,741
Every runaway serf and Saxon thief
in the shire is joining him.

275
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:09,843
l've sent spies in the forest
to find out his hiding place...

276
00:27:10,011 --> 00:27:14,505
-...but he strikes, and gone like a flash.
-While you stay safely at home.

277
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:18,310
Do you question my valor?
Am l not personally commanding the force...

278
00:27:18,486 --> 00:27:21,114
...that goes with Sir Guy and Lady Marian
to Kenworth Castle...

279
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:24,349
...to guard the tax money he is bringing back,
with my sword and my life?

280
00:27:24,526 --> 00:27:28,053
l only hope this murderer
does come out of his hiding place.

281
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,594
You hope!

282
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:36,731
Enough of this wrangling! l'll lay this outlaw
by the heels when l get back.

283
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:09,265
Well, well.
A curtal friar, and a mighty fat one at that.

284
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:12,099
-He's the man we need. l'll enlist him.
-Be careful, Robin.

285
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,503
That's the friar of Fountain's Abbey.
He's noted--

286
00:28:14,676 --> 00:28:17,645
Yeah, that's right.
Noted for his piety.

287
00:28:17,812 --> 00:28:21,009
A humble soul, he is,
with a heart as gentle as a lamb.

288
00:28:21,182 --> 00:28:23,946
-Be easy with him, master.
-Oh, l won't harm him.

289
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,885
You stay here lest you frighten him.
Don't interfere.

290
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:31,687
But that friar's one of the most
dangerous swordsmen--

291
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:20,099
Bless my soul, a miracle!

292
00:29:27,415 --> 00:29:30,680
Robber! Thief!
Give me back my mutton joint!

293
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:38,587
lf you're a robber you'll get nothing from me.
l'm a curtal friar and vowed to poverty.

294
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,427
lf this is poverty,
l'll gladly share it with you.

295
00:29:41,596 --> 00:29:44,588
That's what you are doing.
Give me back my mutton joint!

296
00:29:44,766 --> 00:29:47,496
Not so close, my ponderous one.

297
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:49,728
-l'd have a word with you.
-Well?

298
00:29:49,904 --> 00:29:54,204
l live in the forest with good fellows who've
everything in life save spiritual guidance.

299
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,740
And no merit but one.

300
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,242
-And what's that?
-We're outlaws.

301
00:29:58,746 --> 00:30:02,341
Since we're newborn to the greenwood,
we need someone to do our christenings.

302
00:30:02,517 --> 00:30:05,486
-So we've chosen you.
-Not l.

303
00:30:05,653 --> 00:30:10,613
-They've probably all got your taking ways.
-Of course. But you'll love them, one and all.

304
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:15,291
Now, friar, let's waste no more time.
We'll take the shortcut across the stream.

305
00:30:15,763 --> 00:30:18,288
-Come.
-l'll not. l'm happy here.

306
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:20,525
You will come.

307
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:25,897
Now then, since l don't care to get my feet
wet, you'll carry me across on your back.

308
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,202
-On my back?
-Bend! You must learn obedience.

309
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:36,810
Come on, bend.

310
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:43,154
On, now!

311
00:30:47,862 --> 00:30:52,424
Come on! On! On! Faster!
l'll have a gallop from you yet.

312
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:20,686
Come now, fat one. Why don't you give up?
You can see l'm a better swordsman.

313
00:31:21,229 --> 00:31:25,689
After l let a little air into your bellows
you'll whistle a different tune.

314
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,898
By Our Lady,
you're the fairest swordsman l ever met.

315
00:31:59,067 --> 00:32:01,900
Must we go on, then?
l think we're even now, friar.

316
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,903
Even? Nay. You're still ahead of me
by half a leg of mutton.

317
00:32:05,073 --> 00:32:07,564
-So--
-No. Hold there, friar. Enough.

318
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:12,236
Come with me and l'll promise you the finest
venison pasty, and the biggest you ever ate.

319
00:32:12,413 --> 00:32:16,850
Beef, boar's head, casks of ale.

320
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,249
lf you'd said that before, you'd have saved
us both a wetting. Come along.

321
00:32:22,423 --> 00:32:23,788
-You'll join us?
-Aye.

322
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:27,655
lf only to convert you
from your thieving ways.

323
00:32:29,564 --> 00:32:31,532
You're Robin Hood, aren't you?

324
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,361
The holy henchman!

325
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,368
Hail, doubting friar!

326
00:32:38,506 --> 00:32:39,700
-Robin.
-Aye?

327
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,171
He's well named Friar Tuck.

328
00:32:41,342 --> 00:32:45,073
lt would take half the deer
in Sherwood Forest to fill that cavern.

329
00:32:45,913 --> 00:32:49,178
And twice that to fill your empty head.

330
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:56,256
-Whoa, Will!
-What news, Will?

331
00:32:56,924 --> 00:32:59,188
-l've got word--
-lt's all right. He's one of us.

332
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,090
One of us?
He looks like three of us.

333
00:33:02,263 --> 00:33:04,731
Aye.
And equal to a full dozen.

334
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:08,898
Now, now, now, now.
Friar Tuck, Will Scarlett. What's it, Will?

335
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,868
Sir Guy of Gisbourne
is stopping by the way tonight.

336
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,803
-Has he got the tax money?
-A fortune!

337
00:33:13,975 --> 00:33:16,307
-When does he enter Sherwood?
-Tomorrow.

338
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:20,379
We'll have to postpone that stuffing match
l promised, but it'll be double tomorrow!

339
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:23,779
Come! Back to camp, men!
Here, curb your appetite with that.

340
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,765
-Are you ready, men?
-Aye.

341
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:11,261
-See anything of them?
-Not yet.

342
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:13,560
ls everything ready?

343
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:17,136
They'll think they've got into
a blooming hornet's nest.

344
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:22,870
There they come.

345
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:45,897
-Hadn't we better send out flanking guards?
-What for?

346
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:48,228
Well, this is Sherwood, you know,
and Robin Hood--

347
00:34:48,402 --> 00:34:52,429
-Afraid of that gallows-face?
-Afraid? Certainly not, sir.

348
00:34:53,775 --> 00:34:56,505
But it's here that he's boldest.

349
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,305
Don't worry.
We're more than enough to take care of him.

350
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,381
Outlaws have no face to show themselves
against armed troops.

351
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,950
Are you sure?
l seem to remember--

352
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,021
Oh, yes, he jumps out of ambush at small
parties, but he wouldn't dare to attack us.

353
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:13,149
-Well, you old rooster, what do you see?
-Make ready. They're in two sections.

354
00:35:13,327 --> 00:35:15,557
-Do you see Sir Guy?
-He's leading the second.

355
00:35:15,763 --> 00:35:17,287
The treasure wagon is with him.

356
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,288
Sir Guy and the sheriff
are watering their horses.

357
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,951
-The advance guard's far ahead.
-Good. Little John!

358
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:52,622
Take your men and cut off the first section.
You surround the advance guard.

359
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,324
Personally!

360
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,470
-Ready, men?
-Aye, Robin!

361
00:35:57,638 --> 00:36:02,575
Then stand ready for the signal.
Come, Will. Come on, let's welcome Sir Guy.

362
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,034
-Look!
-The guard! Quick!

363
00:37:52,286 --> 00:37:54,015
Welcome to Sherwood, my lady.

364
00:37:56,657 --> 00:37:59,751
What, Sir Guy, no greeting from you?
Why, that's curious.

365
00:37:59,927 --> 00:38:03,727
l've often heard that you'd give me a warm
welcome if ever we met again.

366
00:38:05,232 --> 00:38:07,757
-You're permitting this insolence without--?
-Fighting?

367
00:38:07,935 --> 00:38:11,894
-l'm afraid he has no choice, my lady.
-Well, l have, you impudent rascal!

368
00:38:12,073 --> 00:38:14,735
You're not going to harm my lamb,
my honeysuckle.

369
00:38:14,909 --> 00:38:16,206
Be still, Bess.

370
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,039
We've nothing but peaceful intentions.
Have we, men?

371
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,943
We only want to stroke his pretty neck.

372
00:38:22,116 --> 00:38:25,210
-We won't harm him much.
-You see?

373
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,513
Well, let's away.

374
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,405
Don't bother to mark the way.
lt'll take keener men than you've got...

375
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,478
-...to find our camp again.
-You'll hang for this, all of you.

376
00:38:52,646 --> 00:38:55,672
A small price to pay for the company
of such a charming lady.

377
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:59,445
What can a Saxon hedge-robber
know of charm? Or ladies?

378
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,815
-She means you.
-Me? A hedge-robber?

379
00:39:01,989 --> 00:39:05,049
You must tell me more about myself.
You may have been misinformed.

380
00:39:05,226 --> 00:39:08,389
Perhaps, but l don't find it interesting
enough to bother about.

381
00:39:10,898 --> 00:39:13,366
You just harm one hair
of my lady's head...

382
00:39:13,534 --> 00:39:18,767
...and that ugly face of yours will walk
about with no neck under it. Now, mind!

383
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,806
-What are you staring at?
-l ain't never been out walking...

384
00:39:21,976 --> 00:39:24,035
-...with a female before.
-What female?

385
00:39:24,211 --> 00:39:28,011
-You.
-Well, of all the impudence!

386
00:39:28,249 --> 00:39:30,945
l suppose you say that to all women
that tickle your fancy.

387
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,552
l've never tickled
a woman's fancy before.

388
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:35,689
No, l've never had a sweetheart.

389
00:39:36,524 --> 00:39:41,393
Do you mean to say you never had one single
sweetheart in all your life?

390
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,121
You don't know what you missed,
my lad.

391
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,597
l've had the bands on five times.

392
00:40:08,055 --> 00:40:10,853
My lord! Your robes for the feast.
Hurry up, put them on.

393
00:40:11,025 --> 00:40:13,721
-l won't!
-You will!

394
00:40:13,894 --> 00:40:15,225
l will! l will!

395
00:40:24,905 --> 00:40:26,372
To them, this is heaven.

396
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:31,375
Silks for rags, kindness instead of riches,
limitless food instead of hunger.

397
00:40:31,545 --> 00:40:34,412
-Why, they're actually happy.
-Are they?

398
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:37,745
Aren't you even a little pleased
to see them enjoying themselves?

399
00:40:37,918 --> 00:40:39,852
l think it's revolting.

400
00:40:41,122 --> 00:40:45,650
Your life's been very sheltered, hasn't it,
my lady? Too sheltered, perhaps.

401
00:40:45,826 --> 00:40:51,492
But if you could know these people as l know
them. Their patience, loyalty, goodness.

402
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:55,398
Friar Tuck!
These should fit Sir Guy.

403
00:41:01,675 --> 00:41:06,203
Me lord. Here is your raiment
for the banquet.

404
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,679
When you've done with them,
give them to Prince John.

405
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:14,250
To the tables, everybody,
and stuff yourselves!

406
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:21,985
May l serve you, my lady?

407
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:24,563
l'm afraid the company
has spoiled my appetite.

408
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:28,099
Misfortune.
Now, mine is excellent.

409
00:41:45,286 --> 00:41:48,312
-A little mutton, my lady?
-l said l'm not hungry.

410
00:41:48,489 --> 00:41:50,286
Why, so you did. l'd forgotten.

411
00:41:50,457 --> 00:41:54,826
Well, you will let me know
if you regain your appetite, won't you?

412
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:31,259
Friends! Friends!

413
00:42:31,432 --> 00:42:35,232
l'd supposed, with you, that this Sir Guy
of Gisbourne was a scurvy fellow...

414
00:42:35,402 --> 00:42:37,734
...and a bitter enemy of ours.
And yet, look!

415
00:42:37,905 --> 00:42:39,964
He provides us with this tasty supper.

416
00:42:44,712 --> 00:42:47,840
And is this the end of his beneficence?
Why, no!

417
00:42:48,015 --> 00:42:53,351
For in his train today he's brought us half
a score of boxes full of jewels and silks...

418
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,719
...and more, about 30,000 golden marks
wrested from the northern shires.

419
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,859
-You wouldn't dare.
-Sit down!

420
00:43:04,131 --> 00:43:09,000
Some of you might think our host intended
this treasure for the coffers of Prince John...

421
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:12,070
...instead of to ransom the king.
And you would be right.

422
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:14,298
But a strange thing happened.

423
00:43:14,475 --> 00:43:20,141
A change of heart overtook him in the forest,
and there it is, safe and sound!

424
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:28,179
-You speak of loyalty.
-Yes. Why not?

425
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:32,052
l suppose you and your cutthroats
intend to send this treasure to Richard?

426
00:43:32,226 --> 00:43:35,161
You wouldn't dream
of keeping it yourselves.

427
00:43:36,797 --> 00:43:41,234
Friends! What shall we do with this treasure?
Divide it amongst ourselves?

428
00:43:41,402 --> 00:43:43,996
-Hold it for Richard!
-lt belongs to the king!

429
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,577
-Convinced?
-l may have been hasty....

430
00:43:57,251 --> 00:44:02,746
But why you, a knight, should live here
like an animal, robbing, killing, outlawed...?

431
00:44:02,923 --> 00:44:05,687
Are you really interested in learning
why l turned outlaw?

432
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,418
Or are you afraid of the truth?
Or of me, perhaps?

433
00:44:08,929 --> 00:44:14,128
-l'm afraid of nothing. Least of all of you.
-Good. Then come with me.

434
00:44:14,301 --> 00:44:16,394
Oh, so you are afraid.

435
00:44:29,149 --> 00:44:31,208
-Well, men.
-Hi!

436
00:44:44,732 --> 00:44:49,328
Hardly an inspiring sight
for such pretty eyes as yours, l'm sure.

437
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:52,803
But these poor devils
have all had their homes burned.

438
00:44:52,973 --> 00:44:56,272
Their families beaten and starved to death
by your tax gatherers.

439
00:44:56,443 --> 00:45:00,038
-Bless you, Robin. We'll never forget you.
-Our humble thanks, master.

440
00:45:00,214 --> 00:45:03,581
-May we be worthy, Robin.
-You are, mother, you are.

441
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:06,481
-Have you eaten well, friend?
-Yes, thank you, Robin Hood.

442
00:45:06,653 --> 00:45:09,053
We humbly thank you, master.

443
00:45:12,426 --> 00:45:17,625
l'm sorry to have to show you that. But once
these poor people were happy and contented.

444
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,494
Just simple villagers
who never harmed a soul.

445
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:26,697
And now.... Tortured, eyes put out,
tongues slit, ears hacked off.

446
00:45:27,674 --> 00:45:32,509
They come to me for protection
against your Norman friends.

447
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,911
But you've taken Norman lives.

448
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:39,052
Yes, those that deserved it.
The cruel and unjust.

449
00:45:39,686 --> 00:45:41,654
You're a strange man.

450
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:45,622
Strange? Because l can feel for beaten,
helpless people?

451
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:48,785
No, you're strange because you want
to do something about it.

452
00:45:48,962 --> 00:45:53,695
You're willing to defy Sir Guy, even Prince
John himself. To risk your own life.

453
00:45:53,867 --> 00:45:58,099
-And one of those men was a Norman.
-Norman or Saxon. What's that matter?

454
00:45:58,272 --> 00:46:02,675
-lt's injustice l hate, not the Normans.
-But it's lost you your rank, your lands.

455
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:07,007
lt's made you a hunted outlaw, when
you might have lived in comfort and security.

456
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,012
What's your reward for all this?

457
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:14,349
Reward?
You just don't understand, do you?

458
00:46:15,556 --> 00:46:16,887
l'm sorry.

459
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:21,420
l do begin to see a little now.

460
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:27,065
lf you do, then that's reward enough.

461
00:46:47,421 --> 00:46:51,016
Now that you've robbed us and had your fill
of insulting us, we wish to leave.

462
00:46:51,191 --> 00:46:53,352
-Come, Lady Marian.
-My men will escort my lady.

463
00:46:53,527 --> 00:46:57,429
But before you take leave, it might be well
if you thanked her for saving your life.

464
00:46:57,598 --> 00:46:58,860
My life?

465
00:46:59,032 --> 00:47:03,264
Do you think you would have left this forest
alive if it hadn't been for her presence here?

466
00:47:04,304 --> 00:47:05,601
-Peter! Harold!
-Yes, master?

467
00:47:05,772 --> 00:47:10,402
Take six men and guide our loyal host and
his nervous friend to the Nottingham Road.

468
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:13,068
But our horses, our clothes.

469
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,841
You'll return to Nottingham
as you are, on foot.

470
00:47:16,016 --> 00:47:19,747
This, Sir Guy, will at least be a lesson to you
in humility, if not in mercy.

471
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,855
-Your people will be returned tomorrow.
-But the lady Marian.

472
00:47:23,023 --> 00:47:25,992
You'd best be started
before l have a change of mind.

473
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,492
l think we'd better go.

474
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,700
Now, my lady.

475
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,673
Friar Tuck! Little John!

476
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,080
Take the lady
to the Abbey of the Black Canons...

477
00:47:49,249 --> 00:47:52,343
...so tomorrow the bishop
can give her escort the rest of the way.

478
00:47:52,519 --> 00:47:56,387
-May l go too?
-With your permission, my lady?

479
00:48:08,669 --> 00:48:10,637
Goodbye, my lady.

480
00:48:11,004 --> 00:48:12,596
Goodbye.

481
00:48:30,787 --> 00:48:33,415
-He took everything you had collected?
-Every silver penny.

482
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:36,252
And you two nincompoops sat there
and let him do it.

483
00:48:36,426 --> 00:48:41,227
-Oh, we resisted as well as we could.
-Where are your wounds? Your bruises?

484
00:48:41,398 --> 00:48:43,992
-And where are your men?
-What did Your Highness expect?

485
00:48:44,167 --> 00:48:47,432
With the Lady Marian in our company
and Locksley's men outnumbering us.

486
00:48:47,604 --> 00:48:50,164
And not an arrow wound to divide
among them, l suppose.

487
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:53,537
And more than 30,000 marks
in the hands of that wolf's head.

488
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:56,440
That fellow's got to be taken.
Understand?

489
00:48:56,613 --> 00:48:59,013
And how does Your Highness suggest
that he be taken?

490
00:48:59,182 --> 00:49:03,175
-lf l may be so bold as to inquire?
-Mind your words, Gisbourne.

491
00:49:03,353 --> 00:49:06,720
You're fortunate not to be paying
for this with your head.

492
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:11,384
Your Highness, sir, l could muster an army
and surround Sherwood.

493
00:49:11,928 --> 00:49:14,192
-You couldn't capture him...
-You mind your words.

494
00:49:14,364 --> 00:49:17,026
...if he sat in your lap
shooting arrows at a crow.

495
00:49:17,234 --> 00:49:18,462
Arrows!

496
00:49:18,635 --> 00:49:22,799
-He said shooting arrows at a crow.
-Take that silly looking bonnet off.

497
00:49:22,973 --> 00:49:26,636
That stirs something in my mind.
Perhaps we can't take him by force.

498
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:29,870
He's too well protected.
Knows Sherwood's hidden paths well. But--

499
00:49:30,046 --> 00:49:31,604
-But what?
-We'll outwit him.

500
00:49:31,781 --> 00:49:33,715
We'll hold an archery tournament!

501
00:49:33,883 --> 00:49:35,214
Archery tour--

502
00:49:35,385 --> 00:49:39,719
And have him fly in on the end of one
of his own arrows? That's marvelous.

503
00:49:39,889 --> 00:49:42,790
He's the finest archer in the North.
Think he'd forgo shooting...

504
00:49:42,959 --> 00:49:46,622
...against the archers of all England?
We'll give a prize. Say, a golden arrow.

505
00:49:46,796 --> 00:49:49,424
And ask him to risk his neck for that?

506
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:54,502
That won't be the only bait, with
the Lady Marian presenting the arrow herself.

507
00:49:55,305 --> 00:49:56,533
What do you mean?

508
00:49:56,706 --> 00:49:59,834
When they came out of the forest,
she seemed very friendly.

509
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:02,604
And didn't you notice
how his eyes never left her?

510
00:50:02,779 --> 00:50:04,576
-Yes, yes, l noticed.
-Well, then!

511
00:50:04,748 --> 00:50:08,013
-Well, then, how do we get word to him?
-Get word to Robin...

512
00:50:08,184 --> 00:50:10,744
...who has an eye in every bush
and ears in every wall?

513
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,218
But even if he comes,
won't he be disguised?

514
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:17,383
Whether he be dressed as priest, beggar,
knight, palmer, what disguise can conceal...

515
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,084
...the finest archer in England?

516
00:50:19,262 --> 00:50:22,254
The man who wins the golden arrow
will be Robin Hood.

517
00:50:22,432 --> 00:50:25,060
Will you take that bonnet off?

518
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:15,483
l hope our little golden hook
will catch the fish.

519
00:51:15,652 --> 00:51:17,813
-You hope?
-Oh, it will if he's here.

520
00:51:17,987 --> 00:51:22,390
lf he's not, we'll stick your head
upon the target and shoot at that.

521
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,322
-Are your men sure of their orders?
-Yes.

522
00:51:24,494 --> 00:51:28,123
They're stationed all around the field.
Even a worm couldn't get through.

523
00:51:28,298 --> 00:51:29,925
You talk as if this were a trap.

524
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:36,061
Oh, no, my dear. Just a precaution in case
the Saxons create a disturbance.

525
00:51:40,043 --> 00:51:46,380
By orders of His Highness Prince John, the
champions of Sir Guy and the knights...

526
00:51:46,549 --> 00:51:51,009
...will be limited to three flights of arrows
for the eliminations.

527
00:51:51,187 --> 00:51:55,351
The winning team will meet all comers.

528
00:52:16,513 --> 00:52:19,346
-You know it's a trap.
-A golden arrow, from the lady herself.

529
00:52:19,516 --> 00:52:22,974
-They've cooked up this thing to take you.
-Well, what of it?

530
00:52:23,153 --> 00:52:26,179
-You know what'll happen if they do.
-Where's your sporting blood?

531
00:52:26,356 --> 00:52:29,291
Sir Guy accepted our invitation.
We'd be rude not to accept his.

532
00:52:29,459 --> 00:52:34,487
-lt'd be ruder to get your neck stretched.
-There, my band getting fat and overfed.

533
00:52:34,664 --> 00:52:36,791
Where's your love of fights,
risk, adventure?

534
00:52:36,966 --> 00:52:41,300
Well, since our friend seems to have gone
a little mad, l'll have to see him through.

535
00:52:41,471 --> 00:52:43,405
We'll have to see him through.

536
00:52:59,556 --> 00:53:01,319
Prepare final flight.

537
00:53:03,259 --> 00:53:07,252
Does my lady find it interesting?
Lady Marian?

538
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:09,830
-Oh, l'm sorry.
-l asked if you found it interesting.

539
00:53:09,999 --> 00:53:13,730
Yes, very.
They're splendid archers.

540
00:53:13,903 --> 00:53:16,269
You'll find it much more
interesting later on.

541
00:53:22,078 --> 00:53:26,606
The winning team will compete
as individuals.

542
00:53:26,783 --> 00:53:29,809
Captain Phillip of Arras.

543
00:53:29,986 --> 00:53:34,616
Elwyn the Welshman.
Matt of Sleaford.

544
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:37,919
They now challenge all comers.

545
00:53:38,094 --> 00:53:41,393
The men who'd shoot against that lot
have to have the eyes of a falcon.

546
00:53:41,564 --> 00:53:44,192
They're far too good for me.
l'm not shooting today.

547
00:54:54,337 --> 00:54:57,738
Remaining archers will use
center target.

548
00:55:10,286 --> 00:55:12,015
Matt of Sleaford, out!

549
00:55:12,188 --> 00:55:14,952
Elwyn the Welshman, out!

550
00:55:22,365 --> 00:55:24,230
-The tall tinker.
-Now is the time.

551
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,927
Not so hasty, Sir Guy. l'm enjoying myself.
Let them finish the match.

552
00:55:28,104 --> 00:55:31,267
-But he could--
-Have your men close in if you wish.

553
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,677
Look.

554
00:55:38,848 --> 00:55:41,248
Yeah, they're closing in.
l hope Robin sees them.

555
00:55:52,662 --> 00:55:55,597
l must commend Your Highness
for the subtlety of your scheme.

556
00:56:09,812 --> 00:56:16,012
Very good. Would you say you'd seen
that tall fellow before?

557
00:56:16,185 --> 00:56:19,416
And if l had, what interest
could a tinker have for me?

558
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:21,784
Phillip of Arras shoots next.

559
00:56:25,495 --> 00:56:28,293
Tie!
You will be allowed another flight.

560
00:56:28,464 --> 00:56:33,492
Target's a deal too close. Can we have
it removed to a fit distance to shoot at?

561
00:56:35,605 --> 00:56:37,300
Another 20 paces!

562
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:45,570
lf your archer captain wins at that distance,
l'll give you 1 000 gold marks for him.

563
00:56:45,748 --> 00:56:48,808
Win or lose, l'll give him
to Your Highness for a favor.

564
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:52,253
Provided you let me deal
with this wolf's head in my own way.

565
00:56:52,422 --> 00:56:56,620
Done. l'm leaving for Norwich immediately
after the tournament anyway...

566
00:56:56,793 --> 00:56:58,988
...so you may do what you please
with him.

567
00:57:03,299 --> 00:57:06,462
Why, he can't win now.
No living man could beat that shot.

568
00:57:06,636 --> 00:57:09,799
l'll wager 1 00 marks on Phillip of Arras!

569
00:57:16,979 --> 00:57:18,674
He split Phillip's arrow.

570
00:57:19,782 --> 00:57:22,114
The tinker wins! He wins!

571
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:44,829
-What is your name, archer?
-Godfrey of Sherwood, Your Highness.

572
00:57:45,007 --> 00:57:48,704
How is it that a tinker learned so well
the use of arms?

573
00:57:48,878 --> 00:57:54,783
Even a peaceful tinker must protect himself
these days from treachery and other things.

574
00:57:54,951 --> 00:57:57,784
lt's earned you more
than you bargained for today.

575
00:57:58,888 --> 00:58:01,220
l pronounce you champion archer
of England.

576
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:06,453
And from the gracious hand of Lady Marian
Fitzwalter, you'll receive your reward.

577
00:58:10,466 --> 00:58:12,024
Advance.

578
00:58:22,445 --> 00:58:26,541
l.... Here is your prize, sir archer.

579
00:58:26,716 --> 00:58:31,210
lt's indeed an honor to receive it
from the hands of so beautiful a lady.

580
00:58:31,754 --> 00:58:36,054
-How is it that you didn't use a black arrow?
-That's my court of last resort, Sir Guy.

581
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:39,717
-lts verdict is always final.
-Arrest this man!

582
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:27,934
That's a good idea.

583
00:59:30,746 --> 00:59:32,475
You're a very rash young man.

584
00:59:32,648 --> 00:59:36,482
And l'm sorry l can't be in Nottingham
to see what Gisbourne has in store for you.

585
00:59:36,652 --> 00:59:39,644
-lt'll be something special, l'm sure.
-l'm sure.

586
00:59:39,822 --> 00:59:42,154
Sorry l underestimated you.
Next time perhaps--

587
00:59:42,325 --> 00:59:44,885
There'll be no next time.
Take him away!

588
01:00:15,157 --> 01:00:19,321
''Robin of Locksley.
Known to some as the outlaw Robin Hood.

589
01:00:19,495 --> 01:00:22,726
After trial, in which you did not produce
one witness in your behalf...

590
01:00:22,899 --> 01:00:25,891
...you've been found guilty of outlawry,
theft, murder, abduction...

591
01:00:26,068 --> 01:00:30,232
...false pretenses, contempt of the Crown,
poaching in royal forests and high treason.''

592
01:00:30,406 --> 01:00:32,340
Haven't you forgotten
a count or two?

593
01:00:32,808 --> 01:00:36,141
Surely it's a crime under the noble
Prince John to love one's country.

594
01:00:36,312 --> 01:00:39,008
To protect serfs from injustice
and be loyal to one's king.

595
01:00:39,515 --> 01:00:44,214
lf l could add anything to the charges
against you, l would most gladly do so.

596
01:00:44,387 --> 01:00:47,948
''lt is the sentence of this tribunal,
on the morrow at high noon you be taken...

597
01:00:48,124 --> 01:00:52,390
...to the square in Nottingham and there
hanged by the neck until you are dead.''

598
01:00:54,463 --> 01:00:58,263
There may be some who will regret
that a man of your peculiar talents...

599
01:00:58,434 --> 01:01:00,698
...should be cut off so early in life.
But personally--

600
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:04,397
You think the sentence extremely lenient.
Thank you.

601
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,170
What's troubling you, my lady?
ls it the outlaw?

602
01:02:15,244 --> 01:02:19,840
Yes. l hate to see a human
being trapped....

603
01:02:20,316 --> 01:02:23,843
Bess, you know where his men
may be found, don't you?

604
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:26,454
-Why, my lady, how should l know?
-Don't put me off.

605
01:02:26,622 --> 01:02:29,591
That little man who liked you.
You've been seeing him?

606
01:02:29,759 --> 01:02:31,522
-Yes, my lady.
-Tell me where.

607
01:02:31,694 --> 01:02:34,026
-Do you want to send a message?
-To his men, yes.

608
01:02:34,196 --> 01:02:37,461
Well, my lady, l have had a nip of ale
of a night, just now and again...

609
01:02:37,633 --> 01:02:41,399
...at a place in the town and l won't deny
as some of the others were there.

610
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:45,597
Where was it?
Oh, Bess, please tell me!

611
01:02:46,075 --> 01:02:51,570
lt was a tavern, my lady.
The Saracen's Head in Pilgrim Court.

612
01:02:51,747 --> 01:02:54,272
-The landlord's name is Humility Prin.
-Humility Prin.

613
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:57,180
-Knock at the door and say, ''A Locksley.''
-''A Locksley.''

614
01:02:57,353 --> 01:02:59,981
-Yes, but--
-Get me a cloak, quickly!

615
01:03:00,156 --> 01:03:02,920
Yes, madame.
Oh, dear....

616
01:03:06,829 --> 01:03:10,356
-But there must be some way--
-lf we had to, couldn't we storm the place?

617
01:03:10,533 --> 01:03:13,661
Why, you'd need an army
with a battering ram to even dent it.

618
01:03:13,836 --> 01:03:15,861
Aye, he'll be hanged for sure.

619
01:03:16,038 --> 01:03:18,529
Maybe Little John's right.
Perhaps we should--

620
01:03:22,211 --> 01:03:23,803
A Locksley.

621
01:03:35,858 --> 01:03:38,520
-What is it, Prin?
-A lady, sir. The Lady Marian.

622
01:03:38,694 --> 01:03:42,824
-What?
-lt's a trap, Will. Watch those windows.

623
01:03:42,998 --> 01:03:44,989
She has the password, all right.

624
01:03:45,167 --> 01:03:47,260
-ls she alone?
-Yes, sir.

625
01:03:47,436 --> 01:03:49,063
Fetch her in.

626
01:04:04,353 --> 01:04:07,481
-What do you want, my lady?
-l want to help him.

627
01:04:07,656 --> 01:04:11,422
-How did you find us here?
-Never mind that now.

628
01:04:12,962 --> 01:04:15,931
Please don't stand there staring.
Tell me what l can do.

629
01:04:16,098 --> 01:04:19,795
-Don't trust her. lt's a Norman trick.
-Would l come here alone if it were a trap?

630
01:04:19,969 --> 01:04:24,770
What's to prevent your killing me if--? ls
there no one here with sense enough to see?

631
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:26,498
One moment.

632
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:31,437
We have to make sure, my child.
You're a good daughter of the church?

633
01:04:32,715 --> 01:04:35,309
You swear by Our Lady
that you want to help Robin?

634
01:04:35,484 --> 01:04:37,111
l swear, good Father.

635
01:04:37,553 --> 01:04:39,077
-Have you thought of a way?
-Yes.

636
01:04:39,255 --> 01:04:42,486
-Can you get us in the castle?
-That's no good. He's heavily guarded.

637
01:04:42,658 --> 01:04:44,523
But l thought of another way.
Listen.

638
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:19,117
-This is a rare treat, isn't it, my lady?
-Yes, isn't it?

639
01:05:19,295 --> 01:05:22,025
With Locksley out of the way,
we'll stamp out the rest.

640
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:26,697
Won't it be a pleasant surprise
for Prince John when he returns?

641
01:05:28,337 --> 01:05:32,637
And to think that l was once foolish enough
to believe that you rather liked him.

642
01:05:32,908 --> 01:05:35,035
Why, your hand is trembling.

643
01:06:14,883 --> 01:06:17,113
Take him to the gallows.

644
01:06:25,694 --> 01:06:26,956
Take him up there.

645
01:07:01,764 --> 01:07:05,393
He'll not be so insolent
when they've stretched his neck.

646
01:07:06,335 --> 01:07:08,132
Get ready.

647
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:25,180
Stop him!

648
01:07:55,351 --> 01:07:57,319
Stop! Guards!

649
01:08:09,832 --> 01:08:11,663
Friar Tuck! Much!

650
01:08:11,834 --> 01:08:14,132
-Here we are, sir!
-Here we are, safe and sound!

651
01:08:14,303 --> 01:08:15,895
Back to camp!

652
01:08:37,926 --> 01:08:40,224
Robin! Where are you?

653
01:08:41,397 --> 01:08:43,957
Here l am. Stand by!

654
01:09:28,944 --> 01:09:31,208
He is different from anyone l've ever known.

655
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:36,647
He's, well, he's brave and he's reckless,
and yet he's gentle and kind.

656
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:38,650
He's not brutal like....

657
01:09:38,821 --> 01:09:43,190
Tell me, when you are in love, is it...

658
01:09:43,358 --> 01:09:46,191
...well, is it hard to think of anybody
but one person?

659
01:09:46,361 --> 01:09:49,194
Yes, indeed, and sometimes
there's a bit of trouble sleeping.

660
01:09:49,364 --> 01:09:52,026
l know, but it's a nice kind of not sleeping.

661
01:09:52,201 --> 01:09:54,294
Yes, and it affects your appetite too.

662
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:58,668
Not that l've noticed it's done that to you,
except when he was waiting to be hanged.

663
01:09:58,841 --> 01:10:01,139
Does it make you want
to be with him all the time?

664
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:05,576
Yes. And when he's with you,
your legs are weak as water.

665
01:10:05,747 --> 01:10:10,081
Tell me, my lady, when he looks at you,
do you feel a kind of prickly feeling...

666
01:10:10,252 --> 01:10:14,348
...like goosy pimples running
all up and down your spine?

667
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:17,420
-Then there's not a doubt of it.
-Doubt of what?

668
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:19,493
That you're in love!

669
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:23,323
What do you want?

670
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:25,428
Robin!

671
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:29,367
-l must say. l must say!
-Keep quiet, Bess.

672
01:10:29,538 --> 01:10:31,529
Are you completely mad?

673
01:10:31,707 --> 01:10:33,800
-Why did you come here?
-To see you.

674
01:10:33,976 --> 01:10:35,273
But don't you realize that--?

675
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:38,277
My men told me what you did for me,
so l've come to thank you.

676
01:10:38,447 --> 01:10:42,008
And after what l couldn't help overhearing
about that prickly feeling...

677
01:10:42,184 --> 01:10:43,549
...l'm very glad l did come.

678
01:10:43,719 --> 01:10:47,052
That was a game.
Now, you've got to go at once!

679
01:10:47,222 --> 01:10:49,952
A game?
Well, couldn't l join in?

680
01:10:50,492 --> 01:10:55,589
Of course, l probably wouldn't be
as good at it as this pretty young girl.

681
01:10:56,298 --> 01:10:57,697
But l could do my best.

682
01:10:57,866 --> 01:10:59,197
Bess, will you leave us?

683
01:11:00,869 --> 01:11:02,427
Please!

684
01:11:13,549 --> 01:11:16,040
Now, let's see, where does this game begin?

685
01:11:16,218 --> 01:11:20,211
Oh, l know. lt's simple.
We'll start where you're in love with me.

686
01:11:20,389 --> 01:11:24,189
You are, aren't you?
Because l am with you, terribly.

687
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:27,021
That's why l came.
l had to see you again.

688
01:11:27,195 --> 01:11:29,561
You must go at once.
And l don't love you.

689
01:11:29,731 --> 01:11:33,724
-Oh! Are you sure?
-Yes.

690
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:37,300
Very well then, l'll go.

691
01:11:39,708 --> 01:11:44,236
You know, this is rather unfriendly of you,
exposing me to my enemies like this.

692
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:50,247
Now, let me see. There's a fat old captain
of the guard down there with bow legs.

693
01:11:50,419 --> 01:11:52,614
lf l drop on him that'll bend them out worse.

694
01:11:52,788 --> 01:11:55,450
An archer! He's too thin.
l might miss him altogether.

695
01:11:55,624 --> 01:11:57,421
-Robin!
-The very thing.

696
01:11:57,593 --> 01:12:00,528
Five men-at-arms in a group.
They'll break the fall beautifully.

697
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:02,220
-Goodbye, my lady!
-Robin!

698
01:12:02,397 --> 01:12:03,887
-Yes?
-Please.

699
01:12:04,066 --> 01:12:05,829
Then you do love me? Don't you?

700
01:12:06,001 --> 01:12:07,969
-Don't you?
-You know l do.

701
01:12:08,136 --> 01:12:10,161
Well, that's different.

702
01:12:23,685 --> 01:12:26,153
-Do you know you're very impudent?
-Me?

703
01:12:26,321 --> 01:12:27,310
You are!

704
01:12:27,489 --> 01:12:31,084
When my guardian, King Richard,
finds out about your being in love with me--

705
01:12:31,259 --> 01:12:33,591
-l know, he'll make me court jester.
-He won't!

706
01:12:33,762 --> 01:12:35,855
He'll stick your funny head on London Gate.

707
01:12:36,031 --> 01:12:38,727
And a fine decoration it will be,
my bold Norman beauty.

708
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,800
-l'm not bold.
-Well, you're Norman.

709
01:12:40,969 --> 01:12:44,871
Well, l don't hold that against you.
And you are a beauty.

710
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,474
-You're the most beautiful--
-You're leaving at once.

711
01:12:47,643 --> 01:12:50,510
Please, darling, every minute
you're here you're in danger.

712
01:12:50,679 --> 01:12:51,873
l'll go.

713
01:12:52,047 --> 01:12:56,711
-Marian, will you come with me?
-To Sherwood?

714
01:12:56,885 --> 01:13:01,481
l've nothing to offer you but a life of
hardship and danger, but we'd be together.

715
01:13:01,657 --> 01:13:04,888
-But, Robin, dear--
-l know. lt's asking a lot, but who knows...

716
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:10,293
...how long it'll be before Richard returns.
Friar Tuck could marry us. Will you?

717
01:13:10,465 --> 01:13:12,729
Because l love you, Robin, l'd come.

718
01:13:12,901 --> 01:13:15,461
Even the danger would mean nothing
if you were with me.

719
01:13:15,637 --> 01:13:16,797
Then you will?

720
01:13:16,972 --> 01:13:20,772
No. Listen to me, darling.
You remember that day in Sherwood Forest?

721
01:13:20,942 --> 01:13:24,537
l realized then for the first time
that what you were doing was right...

722
01:13:24,713 --> 01:13:25,975
...and that we were wrong.

723
01:13:26,148 --> 01:13:27,410
No, let me finish.

724
01:13:27,582 --> 01:13:30,278
You taught me England
is bigger than Normans and Saxons...

725
01:13:30,452 --> 01:13:32,079
...fighting and hating each other.

726
01:13:32,254 --> 01:13:35,018
That it belongs to all of us,
to live peacefully together...

727
01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:37,055
...loyal only to Richard and to England.

728
01:13:37,225 --> 01:13:39,022
But, darling, you could help.

729
01:13:39,194 --> 01:13:42,061
l could help much more
by watching for treachery here...

730
01:13:42,230 --> 01:13:45,893
...and leaving you free to protect
Richard's people until he returns.

731
01:13:46,068 --> 01:13:49,504
Now do you see why
you have to go back to your men alone?

732
01:14:09,324 --> 01:14:12,259
Go now, quickly, dearest.

733
01:14:13,161 --> 01:14:16,130
-Goodbye, darling.
-Goodbye.

734
01:14:32,447 --> 01:14:35,507
-Goodbye, my love.
-Goodbye.

735
01:15:05,647 --> 01:15:09,947
-You gentlemen have traveled far?
-Yes, quite a distance.

736
01:15:10,118 --> 01:15:13,110
l'm sorry l can't give you better food.

737
01:15:14,623 --> 01:15:18,320
-There is little left to us these days.
-This will be enough.

738
01:15:18,493 --> 01:15:21,155
The inn at Luton was well supplied.
How is that?

739
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:24,161
That's a Norman inn.

740
01:15:28,737 --> 01:15:31,968
But it's an outrage!
l'll complain to Prince John.

741
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:36,270
l'll have this rascal's ears, no matter how.
Dares to rob me!

742
01:15:36,444 --> 01:15:38,412
Strip my person of jewels!

743
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:42,607
What's this country coming to when a high
churchman can't travel the forest in safety?

744
01:15:42,784 --> 01:15:45,947
-Who's he?
-The Bishop of the Black Canons.

745
01:15:46,121 --> 01:15:49,522
-Do you wish to go on after dinner?
-No. We can't reach the abbey tonight.

746
01:15:49,691 --> 01:15:51,921
-l'll stay. Tend to the horses.
-Yes, Your Grace.

747
01:15:52,093 --> 01:15:54,186
-Bring food to us!
-Yes, Your Grace, at once!

748
01:15:54,362 --> 01:15:57,991
lt's no longer safe to journey anywhere.
Robbers at every turn of the road.

749
01:15:58,166 --> 01:16:00,999
-What happened, Your Grace?
-l told you! We've been robbed.

750
01:16:01,169 --> 01:16:04,605
Not a chance to defend ourselves.
They burst on us from ambush.

751
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:07,139
-Who did?
-Why, Robin Hood, of course.

752
01:16:07,309 --> 01:16:09,106
There's no other with impudence enough.

753
01:16:09,277 --> 01:16:11,177
Robin Hood again, sire.

754
01:16:13,915 --> 01:16:17,476
-You've heard of him, then?
-Oh, he seems well known hereabouts.

755
01:16:17,652 --> 01:16:23,591
-Oh, then you're strange to this shire?
-More or less.

756
01:16:23,758 --> 01:16:25,658
What might be your names, gentlemen?

757
01:16:25,827 --> 01:16:28,557
They're hardly important enough
to deserve your interest.

758
01:16:28,730 --> 01:16:31,722
-Landlord, where's our ale?
-Coming, sirs.

759
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,993
Will you gentlemen
be remaining here tonight?

760
01:16:34,169 --> 01:16:37,570
We hadn't decided, Your Grace.
What would you advise?

761
01:16:37,739 --> 01:16:41,903
Well, there's so much danger on the road,
you'd be far safer here.

762
01:16:42,077 --> 01:16:45,877
We will then, since we'll have
the added pleasure of your company.

763
01:16:46,047 --> 01:16:51,178
Well, l should really like to stay, but l
recollected some urgent affairs at my abbey.

764
01:16:51,353 --> 01:16:55,449
Some other time, or perhaps you would break
your journey and sup with me tomorrow.

765
01:16:55,624 --> 01:16:56,750
Your Grace is too kind.

766
01:16:56,925 --> 01:17:00,486
Then l bid you good evening, gentlemen,
and God speed you in the morning.

767
01:17:00,662 --> 01:17:02,596
Thank you. Good night.

768
01:17:10,372 --> 01:17:11,999
The window!

769
01:17:16,111 --> 01:17:18,477
Are there beds prepared, landlord?

770
01:17:18,647 --> 01:17:22,344
Let's to sleep, then. l'm tired.

771
01:17:26,721 --> 01:17:30,088
-l'm afraid he suspects, sire.
-l fear so.

772
01:17:30,258 --> 01:17:34,627
His Grace is a Norman. Did you see the fear
on the landlord's face when he came in?

773
01:17:34,796 --> 01:17:37,765
l've seen it in the faces
of thousands since we returned.

774
01:17:37,933 --> 01:17:39,924
l ought never to have left England.

775
01:17:40,101 --> 01:17:42,160
l noticed when Robin Hood's
name is mentioned--

776
01:17:42,337 --> 01:17:44,271
The mysterious outlaw
whom we have sought.

777
01:17:44,439 --> 01:17:48,739
ln vain. However, the bishop
didn't have any difficulty meeting him.

778
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:50,309
Which gives me an idea.

779
01:17:51,813 --> 01:17:54,213
-And you're sure it was Richard?
-No doubt of it.

780
01:17:54,382 --> 01:17:56,407
How like my dear brother this is!

781
01:17:56,584 --> 01:17:59,951
He couldn't rot in Durnstein
like any decent man.

782
01:18:01,556 --> 01:18:03,751
-But Richard has no army.
-No, Your Highness.

783
01:18:03,925 --> 01:18:07,793
-lf he had, we should have heard of it.
-lf my brother happened to be killed--

784
01:18:07,963 --> 01:18:11,126
-England would have a new king.
-That would be murder! l'll have no part--

785
01:18:11,299 --> 01:18:15,235
You'll do as you're told!
That's very simple. Keep your mouth closed.

786
01:18:15,403 --> 01:18:16,734
Your Highness, l beg of you!

787
01:18:16,905 --> 01:18:20,807
How long will you retain your abbey
if Richard survives to find out...

788
01:18:20,976 --> 01:18:23,968
...what you've been up to
these years he's been away?

789
01:18:27,949 --> 01:18:30,713
Go on, Gisbourne. Who's to...?

790
01:18:30,885 --> 01:18:33,786
Dickon was a knight before
your brother hacked off his spurs...

791
01:18:33,955 --> 01:18:35,320
...over some little mischance.

792
01:18:35,490 --> 01:18:39,358
There's nothing he wouldn't do for a king
who'd restore him to rank.

793
01:18:41,863 --> 01:18:45,663
-You don't love my brother, l hear.
-l have little reason to, Your Highness.

794
01:18:45,834 --> 01:18:48,632
-You know this tavern?
-Yes.

795
01:18:48,803 --> 01:18:53,797
-lf Richard dies--
-Dickon returns to the roll of English knights.

796
01:18:53,975 --> 01:18:55,033
Am l not right?

797
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:59,112
With the manor and estate
of Robin of Locksley to support his rank.

798
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,113
-When shall l start?
-lmmediately. How many men will you need?

799
01:19:02,283 --> 01:19:05,184
l shall do it better alone, Your Highness.

800
01:19:05,353 --> 01:19:07,150
The sooner you're crowned king--

801
01:19:07,322 --> 01:19:11,520
The better for my friends?
You're a clever fellow, Gisbourne.

802
01:19:11,693 --> 01:19:14,685
Thank you, Your Majesty.

803
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:19,031
Return to your abbey and make
preparations to proclaim me king...

804
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,067
...here in Nottingham,
the day after tomorrow.

805
01:19:34,382 --> 01:19:36,407
Do you suppose she heard?

806
01:19:37,052 --> 01:19:38,610
l don't know.

807
01:19:47,462 --> 01:19:51,421
And now you know why Robin's got to find
King Richard at once and warn him.

808
01:19:51,599 --> 01:19:53,692
Take this note to Much at Saracen's Head.

809
01:20:19,527 --> 01:20:21,961
My lady's hearing
is a little defective tonight.

810
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:25,896
When you knock at a lady's door
as if it were a tavern, you deserve to wait.

811
01:20:26,067 --> 01:20:27,432
You seem upset.

812
01:20:27,602 --> 01:20:29,627
Upset? Why should l be?

813
01:20:30,405 --> 01:20:34,603
Oh, come now, my dear Lady Marian.
You've played the innocent long enough.

814
01:20:34,776 --> 01:20:37,768
-Let's be frank with one another.
-l don't see the need.

815
01:20:37,946 --> 01:20:41,814
You're charming, Lady Marian, but not
exactly clever. You couldn't have failed...

816
01:20:42,016 --> 01:20:44,780
...to overhear what Prince John
and l were talking about.

817
01:20:44,953 --> 01:20:47,547
Oh, no, no, no.
Please don't trouble to deny it.

818
01:20:47,722 --> 01:20:52,591
And your first thought, as Richard's
loyal ward, was to warn him.

819
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:56,059
-Am l not right?
-Why, how could l warn Richard?

820
01:20:56,231 --> 01:20:58,631
How did Locksley and his men
arrange his escape...

821
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,394
...from hanging after the archery match?

822
01:21:01,569 --> 01:21:04,470
Someone here in the castle
must have got word to him.

823
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:06,106
That's ridiculous!

824
01:21:06,274 --> 01:21:08,936
When Richard's in danger,
what more natural...

825
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:12,511
...than that you should try
to warn him through Locksley?

826
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:15,444
And you do intend to warn him, don't you?

827
01:21:15,884 --> 01:21:18,819
-Don't you?
-No!

828
01:21:23,291 --> 01:21:26,260
lf that's true,
perhaps you'd explain before Prince John...

829
01:21:26,427 --> 01:21:29,089
...and the Court of Execution
the meaning of this.

830
01:21:30,465 --> 01:21:32,456
Guard!

831
01:21:37,972 --> 01:21:39,940
Escort my Lady Marian to the Great Hall.

832
01:22:10,505 --> 01:22:13,497
Not only has she consorted with
this Saxon rebel...

833
01:22:13,675 --> 01:22:18,044
...found guilty of outlawry, theft,
murder, abduction and high treason...

834
01:22:18,213 --> 01:22:22,081
...but she has betrayed
her own Norman people.

835
01:22:22,517 --> 01:22:25,384
Are you not ashamed, my Lady Marian?

836
01:22:26,254 --> 01:22:30,918
Yes, l am. Bitterly. But it's a shame
that l'm a Norman...

837
01:22:31,092 --> 01:22:34,584
...after seeing the things my fellow
countrymen have done to England.

838
01:22:34,762 --> 01:22:38,858
At first l wouldn't believe. Because l was
a Norman l wouldn't let myself believe...

839
01:22:39,067 --> 01:22:41,900
...that the horrors you inflicted
on the Saxons weren't just.

840
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:45,904
l know now why you tried so hard
to kill this outlaw whom you despised.

841
01:22:46,074 --> 01:22:49,066
lt's because he was the one man
in England who protected the helpless...

842
01:22:49,244 --> 01:22:51,303
...against beasts
who were drunk on human blood!

843
01:22:51,479 --> 01:22:54,573
And now you intend
to murder your own brother!

844
01:22:54,882 --> 01:22:56,941
You'll be sorry you interfered.

845
01:22:57,118 --> 01:23:00,281
Sorry? l'd do it again if you kill me for it.

846
01:23:01,422 --> 01:23:06,724
A prophetic speech, my lady, for that
is exactly what is going to happen to you.

847
01:23:07,929 --> 01:23:10,693
You wouldn't dare.

848
01:23:10,865 --> 01:23:14,631
l'm the royal ward of King Richard
and no one but the king himself...

849
01:23:14,802 --> 01:23:17,236
...has the right to condemn me to death.

850
01:23:18,172 --> 01:23:20,197
You are quite right, my dear.

851
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:24,835
And it shall be a king who will order
your execution for high treason...

852
01:23:25,013 --> 01:23:28,210
...exactly 48 hours from now.

853
01:23:28,983 --> 01:23:30,541
Take her away.

854
01:23:34,689 --> 01:23:37,783
-Have you got it all in your stupid head now?
-Of course l have.

855
01:23:37,959 --> 01:23:41,053
Well, give Robin the whole message
exactly like l told it to you.

856
01:23:41,229 --> 01:23:44,289
Bess, where was Dickon
supposed to find King Richard?

857
01:23:44,465 --> 01:23:45,864
Oh, never mind him!

858
01:23:46,034 --> 01:23:48,696
What do l care about
your kings and thrones and such?

859
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:51,566
Robin has gotta do something
to save my baby!

860
01:23:51,739 --> 01:23:55,004
Come on, old girl.
Robin will look after her, all right.

861
01:23:55,176 --> 01:23:57,667
-Where's Dickon heading for?
-Kent Road Tavern.

862
01:23:57,845 --> 01:24:01,941
Kent Road Tavern? You can save three miles
and cut him off through Low Wood.

863
01:24:02,116 --> 01:24:05,017
Come on, lass,
give us a kiss and wish me luck.

864
01:24:07,021 --> 01:24:10,081
Hurry up and take your ugly face out of here.

865
01:24:10,258 --> 01:24:13,352
Oh, Much.
Oh, you will be careful, won't you?

866
01:24:13,528 --> 01:24:15,655
Of course l will.

867
01:25:34,175 --> 01:25:36,541
Greetings, sir abbot!

868
01:25:47,455 --> 01:25:51,016
-You've traveled far this morning?
-Too far to be patient with delay now.

869
01:25:51,192 --> 01:25:55,151
Perhaps it's the weight of your purse
that wearies you. Now, l can remedy that.

870
01:25:55,329 --> 01:25:59,561
lf it weighs more than a just amount
l'll share it with those who have less. Come.

871
01:25:59,734 --> 01:26:02,635
You think l hand my purse
to every rough lout who asks for it?

872
01:26:10,411 --> 01:26:11,844
You see, sir abbot?

873
01:26:12,013 --> 01:26:14,982
We're poor outlaws,
with nothing to eat but the king's deer...

874
01:26:15,149 --> 01:26:19,085
...while you have property,
rents, and silver. So your purse!

875
01:26:19,253 --> 01:26:22,347
l've traveled far on the king's business
and the silver l have left...

876
01:26:22,523 --> 01:26:23,888
...equals no more than 60 marks.

877
01:26:24,058 --> 01:26:27,323
What?
Are you friendly to our good King Richard?

878
01:26:28,296 --> 01:26:29,763
l love no man better.

879
01:26:29,931 --> 01:26:31,796
By that speech you save half your money.

880
01:26:31,966 --> 01:26:34,434
Give me 30 marks for the poor
and the rest you may keep.

881
01:26:34,602 --> 01:26:35,660
Then l can go free?

882
01:26:35,837 --> 01:26:40,865
Any friend of Richard's is free of this forest.
Would you honor us by sharing meat with us?

883
01:26:41,042 --> 01:26:42,907
-Gladly.
-Then come.

884
01:26:50,251 --> 01:26:54,415
-Well, sir rascal, tell me, who are you?
-l'm called Robin Hood.

885
01:26:54,589 --> 01:26:56,181
lt seems l've heard of you.

886
01:26:56,357 --> 01:26:59,622
-Nothing good, l hope.
-Oh, now l remember!

887
01:26:59,794 --> 01:27:02,627
How does your loyalty
to Richard set on a killer of knights...

888
01:27:02,797 --> 01:27:05,027
...a poacher of the king's deer
and an outlaw?

889
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:08,464
Those l kill died from misusing
the trust that Richard left them.

890
01:27:08,636 --> 01:27:11,196
And the worst rogue of these
is the king's own brother.

891
01:27:11,372 --> 01:27:14,000
-Oh, then you blame Prince John.
-No, l blame Richard.

892
01:27:14,175 --> 01:27:18,373
His task was defending his people instead
of deserting them to fight in foreign lands.

893
01:27:18,546 --> 01:27:20,537
What?
You'd condemn Holy Crusades?

894
01:27:20,715 --> 01:27:25,379
l'll condemn anything that leaves the task
of holding England to outlaws like me.

895
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:37,593
Much!

896
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:46,301
-Much, what's happened to you?
-Take me to Robin, quick!

897
01:28:08,195 --> 01:28:11,358
-Much, what's happened?
-King Richard's in England. ln Sherwood!

898
01:28:11,532 --> 01:28:12,692
What?

899
01:28:12,867 --> 01:28:16,598
Prince John sent Dickon to Kent Road Tavern
last night to kill the king.

900
01:28:16,771 --> 01:28:20,036
-Will, take 50 men to the Kent Road Tavern--
-No need, master, no need.

901
01:28:20,207 --> 01:28:24,075
l headed Dickon off.
He ain't gonna murder no one no more.

902
01:28:24,779 --> 01:28:28,613
-But the king? Where is he?
-l don't know, master.

903
01:28:29,283 --> 01:28:31,843
Men, Richard must be found.

904
01:28:32,019 --> 01:28:33,646
He must be brought here for safety.

905
01:28:33,821 --> 01:28:35,982
Little John, take a party
and scour the country.

906
01:28:36,157 --> 01:28:39,718
Friar Tuck, into the town.
Will, search every inn and cottage.

907
01:28:39,894 --> 01:28:42,692
Don't rest, day or night,
until he's found. Understand?

908
01:28:42,863 --> 01:28:45,889
You don't need to search for Richard, Robin.

909
01:28:46,067 --> 01:28:49,798
-He's in good hands. The best in England.
-What do you mean? Where is he?

910
01:28:50,638 --> 01:28:52,265
Here!

911
01:28:59,146 --> 01:29:00,977
Sire.

912
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:16,058
All these have remained loyal.

913
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:18,460
Rise, Sir Robin.

914
01:29:19,333 --> 01:29:20,960
Rise, men of Sherwood.

915
01:29:21,902 --> 01:29:24,564
Sire, Prince John's calling
Bishop of the Black Canons...

916
01:29:24,739 --> 01:29:26,832
...to proclaim him king
in Nottingham tomorrow.

917
01:29:27,008 --> 01:29:29,499
-How'd you learn this?
-Lady Marian. She overheard.

918
01:29:29,677 --> 01:29:31,406
They've taken her for treason.

919
01:29:31,579 --> 01:29:34,241
She's been condemned
to the block for warning us.

920
01:29:34,415 --> 01:29:36,349
He wouldn't dare execute the king's ward.

921
01:29:36,517 --> 01:29:40,112
You underestimate him. lf we're to save
her and your throne, we've got to act now!

922
01:29:40,287 --> 01:29:41,720
By attacking Nottingham castle?

923
01:29:41,889 --> 01:29:45,086
Without an army it'll be much too strong.
Your men will be killed.

924
01:29:45,259 --> 01:29:48,626
lf the Bishop of the Black Canons
is performing the ceremony tomorrow...

925
01:29:48,796 --> 01:29:52,892
...suppose we visit him at his abbey tonight
and persuade him to suggest a way.

926
01:30:15,089 --> 01:30:17,387
Brace up. Smile!

927
01:30:19,727 --> 01:30:21,388
Wider!

928
01:30:21,629 --> 01:30:24,621
Still sure it wasn't you
who warned my brother l was in England?

929
01:30:24,799 --> 01:30:26,426
Why, sire, believe me, l--

930
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:29,228
Your Grace, smile!

931
01:30:30,004 --> 01:30:32,302
You'll sweat the lard
off that fat carcass of yours...

932
01:30:32,473 --> 01:30:34,464
...before this day's over, my pudgy friend.

933
01:30:34,642 --> 01:30:38,510
And l hope some Norman sword
whittles you down to size!

934
01:30:50,558 --> 01:30:52,458
Oh, Lord, we beseech thee.

935
01:30:52,626 --> 01:30:56,426
Sanctify this thy servant,
our royal Prince John.

936
01:30:56,597 --> 01:31:02,001
Enrich his noble heart and bestow
upon him all princely virtues.

937
01:31:02,169 --> 01:31:03,898
Amen.

938
01:31:04,071 --> 01:31:05,732
No news of Richard.

939
01:31:05,906 --> 01:31:07,669
No. None, Your Highness.

940
01:31:07,842 --> 01:31:09,309
Then Dickon must have--

941
01:31:09,477 --> 01:31:11,968
Sir Dickon, Your Highness.

942
01:31:12,713 --> 01:31:16,205
Of course. Of course.

943
01:31:19,487 --> 01:31:23,218
We are ready for the ceremony,
Your Majesty.

944
01:33:40,861 --> 01:33:42,795
Remember.

945
01:33:48,535 --> 01:33:51,868
By what authority do you,
John Lackland, Prince of England...

946
01:33:52,039 --> 01:33:55,440
...claim to be crowned this day,
sovereign of the realm...

947
01:33:55,609 --> 01:33:59,545
...and as defender of the Holy Sepulcher,
to receive the blessing of the church?

948
01:33:59,713 --> 01:34:03,444
By right of blood succession.
According to the law of the realm.

949
01:34:03,617 --> 01:34:06,586
ls it of your own free will
that you thus depose your brother...

950
01:34:06,754 --> 01:34:08,483
...Richard the Lion-Heart of England?

951
01:34:08,656 --> 01:34:10,681
Richard no longer exists!

952
01:34:10,858 --> 01:34:13,759
From this moment forward,
l, John, am king of England!

953
01:34:14,895 --> 01:34:16,954
Aren't you a little premature, brother?

954
01:34:17,131 --> 01:34:19,599
Richard! The Lion-Heart!

955
01:34:19,767 --> 01:34:21,860
He's lying! He's an imposter!

956
01:34:22,102 --> 01:34:24,434
-The king lives!
-Men of Sherwood!

957
01:34:26,206 --> 01:34:27,195
Robin Hood!

958
01:34:27,374 --> 01:34:29,899
lt's a trick of the outlaws!
Kill him! Seize him!

959
01:35:56,530 --> 01:35:59,988
-Did l upset your plans?
-You've come to Nottingham once too often!

960
01:36:00,167 --> 01:36:02,658
When this is over, there'll be
no need for me to come again.

961
01:36:14,114 --> 01:36:16,105
Your sword, Gisbourne.

962
01:36:35,102 --> 01:36:37,696
-Know any prayers, my friend?
-l'll say one for you!

963
01:38:25,445 --> 01:38:26,912
Save yourself, Robin!

964
01:38:32,653 --> 01:38:36,953
The door, quick!
Quick, or l'll trim that beard for you!

965
01:39:14,561 --> 01:39:17,359
But, Richard, Richard! l thought--

966
01:39:17,531 --> 01:39:19,999
-You thought l was murdered!
-Oh, no, no.

967
01:39:20,701 --> 01:39:24,865
l didn't mean to....
After all, Richard, l am your brother.

968
01:39:25,038 --> 01:39:27,370
Yes, sire, he is your brother.

969
01:39:27,541 --> 01:39:28,838
Yes, my brother.

970
01:39:29,009 --> 01:39:32,467
l could forgive you if your treachery
were against me and not my subjects.

971
01:39:32,646 --> 01:39:36,241
l banish you and your followers from England
for the remainder of my lifetime.

972
01:39:36,416 --> 01:39:38,884
Take them away.
See that they leave England.

973
01:39:39,052 --> 01:39:42,647
l further banish from my realm
all injustices and oppressions...

974
01:39:42,823 --> 01:39:45,815
...which have burdened my people.
And l pray that under my rule...

975
01:39:45,993 --> 01:39:49,360
...Normans and Saxons alike
will share the rights of Englishmen.

976
01:39:49,529 --> 01:39:52,191
Long live Richard the Lion-Heart!

977
01:39:53,033 --> 01:39:55,331
What about you, Robin?

978
01:39:59,539 --> 01:40:02,064
My sword is yours, sire, now and always.

979
01:40:02,242 --> 01:40:04,335
ls there nothing the king
can grant the outlaw...

980
01:40:04,511 --> 01:40:06,274
...who showed him
his duty to his country?

981
01:40:06,446 --> 01:40:09,381
Yes, Your Majesty,
a pardon for the men of Sherwood.

982
01:40:09,549 --> 01:40:11,574
Granted with all my heart.

983
01:40:11,752 --> 01:40:14,312
Long live Richard the Lion-Heart!

984
01:40:15,022 --> 01:40:17,923
But is there nothing for yourself?

985
01:40:19,426 --> 01:40:21,792
There's but one thing else, sire.

986
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:24,930
And do you too wish...?

987
01:40:25,666 --> 01:40:28,191
More than anything in the world, sire.

988
01:40:29,169 --> 01:40:30,466
Kneel, Robin Hood.

989
01:40:32,973 --> 01:40:37,410
Arise, Robin, Baron of Locksley,
Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham...

...and lord of all the lands and manors
appertaining thereto.

991
01:40:40,747 --> 01:40:43,307
My first command to you, my lord earl...

992
01:40:43,483 --> 01:40:46,816
...is to take in marriage
the hand of the Lady Marian.

993
01:40:46,987 --> 01:40:51,617
Long live Robin Hood!

Long live Lady Marian!

And what say you to that,
Baron of Locksley?

996
01:41:03,370 --> 01:41:06,931
May l obey all your commands
with equal pleasure, sire!
