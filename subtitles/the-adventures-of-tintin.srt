2
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,110
Very nearly there, sir.

3
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,270
I have to say, your face is familiar.
Have I drawn you before?

4
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,400
Occasionally.

5
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,240
Of course! I've seen you in the newspaper.

6
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,160
- You're a reporter?
- I'm a journalist.

7
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,500
Be patient, Snowy, not much longer.

8
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,860
I do beg your pardon.

9
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,110
There.

10
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,170
I believe I have captured something
of your likeness.

11
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,590
Not bad!

12
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,170
What do you think, Snowy?

13
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,130
Snowy!

14
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,420
There you are, sir.

15
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,890
Now where's he run off to?

16
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,220
Anything?

17
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,520
Nothing.

18
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,530
Snowy!

19
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,440
Where have you been?

20
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,280
Chasing cats again?

21
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,710
Snowy, look at this!

22
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,470
Triple masted.

23
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,060
Double decks. Fifty guns.

24
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,010
Isn't she a beauty?

25
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,650
That's a very unique specimen, that is.
From an old sea captain's estate.

26
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,310
"The Unicorn."

27
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,980
Unicorn. Man o'war sailing ship.

28
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,820
It's very old, that is. 16th century.

29
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,190
17th, I would think.

30
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,110
- Reign of Charles I.
- Charles II.

31
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,990
That's what I said, Charles II.
As fine a ship as ever sailed the seven seas.

32
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,830
You won't find another one of these, mate.

33
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,290
And it's only two quid.

34
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,970
- I'll give you a pound.
- Done!

35
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,430
Gently does it.

36
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,510
Excuse me!

37
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,890
Here you go. Careful.

38
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,680
Hey, bud, how much for the boat?

39
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,890
I'm sorry, I just sold it to this young gent.

40
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,110
Oh, yeah?

41
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,520
Tell me what you paid
and I'll give you double.

42
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,850
- Double?
- Thanks. But it's not for sale.

43
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,770
Look, kid, I'm trying to help you out.

44
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,690
I don't think you realise this,

45
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,120
but you're about to walk
into a whole mess of danger.

46
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,660
What kind of danger?

47
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,660
I'm warning you, get rid of the boat
and get out while you still can.

48
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,200
These people do not play nice.

49
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,460
What people?

50
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,710
Wonderful!

51
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,380
It's just wonderful.

52
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,670
Don't bother wrapping it, I'll take it as is.
Does anybody object if I pay by cheque?

53
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,930
If you want to buy it,
you'll have to talk to the kid.

54
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,230
I see.

55
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,010
Well, let the "kid" name his price.

56
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,770
"Name his price"?

57
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,890
Ten years I've been flogging bric-a-brac

58
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,480
and I miss "name your price"
by one bleedin' minute!

59
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,440
I'm sorry.
I already explained to the other gentleman.

60
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,570
American he was. All hair oil and no socks.

61
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,830
It's not for sale.

62
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,410
Then let me appeal to your better nature.

63
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,910
I have recently acquired Marlinspike Hall,

64
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:55,080
and this ship, as I'm sure you're aware,
was once part of the estate.

65
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,460
Of the late sea captain?

66
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,750
The family fell upon hard times.
Lost everything.

67
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,170
They've been living in a cloud
of bad luck ever since.

68
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:07,930
We are talking generations of drinking
and irrational behaviour...

69
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,390
I'm sorry.

70
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,600
But as I told you before, it's not for sale.

71
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,070
Good day to you, sir.

72
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,110
That young man, what's his name?

73
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,750
Him? Everybody knows him. That's Tintin.

74
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,380
What is it about this ship?

75
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,300
Why has it attracted so much attention?

76
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,260
What secrets do you hold?

77
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,320
Where is that magnifying glass?

78
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,610
I could have sworn it was...

79
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,620
Where could it possibly be?

80
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,330
Snowy, you haven't seen the...

81
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,800
Where is it?

82
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,930
Thank you.

83
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,060
No, Snowy!

84
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,990
Look what you did.

85
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,370
You broke it!

86
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,120
Bad dog!

87
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,300
Something happened on this ship.

88
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,550
And we're going to the one place
that could have the answer.

89
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,180
Come on, Snowy.

90
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,370
Here it is.

91
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,040
"Sir Francis Haddock of Marlinspike Hall,
the last captain of the ill-fated Unicorn.

92
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,580
"The ship set sail from Barbados in 1676

93
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,130
"on one of the most ruinous voyages
in maritime history.

94
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,930
"Ship never reached destination.

95
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,300
"Attacked by pirates,
all hands lost except for one survivor.

96
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,930
"When Sir Francis was rescued
and returned home,

97
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,050
"he was convinced his name
had been cursed.

98
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,510
"The Unicorn's manifest stated

99
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,220
"that it was carrying a cargo of rum
and tobacco bound for Europe,

100
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,610
"but it was long claimed
the ship was carrying a secret cargo."

101
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,620
What was the ship carrying, Snowy?

102
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,280
"Historians have tried and failed to discover
what happened on that fatal voyage,

103
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,630
"but Sir Francis' last words,

104
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,880
"'Only a true Haddock will discover
the secret of the Unicorn."'

105
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,410
I've missed something, Snowy.

106
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,410
We need to take a closer look at that model.

107
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,920
Of course it's gone!

108
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,010
How could I be so stupid?

109
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,080
How'd you do that?

110
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,620
Clever boy.

111
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,230
A coat of arms.

112
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,350
Why does that look familiar?

113
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,070
Hang on a minute.

114
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,600
That fish!

115
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,240
It's a haddock.

116
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,410
Of course!
Marlinspike Hall is the old Haddock estate.

117
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,330
Snowy!

118
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,600
Well done, Snowy!

119
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,980
Good boy.

120
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,040
Well, well, well.

121
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,170
It seems we've caught our thief.

122
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,670
Welcome to Marlinspike Hall.

123
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,960
I see you let yourself in.

124
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,220
I came to retrieve my property.

125
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,840
I'm sorry, I'm not sure I follow you.

126
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,350
I think you do.

127
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,680
This ship was stolen from my apartment
less than an hour ago.

128
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,440
I'm afraid you're mistaken, Mr. Tintin.

129
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,690
There's no mistake. It belongs to me.

130
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,240
Are you sure?

131
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,780
Of course I'm sure.

132
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,240
I took it home,
I put it on a cabinet in the living room,

133
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,670
and then Snowy chased the cat
and knocked it over, and it

134
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,420
fell.

135
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,330
This isn't my ship.

136
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,090
No. Indeed.

137
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,630
I'm sorry.

138
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,130
- It looks identical.
- Well, looks can be deceiving.

139
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,220
Yes, indeed. But I don't understand!

140
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,720
Why did Sir Francis make two ships
exactly alike?

141
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,270
And you have one already.
Why do you want another?

142
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,270
What is it about this model
that would cause someone to steal it?

143
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,980
Goodness me, why so many questions?

144
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,400
It's my job.

145
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,440
There could be a story here.
That's what I do, you see.

146
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,070
Well, it's no great mystery.

147
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,070
Sir Francis Haddock was a drunkard
and a hopeless reprobate.

148
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:11,710
He was doomed to fail,
and he bequeathed that failure to his sons.

149
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,880
So it's true! The Haddock line is cursed.

150
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,140
- What else have you found out?
- What is there to find?

151
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,350
That depends what you're looking for.

152
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,850
I'm looking for answers, Mr. Sakharine.

153
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,440
You're looking in the wrong place.

154
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,020
It's late.

155
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,100
I think you should go home.

156
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,690
This way, sir.

157
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,460
It's a pity, sir.

158
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,380
I'm sorry?

159
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,880
That the mast broke on your model ship, sir.

160
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,710
I hope you found all the pieces.

161
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,340
Things are so easily lost.

162
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,890
Nestor! Where are you?

163
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,220
Good night, sir.

164
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,690
Some things are easily lost.

165
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,600
What did he mean by that, Snowy?

166
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,310
What was he trying to tell me?

167
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,570
Some things are easily lost.

168
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,790
Snowy!

169
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,380
Great snakes!

170
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,260
What is it, Snowy?

171
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,830
What's this?

172
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,710
This was in the mast!

173
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,300
Good boy, Snowy.

174
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,750
"Three brothers joined.

175
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,430
"Three Unicorns in company

176
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,640
"sailing in the noonday sun will speak.

177
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,510
"For 'tis from the light that light will dawn.

178
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,440
"And then shines forth the Eagle's Cross."

179
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,950
What are these markings?

180
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,740
Some kind of secret language or code?

181
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,900
It makes no sense.

182
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,570
But it does explain
why they ransacked the flat.

183
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,420
They were looking for this,
and they didn't find it.

184
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,290
Which means

185
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,630
they'll be back.

186
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,330
No, I don't know where he is, dearie.
I think he's gone out.

187
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,250
And anyway, it's after dark,

188
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:11,270
and Mr. Tintin is most particular
about not admitting visitors after bedtime.

189
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,890
I have to go back to my cocoa.

190
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,010
I've got a very good book and a cup of cocoa.

191
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,930
It's really lovely!

192
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,030
Thank you, Mrs. Finch. I can look after this.

193
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,620
Hey, kid, is that you? Open the door.

194
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,400
What do you want?

195
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,240
Look, the game is up. He's gonna be back.

196
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,780
Now, I know he wanted those boats,
but I swear to God,

197
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,710
I never thought he'd kill anyone over it!

198
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,290
Who? Who are you talking about?

199
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,830
I'm trying to tell you
that your life is in danger.

200
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:44,930
Answer me! Who?

201
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,320
Mrs. Finch!
A man's been shot on our doorstep!

202
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,950
- Not again.
- Call an ambulance!

203
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,830
No, Snowy!

204
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,090
Can you hear me?

205
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,510
Can you...

206
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,310
The victim's name was Barnaby Dawes.

207
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,850
He was one of the top agents at Interpol,

208
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,020
but we haven't got a clue
what he was working on.

209
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,730
Quite right, Thompson.
We're completely clueless.

210
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,440
Interpol doesn't have any other leads?

211
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,110
Steady on, Tintin.
We're still filling out the paperwork.

212
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,740
Police work's not all glamour and guns.
There's an awful lot of filing.

213
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,330
Well, I might have something for you.

214
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,910
Before he lost consciousness,
Dawes tried to tell me something,

215
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,960
and I think he was spelling out a word.

216
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,090
"...B- O-U

217
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,520
"D-J-A-N.

218
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,090
"Karaboudjan."

219
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,600
Karaboudjan!

220
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,470
Does that mean anything to you?

221
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,720
Great Scotland Yard! That's extraordinary!

222
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,820
What is?

223
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,270
Worthington's have a half-price sale
on bowler hats!

224
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:28,190
Really, Thomson! This is hardly the time.

225
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,270
- Great Scotland Yard!
- What is it?

226
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,400
Canes are half-price, too!

227
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,200
Are you going to take charge
of this evidence?

228
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,320
Positively.

229
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,580
Never fear, Tintin,
the evidence is safe with us!

230
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,170
Thomson? Where are you?

231
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,540
Well, I'm already downstairs.
Do try to keep up.

232
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,660
Wait! You dropped this.

233
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,580
Good heavens, Thomson!
Look after the evidence, man.

234
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,090
Sorry, Thompson.
My mind is on other things.

235
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,010
Yes. Our light-fingered larcenist.

236
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,880
- What?
- The pickpocket.

237
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,510
He has no idea what's coming.

238
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,270
Go on, Tintin, take my wallet.

239
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:10,270
Yes, industrial strength elastic.

240
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,100
Very resourceful.

241
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,940
On the contrary. It was childishly simple.

242
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,780
Simply childish, I agree.

243
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,950
- Tintin.
- Tintin.

244
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,370
Gentlemen.

245
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,450
Mind you, I expect he's miles away by now.

246
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,490
I presume you're referring to the pickpocket?

247
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:30,050
Yes. I mean,
knowing we're just a few steps behind him.

248
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,380
Snowy, what is it, boy? What do you see?

249
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,290
I don't suppose you'd fancy a cup of tea?

250
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,550
You're quite mistaken. I'd love one.

251
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,060
My treat.

252
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,340
- I've got you now!
- You devil!

253
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,900
Stop, in the name of the law!

254
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,650
Got you!

255
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,650
What's going on down there?

256
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,860
Come on, Snowy!

257
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,990
- I do beg your pardon.
- Sorry, sir!

258
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:03,660
The pickpocket, Tintin! He's getting away!

259
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
My wallet!

260
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,210
It's gone!

261
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,160
Come on! Snowy, after him!

262
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,630
Stop! Wait!

263
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,310
- Got you!
- Steady on.

264
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,430
I've lost him!

265
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,520
You must find my wallet.
It's very important. I have to get it back.

266
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,160
And you will. Leave it to the professionals.

267
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,780
We've lost the scroll.

268
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,200
But we haven't lost the story.

269
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,780
"Karaboudjan."

270
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,030
It's an Armenian word.
That's our lead, Snowy.

271
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:51,270
What was Barnaby Dawes trying to tell us
when he said our lives were in danger?

272
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,790
- Mr. Tin... Tin?
- Yes.

273
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,380
- Delivery for you.
- But I didn't order anything.

274
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,930
Well, that's because it's you
that's getting delivered!

275
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,350
Quick, get him in the van!

276
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,480
Get off me, you confounded mutt!

277
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,060
He bit me!

278
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,320
Quick!

279
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,930
Get him off!

280
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,020
Shake him off, then run him over!

281
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,110
I want this on the starboard side!

282
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,650
Not here. Look your side.

283
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,990
Hang on.

284
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,710
- Nothing.
- Well, check that pocket, Tom.

285
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,750
No, I've looked in this one already,
I'm sure of it.

286
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,000
Well, have a look in his socks.

287
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,910
- Have you found it?
- He doesn't have it.

288
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,390
It's not on him, boss. It's not here.

289
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,720
- Not here? Then where is it?
- Where's what?

290
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,930
I am tired of your games.
The scroll, from the Unicorn.

291
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:08,130
A piece of paper like this!

292
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,770
You mean the poem?

293
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Yes.

294
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,680
- The poem written in Old English.
- Yes.

295
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,060
- It was inside a cylinder.
- Yes.

296
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,610
- Concealed in the mast.
- Yes!

297
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,110
I don't have it.

298
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:29,900
You know the value of that scroll.
Why else would you take it?

299
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,870
Two ships and two scrolls,
both part of a puzzle.

300
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,660
You have one, you need the other.

301
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,090
But that's not it. There's something else.

302
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:45,010
I will find it, with or without your help.

303
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,930
You need to think about
exactly how useful you are to me.

304
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,010
- We'll deal with him on the way.
- Aye-aye, sir.

305
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,730
Hold this course.

306
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,990
Snowy!

307
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,160
It's good to see you, too.
See if you can chew through these ropes.

308
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:21,000
He's lying! He must have the scroll.
The question is, what has he done with it?

309
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,830
We searched him all over, boss.

310
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,670
I want you to go back down there
and make him talk.

311
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,550
Break every bone in his body if you have to!

312
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,710
That's nasty.

313
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:32,760
You know the stakes.
You know what we're playing for. Just do it!

314
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,930
Mr. Sakharine! Mr. Sakharine!
All hell has broken loose!

315
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,060
It's a disaster! The captain has come around.

316
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,770
- What?
- He's conscious.

317
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,730
He's accusing you of mutiny.

318
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,350
- He says you turned the crew against him.
- Sounds like he's sobered up again.

319
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,030
Well, don't just stand there.
Get him another bottle.

320
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,700
Aye, sir!

321
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,210
Okay.

322
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,920
- Jiggle it a bit, it's just stuck.
- Jiggle?

323
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,020
Here.

324
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,890
What are you doing? Get off!

325
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,270
It's not stuck, you idiot.
He's bolted it from the inside!

326
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,030
So you want to play like that then,
do you, Tintin?

327
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,540
Get the TNT.

328
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,370
Broken crates. Rope. Champagne.

329
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,750
What else do we have, Snowy?

330
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,920
There are other ways to open this door.

331
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,550
They'll be swabbing the decks
with your innards when we're done with you.

332
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,970
Give it here.

333
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,420
- Don't move.
- What...

334
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,760
Let's go!

335
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,250
Let me have him!

336
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,430
He's got a big shooter!

337
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,140
He got me!

338
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,350
Hold your fire.

339
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,990
He ain't here. He's vanished.

340
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,360
He's hiding.

341
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,660
Search the ship. Quickly!

342
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:09,420
A giant rat of Sumatra!

343
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,500
So, you thought you could
sneak in behind me

344
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,260
and catch me with my trousers down, huh?

345
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,710
I'd rather you kept your trousers on,
if it's all the same to you.

346
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,470
- I know your game. You're one of them.
- Sorry?

347
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,320
- They sent you here to kill me, huh?
- Look, I don't know who you are!

348
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,060
That's how he's planned to bump me off.

349
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:29,530
Murdered in my bed
by a baby-faced assassin!

350
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,360
Assassin? Look, you've got it all wrong.

351
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,950
I was kidnapped by a gang of thugs.

352
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,740
The filthy swine.

353
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,910
He's turned the whole crew against me!

354
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,010
Who?

355
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,580
A sour-faced man with a sugary name.

356
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,460
He's bought them all off, every last man.

357
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,630
Sakharine!

358
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,960
Nobody takes my ship!

359
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,090
You're the captain?

360
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:59,380
Of course I'm the captain.
Who else could I be?

361
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,760
I've been locked in this room for days

362
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,690
with only whisky to sustain my mortal soul.

363
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,360
Well, I assumed it was locked.

364
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,940
Well, it's not.

365
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,110
Now, you must excuse me.
If they find me here, they'll kill me.

366
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:24,320
I have to keep moving.
Try and find my way off this drunken tub.

367
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,170
"Tub"? Tub?

368
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,460
Tub?

369
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,720
- Thanks.
- Pleasure.

370
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,180
I'm Tintin, by the way.

371
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,560
Haddock. Archibald Haddock.

372
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,970
There's a longboat up on deck. Follow me.

373
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,390
Hang on a second.

374
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,820
Did you say "Haddock"?

375
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,900
How could you let them escape?

376
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,480
Find them. Find them both.

377
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,990
- Don't worry, we'll kill them, sir.
- No.

378
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,700
You can kill the boy. Not Haddock.

379
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,030
What? He's just a hopeless old soak.

380
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,330
We should've killed him long since.

381
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:14,250
You think it's an accident
that I chose Haddock's ship, Haddock's crew,

382
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,970
Haddock's treacherous first mate?

383
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,050
Nothing is an accident.

384
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:29,890
We go back a long way,
Captain Haddock and I.

385
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,850
We've unfinished business.

386
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:37,070
And this time, I'm going to make him pay.

387
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:42,190
We have to reach a locked door at the end
of this corridor. This is gonna be tricky.

388
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,590
You wouldn't happen to be related

389
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,550
to the Haddocks of Marlinspike Hall,
would you?

390
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:46,910
Why do you ask?

391
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,490
It's for a story I've been working on.

392
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:51,200
An old shipwreck that happened
off the coast of Barbados.

393
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,050
A man o'war. Triple masted. Fifty guns.

394
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:00,670
- What do you know of the Unicorn?
- Not a lot. That's why I'm asking you.

395
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,210
The secret of that ship
is known only to my family!

396
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:07,260
It's been passed down
from generation to generation.

397
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,190
My granddaddy himself,
with his dying breath, told me the tale.

398
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,020
And?

399
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,860
Gone.

400
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,940
What do you mean, gone?

401
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,440
I was so upset when he kicked the bucket,
I had no choice but to drown my sorrows.

402
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:25,070
When I woke up in the morning, it was gone!
I'd forgotten it all.

403
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,900
- Everything?
- Every last word.

404
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,070
Well, is there somebody else in your family?
Maybe they would know.

405
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,410
Sir Francis had three sons.
All but my bloodline failed.

406
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,620
I am the last of the Haddocks!

407
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,380
Did you say three sons?

408
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,430
Let's check below!

409
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,300
There is a bottle of rum for the man
who finds Haddock.

410
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,300
And kill the boy. Hope I find him first.

411
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,810
What's that?

412
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,970
You're hearing things.

413
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,390
Quiet, Ali.

414
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,480
There's nothing there.

415
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,230
Let's go up.

416
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,810
I know what Sakharine's looking for.

417
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:03,650
- What are you raving on about?
- It was written on the scroll.

418
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,620
"Three brothers joined.

419
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,110
"Three Unicorns in company
sailing in the noonday sun will speak."

420
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,250
Really?

421
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,870
Sir Francis didn't make two models
of the Unicorn.

422
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,170
He made three!

423
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,870
Three ships for three sons.

424
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,090
Excellent!

425
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,800
Sakharine's after the third model ship.

426
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,630
Barnacles! Someone's locked the door!

427
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,930
- Well, is there a key?
- A key?

428
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,110
Yes, now, that would be the problem.

429
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,910
Mr. Jaggerman!

430
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:47,650
Top bunk in the centre. Keeper of the keys.

431
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:52,490
Careful, mind. He's a restless sleeper
on account of the tragic loss of his eyelids.

432
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,370
- He lost his eyelids?
- Aye.

433
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:57,290
Now, that was a card game to remember.

434
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,660
You really had to be there.

435
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,120
I'd do this myself, Tintin,

436
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,880
but you've a lighter tread
and less chance of waking the boys.

437
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:10,010
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- You've nothing to worry about.

438
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,310
Provided they all stay asleep.

439
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,480
I wouldn't get too close to Mr. Hobbs.

440
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,810
He's very handy with a razor.

441
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,900
And I'd steer clear of Mr. Gitch.

442
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,830
Sacked as a shepherd
on account of his "animal husbandry."

443
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,600
Not the sandwich.

444
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,980
The keys!

445
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,500
You're a brave lad, Tintin.

446
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,170
My heart was in my mouth,
I don't mind telling you.

447
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:29,500
Well, that is, if it was my heart.

448
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,650
Judging by my stomach,
it could've been anything, really.

449
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,560
Hurry up, Captain! We've no time to lose.

450
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,260
Bingo!

451
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,850
Just the necessities, of course.

452
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,530
To the lifeboats.

453
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,490
Ease it in!

454
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,150
Put your back into it!

455
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,360
Hold her there, steady!

456
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,790
Any sign of him, Jumbo?

457
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:59,750
Nothing yet. Watch yourself.
The boss says he's a handful.

458
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,850
Come on.

459
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,480
It's Allan.

460
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:38,530
- Is that the bridge?
- Aye, on the other side of the radio room.

461
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,490
Radio room?

462
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:43,700
Wait here, Captain.
Sound the alarm if anyone comes.

463
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,420
Careful, Tintin.

464
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,080
I can't see a thing!

465
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:52,040
Quit your whining and find the kid!

466
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,840
I didn't sign on for this!

467
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,180
Keep searching!

468
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,840
- Message just come through, boss.
- What's it say?

469
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:03,180
"The Milanese Nightingale has landed.
Waiting in the wings for action."

470
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,100
"Milanese Nightingale"?

471
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,030
Now pray this cheers him up.

472
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,750
"Bagghar."

473
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,340
What's this?

474
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,260
"The Sultanate of Bagghar

475
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,350
"ruled over by Sheikh Omar Ben Salaad,

476
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:39,640
"whose love of music and culture
is matched only by his love of..."

477
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,020
Great snakes!

478
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,070
Bagghar.

479
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,110
The Port of Bagghar.

480
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,530
Morocco.

481
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,130
Tintin!

482
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,590
Hey! Put your hands up!

483
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:17,010
And let that be a lesson to you!

484
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,220
Help me!

485
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,360
In here! He's in here!

486
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,690
Here! By the lifeboats!

487
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,270
Out of the way!

488
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,240
After him! Get him!

489
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,960
Quick, quick, in here!

490
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,010
Over there!

491
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,430
Why, you little...

492
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,530
- He's up there!
- Go!

493
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,960
I can see him now!

494
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,630
Don't let them get away!

495
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,680
Help me!

496
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,720
- Turn this ship around!
- Aye, sir!

497
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,350
Get me a flare!

498
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,400
Captain, get down! Get down!

499
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,700
- There he is!
- Get out of the way!

500
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,670
Now! Full ahead! Full speed!

501
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,050
Got you now.

502
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,800
Stay down.

503
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,020
Look! Down there!

504
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,490
Idiots! You idiots! What have you done?

505
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,700
We killed them, boss, like you wanted!

506
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,330
No! Not like I wanted!
I needed Haddock alive!

507
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,550
Wait a minute, boss!
There are two boats missing!

508
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,590
So, that one must have been a decoy.

509
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,260
They're onto us, and our destination.

510
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:16,730
Find them! Make absolutely certain
they never reach Bagghar!

511
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,110
Yes, boss.

512
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,920
Get up there!

513
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,530
We have to get to Bagghar
ahead of Sakharine.

514
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,170
I know. I know.

515
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,960
Why?

516
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,500
Because he has the third model ship.

517
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,220
How do you know?

518
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,260
The Sheikh collects old ships. And this

519
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,270
is the prize of his collection.

520
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,850
Blistering blue barnacles,
that is the Unicorn!

521
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,940
Captain, do you see the distortion
around the model?

522
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,000
Aye.

523
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:01,060
It means that Ben Salaad exhibits it
in a bulletproof glass case in his palace.

524
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,860
And Sakharine is going there to steal it!

525
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,520
Yes, he has a secret weapon.
The Milanese Nightingale.

526
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,310
But that won't be enough
to solve the mystery,

527
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:11,570
and that is why Sakharine needs you.

528
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,110
That's why he made you his prisoner.

529
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:16,250
There is something
he needs you to remember.

530
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,670
I don't follow you.

531
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,470
I read it in a book.

532
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:27,090
That only a true Haddock
can discover the secret of the Unicorn.

533
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,890
I don't remember anything about anything.

534
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:37,940
But you must know about your ancestors,
Sir Francis. It's your family legacy!

535
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,330
My memory is not what it used to be.

536
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:42,110
- Well, what did it used to be?
- I've forgotten.

537
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:44,610
Captain,

538
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:46,780
can you get us to Bagghar?

539
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,700
What sort of a stupid question is that?

540
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,570
Give me those oars!
I'll show you some real seamanship, laddie.

541
00:43:55,670 --> 00:44:01,370
I'll not be doubted by some pipsqueak tuft
of ginger and his irritating dog!

542
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:05,510
I am master and commander of the seas!

543
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:11,010
I know these waters better than the warts
on my mother's face!

544
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,270
Look at the pair of them. Fast asleep.

545
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:20,770
Typical landlubbers.
Aye, no stamina these days.

546
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:24,490
Never mind. I'll get you there, Tintin.

547
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,210
Look, Thomson. There's the fellow.

548
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:46,340
Oh, my.

549
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:58,800
- Mr. Silk?
- Yes?

550
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,100
- My name is Thompson.
- And Thomson.

551
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,160
- We're police officers!
- We're police officers!

552
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,280
Oh, crumbs.

553
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,020
Good gracious!

554
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,400
- Mr. Silk!
- Mr. Silk!

555
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,190
- Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
- Are you okay?

556
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,620
Poor fellow!

557
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,950
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right, sir?

558
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,580
- Here, let me help you up.
- Thank you, that's very kind.

559
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,000
- No need to run away, sir.
- No, no, you see,

560
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,500
yesterday we very nearly caught the
pickpocket who's been terrorising the town!

561
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,590
Pickpocket?

562
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:31,960
We pulled his jacket off
and inside we found a wallet.

563
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,920
A wallet with your name and address!

564
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,340
- That's my wallet.
- Well, it's obvious he stole it from you.

565
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,330
- No, no, that's my wallet.
- Are you all right, sir?

566
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:41,040
We didn't mean to startle you.
Let us help you into your apartment.

567
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,470
Thank you so much. No need to come in.
I'll be quite all right, really.

568
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:47,190
- No, we insist.
- Better safe than sorry.

569
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:49,560
- It's the least we can do.
- Thank you.

570
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,110
There we are.

571
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,150
Good grief! What's all this?

572
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,290
It's my collection?

573
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,660
- What a lot of wallets!
- I can't help it.

574
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,790
It started with coin purses
and sort of went on from there, really.

575
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:07,120
You want to be careful. Haven't you heard?
There's a pickpocket about.

576
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,960
- Yes, he'd love this. Can you imagine?
- What do you mean, "pickpocket"?

577
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,500
A master criminal.

578
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,260
A bag-snatching, purse-pilfering,
wallet-lifting sneak thief!

579
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,930
I'm not a bad person.

580
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,520
I'm a kleptomaniac.

581
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,770
- A what?
- It's a fear of open spaces.

582
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,890
Poor man. No wonder he keeps his wallets
in the living room.

583
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:30,730
Wallets.
I just can't resist the lovely little things.

584
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,480
It's a harmless little habit, really.

585
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,820
Good heavens, Thomson, look at this!
His name's Thompson, too.

586
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,940
What a coincidence.

587
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,740
No, Thomson, this is Thomson without a "P,"
as in "psychic."

588
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,950
No, no, no, it's Thompson with a "P,"
as in "psychologist."

589
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:46,370
Look at this one!
A green one that I managed to pick

590
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,750
from a pickpocket
actually pickpocketing at the time.

591
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:50,890
- And this one! Cuir de cochon.
- No, you have it all wrong.

592
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:53,580
- There is a "P" in "psychic."
- I am not your sidekick! You are mine!

593
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,290
- Smell it, won't you? Piggy leather!
- No, you have it all wrong.

594
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,010
- How dare you!
- How dare you!

595
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:00,050
- I met you first.
- I met you first.

596
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,260
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

597
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,390
- No, you did not.
- Yes, I did.

598
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:03,440
- Didn't!
- Did!

599
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,810
- Listen! I can't stand it any more!
- Hey!

600
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:08,060
All right, I'll come quietly.

601
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,600
Take them! Take them! Take them all!

602
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,770
Stop it. Pull yourself together, man!

603
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:15,360
We can't take your wallets!
Do we look like thieves?

604
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,620
Good heavens, Thompson.

605
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,570
This looks familiar.

606
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,000
Can't be.

607
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:22,870
It is!

608
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:24,330
- Tintin!
- Tintin!

609
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,660
I'm so cold.

610
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,550
And thirsty.

611
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,630
My throat is parched.

612
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,730
Let's see if there's any fresh water.

613
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,400
What have we here?

614
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,180
Tintin.

615
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,370
Come and warm yourself, laddie.

616
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,250
Captain?

617
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:10,830
- What have you done?
- No need to thank me.

618
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:11,930
What?

619
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,920
Well, you looked a little cold,
so I lit a wee fire.

620
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,080
In a boat?

621
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:19,500
No! Those are our oars! We need those oars!

622
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,300
Yes, but not for much longer.

623
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,560
Have you gone mad?
Quick, Captain, help me!

624
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,350
- Captain, help me, quick!
- He's right. What have I done?

625
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:29,770
- What have I done?
- No, Captain, not that!

626
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,860
Thundering typhoons!

627
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,060
Well, this is a fine mess.

628
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,380
- I'm weak.
- We're stranded here...

629
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,020
- Selfish.
...with no hope of rescue...

630
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,230
I'm hopeless.

631
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:43,390
...while Sakharine and his men
are halfway to Bagghar.

632
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:45,450
Poor, miserable wretch!

633
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:47,080
Yes, all right. That's enough of that.

634
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:52,040
It was his fault, you see. It was Sir Francis.

635
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,620
Tell me, how did you work that one out?

636
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,620
Because he was a figurehead
of great courage and bold exploits.

637
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,800
No one like him ever existed in my family.

638
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:02,880
Why do you think I drink?

639
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:05,050
Because I know I'll never be like him.

640
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:09,980
No, it's far better that I end it now.
Put us both out of our misery.

641
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:13,720
What is it, Snowy?

642
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,360
I'm gonna lower myself into the sea.

643
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:23,410
Into the cold embrace of the big blue!

644
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,530
Those are Portuguese markings.

645
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,610
- Are you even listening?
- Where is the Karaboudjan registered?

646
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,280
We're saved.

647
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,700
We're saved!

648
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,840
It's a sign from above!

649
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,420
- Troglodytes!
- Captain, get down.

650
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,930
Slave-traders! Mutant malingerers!

651
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:50,850
Freshwater politicians!

652
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:54,430
Bad news, Captain.
We've only got one bullet.

653
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:57,440
- And what's the good news?
- We've got one bullet.

654
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,710
You got him!

655
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:18,260
Well done, my boy.

656
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,260
Stay here, Captain.

657
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,460
Tintin?

658
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:34,190
- Don't take your eyes off of them.
- Hurry up!

659
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:39,150
Just as I thought.
The ignition lead has been cut.

660
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,940
Lucky shot!

661
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,450
One more pass, and we will finish them off.

662
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:46,740
Put your hands in the air.

663
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,120
Now!

664
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,750
Let's see here.

665
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:59,090
You do know what you're doing, eh, Tintin?

666
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,800
More or less.

667
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,710
Well, which is it? More or less?

668
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:10,140
Relax. I interviewed a pilot once.

669
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,820
Which way to North Africa?

670
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,420
Captain, look!

671
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:37,840
We've caught up with them.

672
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,540
Wonderful!

673
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,420
But you think we might find another way
to North Africa

674
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,220
that doesn't take us
through that Wall of Death?

675
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,090
We can't turn back.

676
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:55,790
Not now.

677
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:23,130
No, Captain! Those are surgical spirits
for medicinal purposes only.

678
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:25,670
Quite right, laddie, quite right.

679
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,600
No, no, no!

680
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,190
The fuel tank! It's almost empty!

681
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:29,950
Captain! This may sound crazy,
but I've got a plan.

682
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:34,120
The alcohol in that bottle
may give us a few more miles.

683
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,610
I need you to climb out of the plane
and pour it into the fuel tank.

684
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,420
Christopher Columbus!

685
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:49,550
There's a terrible storm out there.

686
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,720
And it's raining.

687
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:55,430
And you call yourself a Haddock?

688
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:02,560
Captain!

689
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:05,020
Captain! Can you hear me?

690
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,360
Captain!

691
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:08,440
Captain?

692
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:14,070
You're doing fine!
Now, pour the bottle into the tank.

693
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:16,910
We're running on fumes.

694
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:19,490
Fumes!

695
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:29,970
Oh, no.

696
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,390
Captain! I can't see!

697
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:49,190
Land! Land!

698
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:51,440
We can't! We're not there yet!

699
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,320
No, land!

700
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,920
No, no, no, starboard! Starboard! Starboard!

701
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,080
Hang on, Tintin!

702
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,880
I'm coming!

703
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,600
The Land of Thirst.

704
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,920
- The Land of Thirst.
- Will you stop saying that?

705
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:45,100
You don't understand. I've run out.

706
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:49,890
I've run out.
You don't know what that means.

707
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,680
Captain, we have to keep going.

708
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:55,270
One step at a time. Come on, on your feet!
Lean your weight on me.

709
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:58,810
A man can only hang on so long
without his vitals.

710
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:01,980
Captain, calm down.
There are worse things than sobering up.

711
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,660
Look! Tintin!

712
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:05,500
We're saved.

713
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:08,290
Water. Water!

714
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,460
Stop! Captain!

715
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:12,450
It's just a mirage!

716
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:15,460
But it was here. I saw it.

717
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,460
It was just your mind playing tricks.
It's the heat!

718
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,220
I have to go home.

719
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:24,720
- What?
- I have to go back to the sea.

720
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,800
Captain, you're hallucinating.

721
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:27,900
Look.

722
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:32,150
Did you ever see a more beautiful sight?

723
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:37,490
She's turning into the wind, all sails set.

724
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,200
Triple masted.

725
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:43,660
Double decks. Fifty guns.

726
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,990
The Unicorn?

727
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:49,410
- Isn't she a beauty?
- Yes! Yes, she is!

728
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:52,420
Tell me, Captain, what else can you see?

729
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,330
She's got the wind behind her.

730
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:58,510
Look at the pace she's setting!

731
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:02,460
Barely a day out of Barbados,

732
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:05,260
a hold full of rum and the finest tobacco

733
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:08,810
and the hearts of the sailors set for home.

734
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:36,840
The red pennant.

735
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,620
The blood runs cold in every sea captain
who looks upon that flag,

736
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,960
for he knows he's facing a fight to the death.

737
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:46,880
But Sir Francis is a Haddock.

738
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:50,480
And Haddocks don't flee.

739
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:57,180
All hands on deck! Gunners to their stations!

740
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,030
Let's unload the King's shot into these

741
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:02,730
yellow-bellied, lily-livered sea slugs!

742
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:06,280
- Prepare to bring her about, Mr. Nicholls.
- Aye-aye, Captain!

743
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,450
Prepare to bring her about!

744
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:21,970
Fire!

745
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,680
Portside gun, fire!

746
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,260
Look lively, lads!

747
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:48,030
- Mr. Nicholls, secure the cargo.
- Right you are, sir.

748
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:50,790
Prepare to repel all boarders!

749
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:29,910
This way! We need more men!

750
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,550
And then he saw him.

751
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:33,390
Like a phantom, rising from the dead.

752
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:35,810
Who?

753
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:38,980
Captain, who did he see?

754
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:42,560
It's gone.

755
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:46,480
What do you mean, gone?
What happened next?

756
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,900
By Jupiter, I have a beard!
Since when did I have a beard?

757
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,650
Captain, something happened
on the Unicorn.

758
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:57,320
It's the key to everything.
You must try to remember.

759
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:00,160
The Unicorn? What? I'm so terribly thirsty.

760
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,580
- Captain!
- Tintin!

761
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,630
What is happening to me?

762
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:15,180
And to think all it took was a day
in the Sahara.

763
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:19,100
Congratulations, Captain, you're sober.

764
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,300
Sober.

765
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:39,750
Good dog!

766
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,200
This one's alive.

767
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,290
- Check the other!
- Yes, sir.

768
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:51,590
Company, halt!

769
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:55,380
I'm Lieutenant Delcourt.
Welcome to the Afghar Outpost.

770
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,630
Thank you, Lieutenant. We owe you our lives.

771
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:03,010
- Did you find my friend?
- Yes, but he's not in good shape, I'm afraid.

772
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:07,560
He's still suffering the effects
of acute dehydration. He's quite delirious.

773
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:09,820
Why don't we pay him a visit?

774
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:12,860
Haddock! You're awake.

775
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:16,120
Good! I have a visitor for you.

776
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:18,280
- Captain?
- Hello!

777
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:20,080
I think you've got the wrong room.

778
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:23,490
Captain, it's Tintin.

779
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:26,080
Our plane crashed in the desert.
Don't you remember?

780
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:29,910
Plane? No, no, I'm a naval man myself.
I never fly if I can help it.

781
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:32,370
He's got me confused with someone else.

782
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:35,090
What is this peculiar liquid?

783
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:37,590
There's no bouquet.
It's completely transparent.

784
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:38,760
Why, it's water.

785
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:41,270
What will they think of next?

786
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:47,760
We suspect he has a concussion.
Heatstroke. Delirium.

787
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,430
He's sober.

788
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:52,020
Now, Captain, out in the desert...

789
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,520
- The desert?
- Yes. You were talking about Sir Francis.

790
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:56,940
- Sir who?
- Sir Francis.

791
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,300
And you were telling me
about what happened on the Unicorn.

792
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,450
- The unicorn!
- Yes!

793
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:04,110
The stuff that dreams are made of.

794
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:05,950
Wee children's dreams.

795
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:09,370
No, the ship.
Please try to remember, Captain.

796
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:11,130
Lives are at risk.

797
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:17,680
Snowy, what have you done?

798
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:23,930
I'd stand back if I were you.

799
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:29,690
Out! Everybody out of the room!

800
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,680
Snowy!

801
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:33,650
This man is insane!

802
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:44,080
Show yourself, Red Rackham!

803
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:53,620
If it's a fight you want,
you've met your match!

804
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:54,880
A fight with who?

805
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:58,550
To the death, Red Rackham!

806
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:22,950
No, wait!

807
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,410
Wait. Captain...

808
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:30,950
I remember everything now.

809
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:33,290
Everything Granddaddy told me.

810
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:36,880
The Unicorn was taken.

811
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:40,340
The pirates were now masters of the ship.

812
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,800
The crew surrendered?

813
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:47,810
Granddaddy said that Red Rackham
called Sir Francis the King's dog.

814
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:52,110
A pirate hunter sent to reclaim
their hard-won plunder.

815
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:57,940
Why would I waste my time on rum,
tobacco, molasses and dates

816
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:01,060
when you have
a more valuable cargo onboard?

817
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,660
Where is it?

818
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,320
You'll have to kill me first.

819
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:07,160
Not first, no.

820
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:08,450
Please.

821
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I'll start with your men.

822
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:16,080
To save his men,

823
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:19,080
he would give up the secret cargo.

824
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:20,680
And where was it?

825
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:44,570
Four hundredweight
of gold, jewels and treasure.

826
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,380
Kill his men!

827
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,500
No, Rackham! No!

828
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:02,970
Rackham, you gave me your word! Rackham!

829
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:04,900
Rackham!

830
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:11,380
Sir Francis knew he was doomed.

831
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:14,350
That he'd be hung from the highest yardarm.

832
01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:17,650
But they didn't reckon on one thing!

833
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:21,070
Sir Francis was a Haddock.

834
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:26,200
And a Haddock always has a trick
up his sleeve.

835
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:45,170
And with that, he hurls himself forward!

836
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:47,340
On the pirates? Like that? Unarmed?

837
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,260
No! No, on a bottle of rum
rolling on the deck.

838
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:53,680
And he opens it up,
and puts it to his lips, and...

839
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:55,010
And then he stops.

840
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:58,600
"This is no time for drinking," he says.
"I need all my wits about me."

841
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:01,600
With that, he puts down the bottle and...

842
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:03,230
Yes, yes, he puts down the bottle...

843
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:05,570
And he seizes a cutlass.

844
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:11,650
And then he makes his way
to the ship's magazine,

845
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:14,790
where they keep all the gunpowder
and the shot!

846
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:29,150
You dog!

847
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,720
You'd blow us sky high?

848
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:33,310
Come on, then.

849
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:35,940
Let's have you.

850
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,360
Not this time.

851
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:42,210
You!

852
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:44,380
Captain, what is it?

853
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:50,130
How could I be so blind?

854
01:09:50,230 --> 01:09:52,140
What are you talking about?

855
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:56,840
This isn't just about the scrolls or...

856
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:59,270
Or the treasure that went down with the ship.

857
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:02,400
It's me.

858
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:05,530
It's me he's after!

859
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:11,770
You'll suffer a curse upon you
and your name, Haddock.

860
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:13,740
He wants vengeance.

861
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:17,910
Come back and face me!

862
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,360
- Hurry, Tintin.
- What?

863
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,120
- We're out of time.
- Captain!

864
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:39,310
I curse you!

865
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:44,140
I curse your name and all who come after!

866
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,770
We will meet again, Haddock!

867
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:50,110
In another time! In another life!

868
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,210
It's not over. It was never over!

869
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,500
I don't understand. Who's after your blood?

870
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,800
- Sakharine!
- Sakharine? Why?

871
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:20,550
He's Red Rackham's descendent!
He means to finish it!

872
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:22,470
- That's why he did it.
- Did what?

873
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:26,510
Sank his own ship. Sir Francis sent
that treasure to the bottom of the sea.

874
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:28,820
He would be damned
before he let Red Rackham have it.

875
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:30,610
- And he was.
- But he couldn't let it lie.

876
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:32,190
- No.
- He left a clue.

877
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:35,150
Three clues wrapped in a riddle,
concealing a secret.

878
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:37,900
But only a true Haddock
would be able to solve it.

879
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,320
- What secret?
- The location.

880
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:43,240
To one of the greatest sunken treasures
in all history.

881
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:46,160
The wreck of the Unicorn.

882
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:50,170
He means to steal it! The third scroll!

883
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:53,750
Billions of blue, blistering barnacles!

884
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:58,680
I swear, as the last of the Haddocks,
I'll find that treasure before him!

885
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:01,210
To Bagghar.

886
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:23,960
He's here.

887
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:50,400
It's no good. They could be anywhere.

888
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:55,560
Captain.

889
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:58,160
Don't look now, but we're being followed.

890
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:02,030
Yes, we are.

891
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:08,530
What do you want?
Why are you following us?

892
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:11,490
Who are you working for?

893
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:13,000
Captain, stop! Stop!

894
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:15,830
- Thompson and Thomson.
- Not so loud.

895
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:18,080
- We're in disguise.
- So I see.

896
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:20,170
You got the message I sent from the ship?

897
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:22,670
Yes, well, bit of a long story, that.

898
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:25,170
The upshot is we caught the thief,
retrieved your wallet,

899
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:27,000
and then hopped on the next plane
to Bagghar.

900
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:30,010
Yes, that pocket picker
has picked his last pocket.

901
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:32,850
There. Don't worry.
He didn't take any money.

902
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:35,570
It's not the money I'm worried about.

903
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:41,660
The odds are even.

904
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,450
Now, to find the next two scrolls.

905
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:51,830
The Milanese Nightingale.

906
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:01,300
That's his secret weapon?

907
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,140
- My!
- My!

908
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:06,600
What a dish.

909
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:14,060
Enchanted, signora!

910
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:16,730
Benvenuto! Welcome! Marhaba!

911
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:19,650
We are blessed with your presence.

912
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:24,320
Yes. Indeed, Signor Salad!

913
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:27,080
What charming peasants.

914
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:30,910
May I introduce my escort,

915
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:34,170
Monsieur Shuggair Addeitiff.

916
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,420
He's been very

917
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,830
passionate in his support of this concert.

918
01:14:41,930 --> 01:14:45,250
It's my first visit to the Third World.

919
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:50,020
Please forgive me. I must escort madame
to her dressing room. Excuse us.

920
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,860
After you.

921
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:11,040
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello...

922
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:17,500
Here. I want you to look after this.

923
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:19,330
- What are you doing?
- Me?

924
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:21,170
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

925
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:23,460
If I'm caught,
I don't want them to find this on me.

926
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,800
Look, just keep it hidden.

927
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,800
I will guard this with my life!

928
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,060
Get up! Get up!

929
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:07,430
It's her!

930
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:02,650
Blistering barnacles!

931
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:05,610
What's that noise?

932
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:13,870
My ears,

933
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:17,290
- they're bleeding.
- No, they're not.

934
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:28,760
Captain.

935
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:33,350
Shut up, Snowy.

936
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,350
Oh, Columbus, it's every man for himself!
Make way.

937
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:45,940
Make way! Medical emergency.

938
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:08,880
That was close.

939
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:11,960
Hello, Captain.

940
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13,060
You!

941
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:50,380
Oh, no!

942
01:18:53,890 --> 01:18:55,220
Sakharine!

943
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:24,290
The falcon! Snowy, after him!

944
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:26,950
Tintin! Tintin!

945
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:29,910
Those two! There!
They're here to steal your ship!

946
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:31,420
No, no, no, no, no, we're not!

947
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,670
Arrest him! The ugly one!

948
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:35,210
- No, wait!
- Who, me?

949
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:36,310
Yes!

950
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,220
Thief! Arrest him!

951
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,410
Captain!

952
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:05,930
- Sakharine's got the scroll!
- It's worse than that.

953
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:09,660
- What do you mean?
- They took your scroll, Tintin. It's gone.

954
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,750
How? What happened?

955
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:13,710
It was Allan.

956
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:16,500
He knobbled me in the garden, and then

957
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,880
- there was a bottle of alcohol and...
- There always is.

958
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:21,350
No, no! No, not like that.

959
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,310
I can smell it on you.

960
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:34,570
Hurry. Back to the boat.

961
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:38,730
- Tintin! Where are you going?
- I'm going after Sakharine.

962
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:40,610
- By yourself?
- Yes!

963
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:42,200
Come on, Snowy!

964
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,670
Catch them, catch them!

965
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:03,180
Lose them! Get him off our tail!

966
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,240
Did you hit anything?

967
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:22,660
Oh, dear.

968
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,380
Faster, you idiot, faster!

969
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:38,090
Not again!

970
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,250
- I'll have those, thank you.
- Come on, Snowy!

971
01:21:41,350 --> 01:21:42,350
No!

972
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,720
Incoming falcon at four o'clock!

973
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,450
Tintin, faster!

974
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:05,950
- The scrolls!
- I got one, two...

975
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:07,290
And three!

976
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:09,870
Snowy!

977
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:21,300
Oh, no! Not again.

978
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:25,220
Come here, my beauty.

979
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:31,650
Ten thousand thundering typhoons!
Come here, you pilfering parakeet!

980
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:36,110
Captain, the bird! Grab it!

981
01:22:41,410 --> 01:22:43,910
Nice work, Snowy! Don't let him go!

982
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:54,630
You blue blistering barnacles!

983
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:58,090
Hang on, Snowy! Snowy, I'm coming!

984
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,210
There he is! Stop!

985
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:08,470
That's right, that's right, come to Daddy.

986
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:10,180
Come to Daddy.

987
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,350
Gotcha!

988
01:23:13,190 --> 01:23:14,190
No!

989
01:23:18,230 --> 01:23:20,030
Geronimo!

990
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:25,620
You double-dealing, pilfering parasites!

991
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:35,330
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

992
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:05,910
Gotcha!

993
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:12,860
The scrolls are lining up.

994
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,580
These are hidden numbers.

995
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,290
What does it say?

996
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:20,550
I wouldn't do that if I were you!

997
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:22,880
Let the bird go.

998
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:28,500
What do you value more,
those scrolls or Haddock's life?

999
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:29,670
Don't listen to him.

1000
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:32,130
You'll never get away with this,
you sour-faced sassonack!

1001
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:33,390
I will kill him.

1002
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:37,550
Don't worry about me, Tintin, I'm fine.

1003
01:24:37,650 --> 01:24:40,680
Let the bird go now, or this man dies!

1004
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:42,070
No! Wait!

1005
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:46,770
You two-timing troglodyte!
You simpering son of a po-faced profiteer!

1006
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:51,030
Perhaps we should put it to the test.
Here's mud in your eye.

1007
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:52,190
Fathead!

1008
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:53,540
Captain!

1009
01:25:19,610 --> 01:25:22,310
- We're saved!
- I love the beach.

1010
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:25,350
- You said you wanted a holiday.
- Quite.

1011
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:26,780
Very good.

1012
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:38,070
- Nobody takes my ship!
- They've already taken it.

1013
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:40,630
Nobody takes my ship twice!

1014
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,080
We'll show them, won't we, Tintin?
All right then, what's the plan?

1015
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:45,210
There is no plan.

1016
01:25:45,310 --> 01:25:47,500
Of course there's a plan.
You've always got a plan.

1017
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:48,680
Not this time.

1018
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:52,590
Sakharine has the scrolls.
They'll lead him to the treasure.

1019
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:56,020
It could be anywhere in the world.
We'll never see him again.

1020
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:58,350
It's over.

1021
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,180
I thought you were an optimist.

1022
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:05,430
Well, you were wrong, weren't you?
I'm a realist.

1023
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:07,850
That's just another name for a quitter.

1024
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:10,440
You can call me what you like.

1025
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:13,200
Don't you get it? We failed.

1026
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,330
"Failed."

1027
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:19,950
There are plenty of others
willing to call you a failure.

1028
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:24,330
A fool. A loser. A hopeless souse!

1029
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:27,510
Don't you ever say it of yourself.

1030
01:26:29,380 --> 01:26:33,460
You send out the wrong signal.
That is what people pick up.

1031
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:35,710
Do you understand?

1032
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:38,800
You care about something, you fight for it.

1033
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:42,060
You hit a wall, you push through it.

1034
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:46,980
There's something you need to know
about failure, Tintin.

1035
01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:53,910
You can never let it defeat you.

1036
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:56,690
What did you just say?

1037
01:26:56,790 --> 01:26:58,990
You hit a wall, you push through it.

1038
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:02,750
No, no, no, you said something
about sending out a signal.

1039
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:08,660
Of course! Captain!

1040
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:11,290
I sent a radio message from the Karaboudjan.

1041
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:13,470
I know what radio frequency
they're transmitting on.

1042
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:14,880
Well, how does that help us?

1043
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:17,180
All we have to do
is send that information to Interpol,

1044
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,770
they can track the signals
and figure out which way they're headed.

1045
01:27:19,870 --> 01:27:20,850
Here comes Interpol now.

1046
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:22,300
- Tintin!
- Tintin!

1047
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,770
Any port they enter we'll know at once.

1048
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:27,610
And we can get there first.

1049
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:43,410
What are we doing here, boss? I don't get it.
We're right back where we started.

1050
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:45,740
You're to speak of this to no one.
Keep your mouths shut.

1051
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:49,540
- Don't worry. As long as we get our share.
- You'll get your share.

1052
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,180
- Where are you going?
- Just guard the ship.

1053
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:52,240
Where's the filthy moolah?

1054
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:55,380
Good evening, sir.
I trust you had a successful trip abroad.

1055
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:58,010
Do I pay you to talk to me?

1056
01:27:58,110 --> 01:28:00,060
You don't pay me at all.

1057
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:03,890
What the blazes? Nestor!

1058
01:28:05,310 --> 01:28:06,480
Nestor!

1059
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:11,060
Tom! Allan!

1060
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:15,240
You blithering idiots, don't just stand there!
Do something!

1061
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:23,370
Caught him like a rat in a trap.

1062
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:26,660
Congratulations, gentlemen. He's all yours.

1063
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:30,910
Yes! We also have an arrest warrant issued
by both Interpol and the FBI.

1064
01:28:31,010 --> 01:28:32,960
- Your friend who got shot...
- Barnaby.

1065
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:35,900
...he was one of their agents.
Hot on Sakharine's trail from the start.

1066
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:37,670
It still doesn't make sense.

1067
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:40,050
He has the key to the treasure of the Unicorn,

1068
01:28:40,150 --> 01:28:42,930
which is sitting somewhere
on the ocean floor.

1069
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:44,640
Why would he come back home?

1070
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,560
Right.

1071
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:51,730
- Sakharine?
- Sakharine?

1072
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:54,030
That's Mr. Sakharine to you.

1073
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:55,900
Hold it.

1074
01:29:02,620 --> 01:29:03,780
- Look out!
- What...

1075
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,080
Oh, no!

1076
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:12,710
Allan! Allan, get me down!

1077
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:18,090
What? Not that way!

1078
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:24,890
Not that way, you fool, the other way!

1079
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:37,230
Right.

1080
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:06,730
Look out!

1081
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:27,620
Good Lord! Come on!

1082
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:37,800
Close but no cigar!

1083
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:22,250
- Red Rackham!
- That's right. My ancestor.

1084
01:31:22,350 --> 01:31:24,250
Just as Sir Francis was yours.

1085
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:25,800
Unfinished business.

1086
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:30,230
I'm glad you know the truth, Haddock.
Until you could remember,

1087
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:33,770
killing you
wouldn't have been this much fun.

1088
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:03,010
Who gave you permission to board my ship?

1089
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:05,130
I don't need it.

1090
01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:06,800
I've never needed it.

1091
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:13,410
The legend says only a Haddock
can discover the secret of the Unicorn,

1092
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:17,990
but it took a Rackham to get the job done.

1093
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:20,290
So you've lost again, Haddock.

1094
01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:24,040
That's right. Why don't you have a drink?

1095
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:26,540
That's all you've got left, isn't it?

1096
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:30,390
Everything that was rightfully yours
is now mine.

1097
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,430
Including this ship.

1098
01:33:38,150 --> 01:33:42,570
Thundering typhoons.
Nobody takes my ship.

1099
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:04,170
We have you now, you devil.

1100
01:34:05,130 --> 01:34:07,720
- You are under arrest.
- To be precise,

1101
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:09,930
you are under arrest.

1102
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:25,780
Do you see?

1103
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:31,150
Blistering barnacles, they're coordinates.

1104
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:35,440
- It took all three scrolls to form the numbers.
- Latitude and longitude.

1105
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:38,710
That is it. That's the location of the treasure.

1106
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:44,380
We did it!

1107
01:34:55,430 --> 01:34:58,630
Almost there, Mr. Tintin!

1108
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:00,640
A nudge to starboard should do it.

1109
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:04,010
- Are you sure we're on course?
- Trust me, laddie.

1110
01:35:04,110 --> 01:35:07,150
I know these parts like the back of my hand.

1111
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:10,980
Starboard! Quickly! Quickly!

1112
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:13,320
Aye, Captain, starboard it is!

1113
01:35:20,790 --> 01:35:22,540
All stop!

1114
01:35:28,710 --> 01:35:31,830
Marlinspike Hall.

1115
01:35:31,930 --> 01:35:34,180
Those coordinates lead here.

1116
01:35:35,010 --> 01:35:37,220
And this is where Sir Francis hid it?

1117
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,970
I thought the treasure went down
with the ship.

1118
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:45,060
Master Haddock, Mr. Tintin,
I've been expecting you.

1119
01:35:47,270 --> 01:35:49,640
Welcome to Marlinspike Hall.

1120
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:51,730
Will you look at this place?

1121
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:54,860
I don't think it's changed at all
since I was a wee boy.

1122
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,440
And may I say, sir,
how much I'm looking forward

1123
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:59,940
to having a Haddock
back in charge of the estate.

1124
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:04,820
You'll be waiting a long time, Nestor.
There's no way I could afford to live here!

1125
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:07,870
Well, Captain, you know the house.

1126
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:09,630
Where do we start?

1127
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:12,090
Is the cellar still here?

1128
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:24,220
No, no, no, no, this isn't it.

1129
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,430
I meant the other cellar.

1130
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:28,400
I'm sorry, sir, there is no "other cellar."

1131
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:30,320
It was bigger than this.

1132
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:31,640
Snowy.

1133
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:34,200
Snowy, where are you?

1134
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:36,110
No, Hector.

1135
01:36:38,870 --> 01:36:39,940
Hector.

1136
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:41,660
Captain, help me.

1137
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,340
Heel, boy.

1138
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:53,550
Snowy?

1139
01:36:56,970 --> 01:36:58,390
Just like you said, Captain.

1140
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:01,010
You hit a wall...

1141
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:03,850
...you push through it.

1142
01:37:08,690 --> 01:37:11,350
My grandfather must have walled it up
before he lost the house.

1143
01:37:11,450 --> 01:37:14,360
"And then shines forth the Eagle's Cross."

1144
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:24,900
Well, I can see the cross,
but where's the eagle?

1145
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,620
St. John the Evangelist,

1146
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:29,620
who was always depicted with an eagle.

1147
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:31,750
And he's called the Eagle of Patmos.

1148
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:34,090
He is the eagle.

1149
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:39,540
What's he trying to tell us, Captain?

1150
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:41,140
I'm at a loss.

1151
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:44,930
That island, the one in the middle,
that doesn't exist.

1152
01:37:45,430 --> 01:37:46,510
How do you know?

1153
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:49,180
Because I've sailed those waters
countless times.

1154
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,810
I've been there. It's a mistake.

1155
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:56,780
What if it isn't?

1156
01:37:58,450 --> 01:38:02,530
Sir Francis wanted his inheritance
to go to a man who was worthy of it.

1157
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:08,660
A man like himself, who knows the seas
like the back of his hand.

1158
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:12,160
A man who could look at a globe

1159
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:15,500
and tell if one tiny island

1160
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,260
was out of place.

1161
01:38:30,770 --> 01:38:32,770
Blistering treasure.

1162
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:36,280
It's Red Rackham's barnacles!

1163
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:43,780
What is this?

1164
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:28,070
Just a wee tipple.

1165
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:31,210
A toast to our good fortune.

1166
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:34,870
That's better.

1167
01:39:34,970 --> 01:39:36,470
It's odd, really. You would've thought,

1168
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:38,730
after all the fuss and bother,
there would've been more.

1169
01:39:38,830 --> 01:39:41,330
- More of what?
- Red Rackham's treasure.

1170
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:45,630
I mean, by your account, he looted
half of South America. I just thought...

1171
01:39:45,730 --> 01:39:48,470
Never mind. There's plenty to go around.

1172
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:52,300
It's a funny old life, eh?

1173
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:55,640
Well, you've got your story
for your newspaper.

1174
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:57,770
All's well that ends well.

1175
01:39:57,870 --> 01:40:00,020
It's not ended.

1176
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:03,230
Sir Francis left another clue
at the bottom of the globe.

1177
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:06,980
- A clue to what?
- Four hundredweight of gold,

1178
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:09,620
just lying at the bottom of the sea.

1179
01:40:10,370 --> 01:40:13,400
How's your thirst for adventure, Captain?

1180
01:40:15,330 --> 01:40:17,990
Unquenchable, Tintin.

1180
01:40:18,305 --> 01:40:24,733
