1
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:15,568
When I first started safecrackina,
I used to rip into them.

2
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:21,042
Pour in the soup and blow the shit
out of them. It was like rape.

3
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:26,044
It had this sexual theme
runnina throuah it. I used to...

4
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:30,528
...blow them open and plunae riaht in.

5
00:00:30,729 --> 00:00:34,119
Often, I was sexually
aroused at the time.

6
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:40,080
But as I became more proficient,
I learned to sneak up on them.

7
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:42,445
Ferret out their secrets.

8
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:46,648
I used to have them open
before they even knew I was there.

9
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:50,524
It was more like
seduction than rape.

10
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:55,126
The beauty of it was, I was fallina
in love with the whole thina.

11
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,245
ln love?

12
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:02,079
l take it you were fixating
on safecracking as a displacement...

13
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,765
...of normal sexual relations.

14
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:08,807
Tell me, how was your love life
at that time?

15
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:13,082
Just like any other guy.
l was looking.

16
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:16,719
Looking f or what?

17
00:01:18,449 --> 00:01:21,839
-Love.
-Love. And what is love?

18
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:25,639
He was looking f or something
deeper, more lasting.

19
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:29,040
Something more than just nookie.

20
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:30,637
That's valid.

21
00:01:30,889 --> 00:01:34,120
Time is getting short
and we've got a graduate.

22
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:37,605
Anderson is about to leave us
after ten years.

23
00:01:37,809 --> 00:01:41,040
How does the group feel about that?

24
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,878
That's an outpouring of real feeling.
How do you feel about it, Duke?

25
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:53,645
-Are you sure you wanna know?
-Well, that's what we're here f or.

26
00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:57,040
-Angry.
-Why is that?

27
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:02,363
-They grabbed ten years of my life.
-You knew the law. You took a chance.

28
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:04,446
Who are you angry at?

29
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:09,364
Those sons of bitches that cut
a piece out of this country every day.

30
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:13,488
Do you characterize their actions
as similar to yours?

31
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:17,278
Damn right. What's advertising
but a legalized con game?

32
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:22,239
What the hell's marriage? Prostitution
with a government stamp on it.

33
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:25,481
What is your stock market?
A fix ed horse race.

34
00:02:25,649 --> 00:02:29,437
Some business guy steals a bank,
he's a big success story.

35
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:33,318
Some other guy steals
a magazine, and he's busted.

36
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:36,965
Well, f or my part
l feel deeply moved.

37
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:41,560
Knowing that he trusts me enough
to say things he really feels.

38
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:45,688
Saying those things, which l
as a prison official, could--

39
00:02:45,929 --> 00:02:49,046
You can't do shit!

40
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:53,646
l'm not on parole, l'm finished here.
There's nothing you can do.

-Well, didn't you get any mail?
-Who did you write to?

67
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:11,884
My sister, she was the last one.

68
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:16,884
She must've died, because the last thing
l got f rom her, an Easter card.

-l got that in 1948.

Okay, what is this?

A red hot woman.

116
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:43,844
lf l was a red hot woman,
you wouldn't want me.

117

You wouldn't have the feeling

Werner? lt's lngrid. l'm af raid

Poor Werner. You know, he just
doesn't know who he is.

130
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:42,840

Now?

139
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:25,163
-You're always so serious.
-l have no sense of humour. None.

140
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:31,080
You want a $1500 advance to finance
research, lay the caper out, et cetera.

141
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:34,844
-Let me explain what l'm going to do.
-Don't interrupt.

142
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:39,645
Don't talk to me like that.
l don't give a goddamn who you are now.

143
00:14:39,849 --> 00:14:42,647
lt's all right.
Angelo is just in a hurry.

144
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:45,483
He's got a lot on his mind.

145
00:14:45,729 --> 00:14:50,280
l'm sorry, Duke. Nick's right.

Nick's riaht, I aot a lot on my mind.

147
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:56,964
They call him Duke Anderson.
He was telling these guys--

148
00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:00,281
We don't care about him.
Who's the other guy?

149
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:04,488
l told you Treasury Department
guys 100 times.

150
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:07,289
Hat, the kid. His f ather was the Hook.

151
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:13,206
But when he was knocked over in Vegas,
the old man, Papa Angelo, adopted him.

152
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:20,361
l got a lot on my mind.
How's everything with lmmigration?

153
00:15:20,609 --> 00:15:21,758
Ask him.

154
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:26,764
With the appeals and everything,
Duke's got at least nine months.

155
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:30,245
Duke's aot at least nine months.

156
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:35,847
-That's D'Medico, the lawyer.
-That's right.

157
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:39,443
Duke's got at least nine months.

158
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:42,368
What do we get out
of these apartments?

159
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:46,767
A f urniture van f ull of stuff.
From Picasso paintings to stones--

160
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,362
Oh, Christ.

161
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:52,807
-What do you want?
-Cash. Bills, that's what you want.

162
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:57,446
-There's cash there.
-Maybe l clear 25, 000.

163
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:59,361
Twenty-five.

164
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:03,162
-Do l hear 20?
-l think we'll do better.

165
00:16:03,369 --> 00:16:06,600
-How much better?
-l'm counting on this to put me out.

166
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:08,725
-l want a stake.
-A stake f or what?

167
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:12,248
l want to be a sponge fisherman.

168
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:17,278
Up at 5:30, raw fish f or breakf ast.
Out in the boats by 6:00.

169
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:20,248
By 6:30, diving f or sponges.

170
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:23,126
Hey, what's sponges?

171
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:27,840
You are not a fisherman.
You're a goddamn burglar.

172
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:31,885
l want to be a rich burglar.

173
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:34,483
What do you think?

174
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:38,768
lt stinks. What are we screwing
around with stuff like this?

175
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:44,686
Even if he scores, it's less than one
week's take in our worst horse room.

176
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:48,560
l don't know.
He's a good dependable guy.

177
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:53,519
He saved Gino's life. l think
we owe it to listen to him.

178
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:57,079
This guy's more than muscle.
Every move is laid out.

179
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:01,845
lt's like a military operation.
Not like the old days.

180
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,446
Hey, the old days, huh?
You still think you can take me?

181
00:17:07,649 --> 00:17:12,086
Come on, l'm in pretty good shape.

182
00:17:16,729 --> 00:17:21,245
Hey, look at me, Vic.
l'm a businessman.

183
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:24,642
My gut is swelling.
My ass is dropping.

184
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:29,047
l got a wife and three kids.
l belong to f our clubs.

185
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:35,559
l worry about the crabgrass in the
lawn and worms in the goddamn poodle.

186
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:40,039
lt ain't right.

187
00:17:41,129 --> 00:17:43,848
Man's a hunting animal.

188
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:49,728
-lt ain't natural to be an accountant.
-Here's your linguine, Mr. Angelo.

189
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:35,283
''An FBl request f or a wiretap

-An interior decorator's.

-Hey, Tommy, somebody here to see you.
-Oh, God, what is--?

199
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,440
Duke?

200
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:24,438
Duke.

201
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:33,640
You've come to tell me
you've had the operation.

202
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:36,761
Duke, look at you, dear boy.

203
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:39,244
You should be so lucky.

204
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:42,685
Don't get snippy with me, you bitch.

205
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:45,045
Come in the back.

206
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:49,078
-Can we talk?
-That's all you ever want to do.

207
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:51,718
Here, perch.

208
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:54,238
Some tea?

209
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:59,081
Tommy, l got a whole building
that l want combed out.

210
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:01,757
What? Of course you do.

211
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:06,004
lt's got a doctor's office.
Six flats, two to a floor.

212
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:12,559
l want schedules of services, hours
and names of maids, doormen. The works.

213
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:15,442
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

214
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:19,683
You don't want one or two flats,
you want the whole thing?

215
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:22,045
That's right.

216
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:29,923
Five hundred f or now.

217
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:35,044
Well, Duke, l haven't seen it,
and l just don't like to rush into it.

218
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:36,847
Five hundred f or now.

219
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:40,877
Give me the address
and l'll figure out how to get in.

220
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:43,438
Five hundred.

221
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:51,039
Two sugars, right? l remembered.

222
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:56,480
When l see the size and shape
of it, and how to handle it...

223
00:20:56,729 --> 00:21:00,039
...l'll let you know
what the price is.

224
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:04,168
lt's five hundred.

225
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:08,208
Everything you say sounds
like five hundred. How was prison?

226
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:10,447
Okay.

227
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:14,608
Hey, Tommy, the phones are all fix ed!

228
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:17,528
Oh, God, what do l know about that?

229
00:21:17,689 --> 00:21:22,638
l hope you cleaned up after yourselves
like good little telephone men.

230
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,877
Meet anybody interesting
in your cell?

231
00:21:36,449 --> 00:21:38,041
Kid.

232
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:40,918
Did l scare you?

233
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:44,041
You? No.

234
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:52,440
l got a caper laid out.
You wanna come?

235
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:58,046
You're one of those criminals
that corrupts younger offenders.

236
00:21:58,209 --> 00:22:01,485
l need you to bridge burglar
alarms, open doors...

237
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:04,960
...cut some telephone circuits.
Now you can do that.

238
00:22:05,209 --> 00:22:07,928
Your piece will set you up in business.

239
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:11,758
What? So some son of a bitch
can come steal me blind?

240
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:14,358
So you claim burglary insurance.

241
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:17,569
l don't know. l was in f or dope, see?

242
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:22,599
Some guys, you put them right out
of business, you rip off their stuff.

243
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:26,882
lf a guy's not smart enough
to get insurance...

244
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:30,883
...l'm just the hand of f ate.
He's gonna lose it anyway.

245
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:34,246
ls it right to steal
f rom insurance companies?

246
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:39,159
When you go rob a guy who's got
insurance, you're doing him a f avour.

247
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:42,082
You give him
a little ex citement, a story.

248
00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:45,878
He becomes more interesting
because you robbed him.

249
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:49,883
The publicity gets people
to buy insurance.

250
00:22:50,129 --> 00:22:55,442
You do the f uzz a f avour because you
prove they're deserving of a pay boost.

251
00:22:55,689 --> 00:22:59,318
And you do yourself a f avour
because you need the dough.

252
00:22:59,489 --> 00:23:03,448
-Do you believe that?
-lt's bullshit. lt's just dog eat dog.

253
00:23:03,689 --> 00:23:07,443
-But l want the first bite.
-That's my man. Okay.

254
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:17,247
Hey, Kid, don't you want
to know what your cut is?

255
00:23:17,449 --> 00:23:20,247
l trust you. You lay what
you can on me:

256
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:21,643
Okay.

257
00:23:22,729 --> 00:23:25,766
'' Kid, don't you want
to know what your cut is?''

258
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:30,844
The other guy says, '' l trust you.
You lay what you can on me.''

259
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:36,923
We don't need the audio bug.

260
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:40,280
Let's pull it bef ore
somebody finds it.

261
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:45,239
lf the kid is still on narcotics,
the visual surveillance is good enough.

262
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:49,162

...late 30s, early 40s...

267
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:37,761
...entered the rooms above
the subject premises...

268
00:24:37,969 --> 00:24:41,086
...occupied by Edward Spencer,
a nonpolitical.

269
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:43,126
Hey, hey.

270
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:46,042
-Spencer?
-Who's that?

271
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:50,168
You don't know me, but I was
tiaht with Billy Maitland.

272
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:58,238
-Maitland is dead.
-l was there when they gave it to him.

273
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:04,886
l know you. l seen you
in the slam, five years ago.

274
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,563
l just got out.

275
00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:16,323
-What did those bastards do to Billy?
-lt wasn't the screws.

276
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:18,201
A prison-yard scrap.

277
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:21,484
One of those things.
How's it going?

278
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:25,443
Don't sit down,
l'm on my way out right now.

279
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:31,438
-l got a job laid out.
-Yeah?

280
00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:33,367
l need a good driver.

281
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:37,682
Let's take it f or granted
you need me, or you wouldn't be here.

282
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:40,045
l'm in demand.

283
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:43,446
Fella here last week
figuring a Brink's truck.

284
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:48,888
He spent months f ollowing that truck,
getting to know the driver, the crew.

285
00:25:49,129 --> 00:25:53,964
Hell, he even laid the driver's
wife's sister, setting the thing up.

286
00:25:54,209 --> 00:25:58,487
He walks out of here after talking
to me, and what happens?

287
00:25:58,729 --> 00:26:02,961
The Brink's driver gets drunk,
beats up his wife...

288
00:26:03,209 --> 00:26:07,521
...gets into a beef
with the cops and got fired.

289
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:12,365
So this chap is back to square one,
figuring it all out, but not with me.

290
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:16,960
What l'm saying to you is that
Spencer is laying very low...

291
00:26:17,129 --> 00:26:23,477
...playing it very cool, because l got
the bread to wait f or the right thing.

292
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:28,048
l'll pay you a flat 2000
to drive f or me.

293
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:32,447
lf it's worth my time,
it's worth a percentage.

294
00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:35,766
-How much do you figure to score?
-l don't know.

295
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:38,648
Enough to f urnish this place.

296
00:26:53,249 --> 00:26:54,762
-Are you O'Leary?
-Yes.

297
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:56,681
l'm Sydney Brevoort.

298
00:26:56,849 --> 00:27:00,080
Management has decided
to redecorate the halls.

299
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:03,565
-l'm here to survey the tenants.
-l don't know.

300
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:05,367
-Well--
-Hold it a second.

301
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:07,287
-What is it?
-Meter man.

302
00:27:07,489 --> 00:27:11,164
-Here's my card.
-l don't know anything about it.

303
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:14,128
-Hold it! Hey, you!
-You talking to me?

304
00:27:14,329 --> 00:27:19,881
-Yeah, where do you think you're going?
-l got a delivery of this f ur coat.

305
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:24,759
-Apartment 2B, Miss Everleigh.
-You come back here and wait.

306
00:27:24,969 --> 00:27:27,244
l can only deliver to Mrs. Everleigh.

307
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:30,282
Don't give me any shit.
Stand over there.

308
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:32,639
-Come on, chief, let's go.
-What?

309
00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:36,637
l'm sorry, but l only have
this afternoon to survey.

310
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:40,364
-The manager's got to clear it.
-But it's very simple.

311
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:44,158
You have my card, there's
the number, call the office.

312
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:49,558
l ask the tenants what colours
they want in their halls.

313
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:54,883
lt's not as if you don't know me.
l mean, you do have my identification.

314
00:27:56,249 --> 00:28:00,083
-Afternoon, Antiques lnternational.
-One East 91st Street.

315
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:03,838
We got a guy here says
he's f rom your business.

316
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:06,398
-Yes?
-You got a Sydney Brevoort?

317
00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:11,127
-What do you want to know?
-It's a matter of identification.

318
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:13,843
What does he look like?

319
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:20,484
-He's about 45, a little chunky, f ag.
-That's him.

320
00:28:20,729 --> 00:28:22,447
Okay, thanks.

321
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:26,648
-All right, you can go up.
-Thanks, l'll start on the second--

322
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:28,128
Hey, hey.

323
00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:33,449
-Hey, what's happening, baby?
-Let's see the invoice.

324
00:28:36,689 --> 00:28:41,285
-'' Everleigh, Apartment 2B.''
-You got it. l think you've got it.

325
00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:43,838
Hold it.

326
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:02,887
How do you do, Mrs. Horowitz?
l'm the decorator f or the building.

327
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:07,484
Oh, my God, you're not
putting that in dishwater?

328
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:09,481
-Do you have the rest?
-The rest?

329
00:29:09,729 --> 00:29:15,361
lt's the old-f ashioned set that someone
who loves beautif ul things would have.

330
00:29:15,569 --> 00:29:18,879
You know, Mrs. Horowitz,
jewellers just don't know.

331
00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:23,919
They melt down these old settings,
and they end up in people's cavities.

332
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:29,647
You must come to my shop. l have
the kind of place where someone....

333
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:41,118
-Sorry, were you expecting this here?
-Everleigh, 2B.

334
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:45,840
They said you might want to try it on
in case it wasn't a good fit.

335
00:29:47,449 --> 00:29:52,239
-Duke, did you do this?
-l thought you'd like it, so l got it.

336
00:29:52,449 --> 00:29:54,246
Try it on.

337
00:29:54,649 --> 00:29:58,437
-Thank you, O'Leary.
-l'll stay with him.

338
00:30:21,249 --> 00:30:24,639
-ls it real?
-Sure.

339
00:30:26,689 --> 00:30:28,964
What are you up to, you bastard?

340
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:32,644
-You didn't want to know.
-l don't. Can l keep it?

341
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:37,445
Sure, it was a necessary
expense anyway:

342
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:43,438
Sit down, l want to show you
how gratef ul l am.

343
00:30:53,209 --> 00:30:58,647
-lt's your sweetness that gets me.
-You can always turn it down.

344
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:03,679
-Or l can send you a thank-you note.
-l never turn anything down. Never.

345
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:08,525
-lt's just another that l owe you.
-Don't keep count.

346
00:31:08,729 --> 00:31:11,846
By now, things
can never be evened out.

347
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:17,043
-And what about them outside?
-What about them?

348
00:31:17,489 --> 00:31:22,085
-l gotta keep that doorman up here.
-That's up to you.

349
00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:25,685
-What if l make a noise?
-They'll think we're balling.

350
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:27,647
Make them happy.

351
00:31:44,889 --> 00:31:47,847
Now we should be able
to match the hallway.

352
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:53,243
lf l could come in, perhaps we could
get an idea of the colours you prefer.

353
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:24,520
The management has sent me over
to see about redecorating your hall.

354
00:32:24,689 --> 00:32:27,522
-l'll give you my husband. Carl.
-Yes.

355
00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:29,685
-Sorry to disturb you.
-Yes.

356
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:31,885
-l'm Sydney Brevoort.
-Hi.

357
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:05,563
l've come to decorate your halls.

358
00:33:06,449 --> 00:33:09,646
And not a moment too soon.

359
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:11,557
Thank you.

360
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:26,918
-You're gonna answer it, are you?
-Business bef ore pleasure.

361
00:33:27,129 --> 00:33:28,881
Hello?

362
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:32,246
Yeah. For you.

363
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:37,241
-Hello?
-Hey, Duke, how are you?

364
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:40,885
-Who's this?
-Pop, I aot your number from the kid.

365
00:33:41,129 --> 00:33:45,566
-Pop, how are you making out?
-Terrific, terrific.

366
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:48,846
Hey, Duke, could l come
and live with you?

367
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:53,442
See, l'm living with my sister.
She's got these f our kids...

368
00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:58,245
...her husband's got this bad back.
Listen, are you okay f or bread?

369
00:33:58,489 --> 00:34:01,879
-You aot a place to live?
-Yeah, don't worry about me.

370
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:05,240
I'll see you. The kid
knows where to find me.

371
00:34:05,449 --> 00:34:08,043
Pop, hang on a minute.

372
00:34:08,289 --> 00:34:12,680
-Something's up, are you interested?
-With you, Duke? Anytime.

373
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:18,885
-The tougher the better.
-Okay, look, I'll aet back to you.

374
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:25,198
Anytime. Everything's terrific.
l'm sorry about your sister. So long.

375
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:02,843
-Hello, Duke.
-Hi. How are you, Pat?

376
00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:05,287
Not so good.

377
00:35:41,489 --> 00:35:43,559
We're on them, loud and clear.

378
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:49,642
lnternal Revenue Service surveillance,
Pat Angelo, 8-12-70.

379
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:56,163
Case 642DZ713.
Subject with unidentified male, white.

380
00:35:59,009 --> 00:36:00,567
How does it look?

381
00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:04,728
100 percent.
My bird dog, he knows his stuff.

382
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,648
He says paintings
will go half a million.

383
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:10,886
There's a safe f ull of cash
held f rom tax es.

384
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:14,764
There's diamonds and jewellery that
they loan to museums.

385
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:20,965
l can do it. l need some muscle,
some technical help. And $1700.

386
00:36:21,169 --> 00:36:23,478
-You've been away nine years.
-Ten.

387
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:27,364
The country's changed.
They got a new breed of cop.

388
00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:32,768
People have alarms, guns. Dogs. They
breed Dobermans to tear you apart.

389
00:36:33,249 --> 00:36:37,686
Realtors advertise these places.
24-hour-a-day armed guards.

390
00:36:37,889 --> 00:36:41,359
You gotta sign in and out.
Some places got moats.

391
00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:44,129
-Papa Angelo owes it to me.
-He owes it.

392
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:47,048
He owes you 20 years
f or saving his kid?

393
00:36:47,249 --> 00:36:52,277
l've laid it out. Labor Day weekend.
People are away, the streets are empty.

394
00:36:52,649 --> 00:36:55,447
You have got it worked out
pretty good.

395
00:36:56,929 --> 00:37:01,639
On the way back f rom the f uneral,
l'll stop at Papa's and check it out.

396
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:19,683
Wait in the car. l'll talk
to the old man. He runs things.

397
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:23,245
-89 and he still calls the shots.
-l need $1700.

398
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:27,806
You never know, he's f ull of
surprises. 89 and f ull of surprises.

399
00:37:40,409 --> 00:37:42,559
ls that you, Gino?

400
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:46,679
No, Papa, it's me, Angelo.

401
00:37:49,129 --> 00:37:55,602
Gino's kid broke a tooth.
And l sent my doctor to Miami.

402
00:37:57,889 --> 00:38:02,724
Gino's kid is 32 years old, Papa.
He's got kids of his own.

403
00:38:06,209 --> 00:38:08,279
What are we gonna do, Papa?

404
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:11,642
This Anderson claims a debt of honour.

405
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:17,363
lt's too complex, too many people.
We don't need it.

406
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:22,563
We're in linen supplies, restaurants,
wholesale meat, everything.

407
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:25,602
lt's stupid, this bang-bang stuff.

408
00:38:31,049 --> 00:38:34,405
What am l talking it down f or?
Maybe he can make it.

409
00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:39,285
Why am l looking at the dark side?
Why can't l once say a positive word?

410
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:41,081
l'm always knocking.

411
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:44,002
That's not happiness.

412
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:50,489
This caper is so ex citing.

413
00:38:52,529 --> 00:38:53,848
Papa?

414
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,318
Are you tired of living?

415
00:39:12,129 --> 00:39:14,279
Would you like to die?

416
00:39:19,009 --> 00:39:23,366
All right, so this Anderson caper
is gonna be a disaster.

417
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:27,164
How are you going to beat the police
on this thing?

418
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:28,683
lt won't hurt.

419
00:39:31,729 --> 00:39:34,038
lt'll help maintain the image.

420
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:39,765
Let the businessmen and politicians
fear us, we're men who carry guns.

421
00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:44,759
Will they argue a laundry contract?
Ref use a garbage-hauling contract?

422
00:39:45,409 --> 00:39:50,847
l hope this thing f alls on page one,
and not page five.

423
00:39:55,489 --> 00:39:56,968
Thank you, Papa.

424
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:04,601
Papa's sorry, he was all tied up.
He couldn't see you personally.

425
00:40:05,009 --> 00:40:06,647
He okayed the deal.

426
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:11,283
We'll give you the money f or
the finance, we want 60I40.

427
00:40:11,529 --> 00:40:12,928
50I50.

428
00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:19,317
50I50. We want you to take one
of our boys along.

429
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:20,962
That's okay.

430
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:24,764
You don't know the whole deal.
We want you to burn him.

431
00:40:27,689 --> 00:40:29,168
Burn him?

432
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:32,929
He's done his duty, he's sloppy.

433
00:40:33,129 --> 00:40:36,041
He leaves bodies around.
We want him out.

434
00:40:36,249 --> 00:40:38,922
The job is already complicated enough.

435
00:40:39,129 --> 00:40:45,284
You came to me. l didn't ask you. lt's
a little negotiation, don't get sore.

436
00:40:48,169 --> 00:40:49,443
Inarid.

437
00:40:51,689 --> 00:40:53,361
lngrid.

438
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,961
Shut up.

439
00:40:57,169 --> 00:41:00,764
You made it. Don't fight it anymore.

440
00:41:02,689 --> 00:41:04,407
What was it like?

441
00:41:06,209 --> 00:41:09,406
l don't know. l was scared.

442
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:11,566
What, during?

443
00:41:13,649 --> 00:41:15,128
l don't know.

444
00:41:15,929 --> 00:41:17,999
What were you scared of?

445
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:21,083
-l don't wanna talk about it.
-What?

446
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:25,407
l hated it.
l lost control and l hated it.

447
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:31,844
What are you so happy about?

448
00:41:35,009 --> 00:41:38,684
Things are looking up.
The signs are good.

449
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:45,518
l hate being a woman. Men!
You're hairy, vain and overbearing.

450
00:41:46,049 --> 00:41:52,522
l bet you think l'll crawl and beg you
to pet me like a drooly little dog.

451
00:41:52,729 --> 00:41:55,368
l don't know why
l ever had to meet you.

452
00:41:55,569 --> 00:41:59,608
To give me the chance to start
evening things up.

453
00:42:03,329 --> 00:42:04,728
Okay?

454
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:42,720
For chrissake, what is this?
lt's hot in here.

455
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:46,001
Parelli? l'm Anderson.

456
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:53,406
l can't stay in here. lt's gonna take
the press out of my clothes.

457
00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:56,726
Take them off.
You can get a towel outside.

458
00:42:58,249 --> 00:43:00,205
You're out of your mind.

459
00:43:01,209 --> 00:43:02,847
You suit yourself.

460
00:43:03,209 --> 00:43:07,885
Any guy who wants to stay in here
with his suit on has got to be crazy.

461
00:43:08,089 --> 00:43:10,603
-What is this--?
-You'll do this my way.

462
00:43:25,449 --> 00:43:28,964
lf it wasn't f or Pat Angelo,
l would never be here.

463
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,082
Do you go armed?

464
00:43:34,049 --> 00:43:35,687
Always.

465
00:43:36,209 --> 00:43:37,961
Ever killed anyone?

466
00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:40,648
Yeah.

467
00:43:41,929 --> 00:43:43,840
lt doesn't bother you?

468
00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:47,761
Well, you see...

469
00:43:48,649 --> 00:43:50,719
...none of them was f riends.

470
00:43:52,649 --> 00:43:56,085
ln f act, none of them
was even f rom my hometown.

471
00:44:01,969 --> 00:44:03,766
What do you think?

472
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:05,642
l don't know.

473
00:44:06,569 --> 00:44:08,924
We want you to snuff him quietly.

474
00:44:09,129 --> 00:44:14,681
Why do you say ''snuffed, offed, knocked
out, rubbed out, deceased, passed on''?

475
00:44:14,889 --> 00:44:16,880
Why not, '' kill him''?

476
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:20,160
ls it so hard?

477
00:44:21,129 --> 00:44:22,448
Duke.

478
00:44:26,889 --> 00:44:30,484
l like you, Duke, but l want to give
you some advice.

479
00:44:30,689 --> 00:44:33,601
Parelli's tough and mean.

480
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:38,600
Unless you are very firm with this,
he's going to be ahead of you.

481
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:43,644
l would hate to have to explain to him
what happened, if he killed you.

482
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:46,443
You understand my dilemma.

483
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:50,920
-lf l don't, somebody else will, right?
-Right.

484
00:44:51,129 --> 00:44:54,201
He's already dead.
l could look at it that way.

485
00:44:54,409 --> 00:44:56,843
You could look at it that way.

486
00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:06,164
The other guys, they'll just
have to go along with it.

487
00:45:17,529 --> 00:45:19,167
Win or lose...

488
00:45:20,409 --> 00:45:21,922
...it's a contract.

489
00:45:26,209 --> 00:45:27,608
Okay, Pete.

490
00:45:33,809 --> 00:45:40,282
3:45 p.m., unidentified male Caucasian
present at previous meeting at 8870.

491
00:45:40,889 --> 00:45:45,167
At which matters of a nonpolitical
nature were discussed.

492
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:50,648
One unidentified male, sex deviate,
white, about 45.

493
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:54,808
One unidentified male,
white and in early 20s.

494
00:45:55,009 --> 00:45:57,967
And one unidentified male,
black, in late 20s.

495
00:46:03,129 --> 00:46:05,199
This is Jimmy l told you about.

496
00:46:05,409 --> 00:46:08,958
Forget names.
We don't know each other, and won't.

497
00:46:09,169 --> 00:46:11,763
-What a shame.
-That ain't his real name.

498
00:46:11,929 --> 00:46:12,918
Okay.

499
00:46:13,489 --> 00:46:19,485
He's the bird dog. He'll mark what's
valuable. All in a small bag.

500
00:46:19,689 --> 00:46:23,921
Anything with an alarm, lock, safe,
whatever, the Kid will fix.

501
00:46:27,569 --> 00:46:29,241
This is Socks.

502
00:46:31,049 --> 00:46:34,564
Socks? l don't believe it.

503
00:46:37,529 --> 00:46:40,407
You didn't say
there was gonna be no spooks.

504
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:44,086
No, no, on weekdays he's meek,
mild Clark Kent.

505
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:48,521
He don't need no socks,
he's got hair all over his feet.

506
00:46:49,409 --> 00:46:50,762
Don't shoot me.

507
00:46:50,969 --> 00:46:55,440
All right, cut it out! That's my name.
Show me a little respect.

508
00:46:57,609 --> 00:46:59,201
All right, cool it.

509
00:47:00,369 --> 00:47:01,961
What do we need him f or?

510
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:09,041
He's crowd control. Unless anyone acts
up, he'll keep his thing in his pants.

511
00:47:09,489 --> 00:47:11,445
l'll be the judge of that.

512
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:15,682
l'm out.

513
00:47:17,649 --> 00:47:20,686
l don't know if he'll
do what you tell him.

514
00:47:23,929 --> 00:47:27,001
Socks, go get some beer and pizza.

515
00:47:36,409 --> 00:47:37,967
Go fetch.

516
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:41,122
Or go tell Angelo you don't
want the job.

517
00:47:48,689 --> 00:47:52,841
l don't like this neighbourhood.
l don't want to go out alone.

518
00:47:54,209 --> 00:48:00,284
Jimmy, take him to the pizza joint
and don't let no spooks mess with him.

519
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:13,446
l used mob money to back the caper.

520
00:48:13,649 --> 00:48:17,881
They gave us a schedule of all the
squad cars on the beat.

521
00:48:18,089 --> 00:48:22,640
They're gonna help us fence the
stuff. They'll get a split and....

522
00:48:24,409 --> 00:48:27,799
But they insisted that
we take this guy along.

523
00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:31,124
Because they want him knocked.

524
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:33,083
Killed.

525
00:48:34,569 --> 00:48:36,446
Oh, l'll do it.

526
00:48:37,689 --> 00:48:40,249
l figured you ought to know about it...

527
00:48:40,849 --> 00:48:45,127
...in case you wanted to get out.
lf you do, then do it now.

528
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:47,680
That was their price?

529
00:48:49,489 --> 00:48:51,286
lf you want, l'll do it.

530
00:48:56,969 --> 00:49:03,044
Violence, man. Maybe that's
what you're into. That's okay.

531
00:49:03,689 --> 00:49:06,078
l wouldn't do that myself.

532
00:49:11,689 --> 00:49:14,840
But if you think you should,
go right ahead.

533
00:49:28,609 --> 00:49:31,203
ln f or a penny, in f or a pound.

534
00:49:34,529 --> 00:49:38,238
-Inarid.
-Shut up.

535
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:41,719
You made it. Don't fiaht it anymore.

536
00:49:43,729 --> 00:49:45,685
What was it like?

537
00:49:47,409 --> 00:49:50,446
I don't know. I was scared.

538
00:49:50,649 --> 00:49:53,527
For God sakes, Werner, turn it off.

539
00:49:55,009 --> 00:49:57,569
Leave her alone. You can get any girl.

540
00:49:57,769 --> 00:50:01,079
-Werner, will you--?
-Shut up, you f our-bit hooker.

541
00:50:03,169 --> 00:50:04,568
l'm Werner.

542
00:50:06,449 --> 00:50:10,203
l pay f or her clothes,
this place, and f or her time.

543
00:50:10,409 --> 00:50:14,197
Maybe l got the price wrong,
but l know what to call her.

544
00:50:14,529 --> 00:50:19,045
As l don't pay f or it,
naturally l see things different.

545
00:50:21,049 --> 00:50:22,721
Will you turn that off?

546
00:50:22,929 --> 00:50:25,568
l never stop hearing it anyway.

547
00:50:30,929 --> 00:50:35,047
-Fighting over a woman. lt's crazy.
-Right.

548
00:50:35,249 --> 00:50:37,888
-So we won't fight.
-Okay.

549
00:50:38,209 --> 00:50:41,042
l know what you're doing.
l got it on tape.

550
00:50:41,249 --> 00:50:42,648
lt's true.

551
00:50:43,929 --> 00:50:46,489
So, what do l care about?

552
00:50:47,649 --> 00:50:54,122
Miss Blue Eyes. But l don't rent by
the day or week. l expect ex clusivity.

553
00:50:54,569 --> 00:50:56,002
What about her?

554
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:02,405
She's got the floor.
Say your piece, darling.

555
00:51:11,529 --> 00:51:16,478
Do you know why she's coming with me?
Because she knows a contract's value.

556
00:51:16,729 --> 00:51:19,721
She knows l'm cold, hard cash
on the line.

557
00:51:21,409 --> 00:51:27,882
Security. Something you can count on.
Not ex citing, but rich in tax-ex empts.

558
00:51:30,569 --> 00:51:35,484
lt sounds like he's blackmailing you.
What are you gonna do about that?

559
00:51:35,689 --> 00:51:39,523
l don't know.
The signs don't look so good no more.

560
00:51:40,769 --> 00:51:43,329
A whore, a convicted safecracker.

561
00:51:43,529 --> 00:51:47,522
Calling a man trying to protect
his property a blackmailer.

562
00:51:48,209 --> 00:51:49,642
lngrid...

563
00:51:51,009 --> 00:51:52,522
...l'll quit.

564
00:51:58,609 --> 00:52:00,839
l'll call the whole thing off.

565
00:52:01,049 --> 00:52:03,722
What do you say to that, lngrid?

566
00:52:07,009 --> 00:52:10,126
-l'm sorry.
-See? She's a whore.

567
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:17,486
l can't. l can't make it.

568
00:52:34,849 --> 00:52:38,239
-What?
-I don't wanna talk about it.

569
00:52:38,449 --> 00:52:40,883
-lt's okay. Take it easy.
-I hated it.

570
00:52:41,089 --> 00:52:46,322
lt's gonna be all right. We'll hit
Hawaii, two weeks in the sun.

571
00:52:46,529 --> 00:52:48,485
-Hey, Anderson.
-Yeah? What?

572
00:52:48,689 --> 00:52:53,001
Don't worry about the tapes.
You want to raid this place, do it.

573
00:52:53,209 --> 00:52:56,246
-Why?
-l don't know. Just f or the hell of it.

574
00:52:56,449 --> 00:53:00,647
-What about the other guy who listened?
-Nobody says nothing.

575
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:02,885
lf they did, they'd be in jail.

576
00:53:03,809 --> 00:53:10,282
--to pet me like a drooly little doa.
I don't know why I ever had to meet you.

577
00:53:10,489 --> 00:53:14,528
To aive me the chance to start
evenina thinas up.

578
00:53:42,769 --> 00:53:44,248
Come on, let's go.

579
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:10,285
-Okay.
-Go.

580
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:12,047
Look out.

581
00:55:52,089 --> 00:55:53,886
Come on, Pop.

582
00:55:56,609 --> 00:55:57,962
Where's Duke?

583
00:55:58,169 --> 00:56:00,000
-You drunk?
-No.

584
00:56:41,729 --> 00:56:43,208
O'Leary.

585
00:57:48,529 --> 00:57:50,440
Leave him room to breathe.

586
00:58:15,089 --> 00:58:19,287
Now you've got the TV here,
so you can see wherever we go.

587
00:58:19,489 --> 00:58:24,438
lf someone comes in, anything goes
wrong, you call us on the house phones.

588
00:58:24,609 --> 00:58:29,000
-Okay?
-Sure. Everything's gonna be okay.

589
00:58:30,809 --> 00:58:32,447
Hey, Duke.

590
00:58:32,849 --> 00:58:34,805
You looked swell on the TV.

591
00:58:51,489 --> 00:58:52,842
Yes, can l help you?

592
00:58:54,209 --> 00:59:00,239
l was transcribing tape recordings
of therapy sessions, when they came.

593
00:59:00,449 --> 00:59:04,840
l thought it was a disturbed patient,
and l was dealing with it...

594
00:59:05,049 --> 00:59:07,847
...when this shorter,
rounder one hit me.

595
00:59:08,049 --> 00:59:11,359
-He hit you at that time?
-Yes! l was surprised.

596
00:59:16,809 --> 00:59:20,438
-Parelli, f or chrissake.
-Just to keep him honest.

597
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:26,404
Okay, take some files.
Here, take the drug safe.

598
00:59:33,329 --> 00:59:37,117
No, no, no! l have a key.
l have a key.

599
00:59:38,649 --> 00:59:43,598
Did you move on your own? The tall one,
the leader. Did he make any threats?

600
00:59:43,809 --> 00:59:47,040
He didn't touch me.
He was upset by the violence.

601
00:59:47,249 --> 00:59:50,878
lf they moved you in fear,
it's kidnapping.

602
00:59:51,089 --> 00:59:54,604
But you've got to be af raid,
or it isn't kidnapping.

603
00:59:54,809 --> 00:59:57,403
Were you in fear of bodily harm?

604
01:00:49,889 --> 01:00:51,242
Yes?

605
01:00:51,449 --> 01:00:53,963
-What the hell is this?
-Mrs. Hathaway!

606
01:00:54,169 --> 01:00:55,727
Shut up.

607
01:00:56,289 --> 01:00:57,722
lt's a robbery!

608
01:00:57,929 --> 01:00:59,920
-No, burglary. Robbery--
-Shut up.

609
01:01:00,129 --> 01:01:02,802
-Don't talk to me like that.
-Shut up.

610
01:01:13,929 --> 01:01:19,128
We weren't expecting anyone.
lt was Labor Day weekend.

611
01:01:19,329 --> 01:01:23,527
But the doorbell rang
and l answered it.

612
01:01:23,729 --> 01:01:29,326
And this ape threw himself against the
door and burst into the room. l ran--

613
01:01:38,129 --> 01:01:39,562
What did you--?

614
01:01:42,249 --> 01:01:44,683
What are you--?
Get away f rom me.

615
01:01:44,889 --> 01:01:47,323
Cool off. All right? No more.

616
01:01:50,409 --> 01:01:52,001
Shut up! Sit down.

617
01:01:52,729 --> 01:01:54,640
He won't hit him no more.

618
01:01:56,889 --> 01:01:58,561
Socks.

619
01:01:58,809 --> 01:02:01,448
-They called him Socks?
-Yes.

620
01:02:28,769 --> 01:02:30,521
ls this the man?

621
01:02:30,729 --> 01:02:33,721
l don't know.
He had a mask over his f ace.

622
01:02:35,809 --> 01:02:37,162
Cool it!

623
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:44,962
Don't go in there,
you miserable creep!

624
01:02:47,249 --> 01:02:49,524
l told you to stay away.

625
01:02:51,449 --> 01:02:54,521
She hit me first.
She tried to give me a knee.

626
01:02:55,289 --> 01:02:58,042
How'd you like it if she did
that to you?

627
01:03:08,969 --> 01:03:11,437
This man likes to hurt people.

628
01:03:11,649 --> 01:03:13,526
Just do what we say...

629
01:03:13,729 --> 01:03:15,526
...and he won't hurt anybody.

630
01:03:15,729 --> 01:03:18,846
For God's sake,
you've got to control him!

631
01:03:20,809 --> 01:03:23,039
What have we got here?

632
01:03:30,569 --> 01:03:35,324
They have a big coin collection.
The rest is useless.

633
01:03:35,889 --> 01:03:39,245
l'll help you if you'll
just keep him away.

634
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:41,087
-Okay.
-Come on.

635
01:03:46,249 --> 01:03:48,763
Don't touch him. He's a paraplegic.

636
01:03:48,969 --> 01:03:53,008
He has asthma. He has to stay
in this air-conditioned room.

637
01:03:53,209 --> 01:03:54,608
Who are they, Mom?

638
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:58,998
We're after the coin collection.
ls it yours?

639
01:04:00,929 --> 01:04:02,885
What's the combination?

640
01:04:03,249 --> 01:04:04,568
Tell him, darling.

641
01:04:05,369 --> 01:04:08,918
lf they were any good,
they could do it the hard way.

642
01:04:10,369 --> 01:04:11,882
Tell him to tell us.

643
01:04:12,089 --> 01:04:14,967
-l won't.
-Mrs. Bingham.

644
01:04:15,169 --> 01:04:18,002
-He knew your name?
-Yes, it was planned.

645
01:04:18,209 --> 01:04:22,441
lt must have been. They put
us in the old lady's apartment.

646
01:04:26,209 --> 01:04:28,962
These knives must weigh
a pound apiece.

647
01:04:42,569 --> 01:04:44,002
Here you go.

648
01:04:52,049 --> 01:04:56,565
Bell Telephone bonds dated 1877.
God knows what they're worth.

649
01:04:56,769 --> 01:04:59,761
For God sakes, take them.
l'm tired of them.

650
01:04:59,969 --> 01:05:01,721
Your f ather gave you those.

651
01:05:01,929 --> 01:05:06,605
My f ather was one first-class
son of a bitch, as you well know.

652
01:05:08,729 --> 01:05:12,119
Go take a look in her room.
Look at what she reads.

653
01:05:12,329 --> 01:05:17,767
The Story of O. 73 years old and
all she's got to think about is sex.

654
01:05:37,649 --> 01:05:39,401
Terrific!

655
01:05:39,609 --> 01:05:43,648
lt was terrific! l didn't know you
could just snap them open.

656
01:05:43,849 --> 01:05:48,877
l could show you men that could just
tease and tickle a safe open.

657
01:05:49,089 --> 01:05:53,446
This is amateur stuff.
Leaving a mess like this. Look at it.

658
01:05:53,609 --> 01:05:57,761
lt's the kids, they don't know nothing,
and they don't wanna learn.

659
01:05:57,969 --> 01:05:59,846
What did you do then?

660
01:06:00,569 --> 01:06:03,481
-That's it.
-Okay, Hathaway.

661
01:06:05,369 --> 01:06:06,802
What can l do?

662
01:06:07,009 --> 01:06:10,843
l can't move.
The windows are sealed shut.

663
01:06:11,369 --> 01:06:13,678
-The phones are dead.
-Okay.

664
01:07:38,609 --> 01:07:41,248
Oh, my God, double eagles!

665
01:07:41,449 --> 01:07:43,758
-What's a double eagle?
-Oh, really.

666
01:07:47,409 --> 01:07:52,847
This is WA2UYL in New York.
We are being robbed.

667
01:07:53,049 --> 01:07:58,362
The address is 1 East 91st Street.
Please call police.

668
01:07:58,569 --> 01:08:00,605
This is WA2--

669
01:08:00,809 --> 01:08:05,803
lt's our first company since V-E Day,
when everyone opened their doors.

670
01:08:06,009 --> 01:08:09,718
Then World War ll ended,
and no more visiting around.

671
01:08:09,929 --> 01:08:11,885
l told Kaler to make tea.

672
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:14,678
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

673
01:08:14,889 --> 01:08:17,687
Would it be all right
if l made some tea?

674
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:20,442
Mrs. Kaler, can l help?

675
01:08:20,649 --> 01:08:24,039
Please, thank you.
Those homely words mean so much.

676
01:08:24,249 --> 01:08:27,082
She talks like a letter to Dear Abby.

677
01:08:30,369 --> 01:08:31,882
Police department.

678

-For God's sake, operator, I'll pay!

-Who's at the elevator?

01:10:37,809 --> 01:10:42,087
He didn't say. Get that stuff inside!
Kid, you come with us!

01:10:42,249 --> 01:10:43,238
Oh, my god.

My God, that man's bleeding.

722
01:11:21,849 --> 01:11:23,680
A squad car just went by.

723
01:11:23,849 --> 01:11:26,602
-Did he stop?
-No, he just passed by.

Release the elevator, please.

Hey, Duke, it's getting late.

Okay, let's get the Longene loot

Kid, call Pop.
Tell him to ring the Longenes.

734

Okay.

739
01:12:58,409 --> 01:12:59,398
Hit it, Kid.

740
01:13:49,849 --> 01:13:51,646

Return it to him, and find out why
he had it in his car.

743
01:14:04,489 --> 01:14:06,127
Personal...

Yeah, well, what is it
you want me to do, sir?

749
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:40,483
You know the 18-story building
adjacent to the subject structure?

750
01:14:42,329 --> 01:14:43,762
Yes, sir.

751
01:14:43,929 --> 01:14:47,365
That's the high ground.

752
01:14:48,729 --> 01:14:50,208
Yes, sir.

753
01:14:50,369 --> 01:14:53,202
Now your squad will take
the high ground.

754
01:14:53,369 --> 01:14:57,078
Jump onto the roof
of the subject structure...

755
01:14:57,289 --> 01:14:59,678
...go down ropes on the outside...

756
01:14:59,849 --> 01:15:05,082
...drive the suspects
out of the building, into the street...

757
01:15:05,249 --> 01:15:07,604
...and we'll be waiting f or them.

758
01:15:09,449 --> 01:15:10,438
Yes, sir.

759
01:15:56,169 --> 01:15:58,046
Who are you?

760
01:15:58,329 --> 01:16:00,047
Then what did he do?

761
01:16:00,209 --> 01:16:03,724
We tried to wake up my wife.
She's a sound sleeper.

762
01:16:03,889 --> 01:16:07,564
They couldn't break into my safe.
lt's a marvellous safe.

763
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:10,323
They said to tell them the combination.

764
01:16:10,489 --> 01:16:11,638
You tell them?

765
01:16:11,809 --> 01:16:13,128
Hey, Tommy.

766
01:17:12,209 --> 01:17:16,122
Everson, your job is to protect
private property...

767
01:17:16,289 --> 01:17:19,804
...and preserve the safety
of the inhabitants.

768
01:17:25,529 --> 01:17:27,326
l can't do it.

769
01:17:27,569 --> 01:17:28,558
Son of a bitch!

770
01:17:28,729 --> 01:17:32,005
Give me the numbers
or l'll bust your ass.

771
01:17:39,569 --> 01:17:41,480
For God's sake!

772
01:17:42,529 --> 01:17:46,044
How does that grab you?
Now give me those numbers!

773
01:17:52,969 --> 01:17:56,598
Those things are museum pieces.
They're irreplaceable.

774
01:17:58,649 --> 01:18:01,083
Now, you give me these numbers.

775
01:18:46,969 --> 01:18:48,960
Help him up!
Help him up!

776
01:18:49,129 --> 01:18:53,884
Push harder.
Put your hand under his f oot.

777
01:19:11,009 --> 01:19:14,763
All right, feed me out, feed me out.

778
01:19:14,929 --> 01:19:17,363
Okay, tie me off right there.

779
01:19:27,969 --> 01:19:30,119
You're wasting our own loot.

780
01:19:38,489 --> 01:19:40,161
He won't really hurt you.

781
01:19:40,329 --> 01:19:42,923
Darling, it's all right.
Just hold on.

782
01:19:43,209 --> 01:19:46,679
lt just hurts right now,
but you'll be all right.

783
01:19:46,849 --> 01:19:49,921
You bastard! Tell him!

784
01:19:50,129 --> 01:19:53,007
Be brave, be brave, darling.

785
01:19:54,889 --> 01:19:57,528
lsn't it risky to stay on?

786
01:20:05,089 --> 01:20:06,078
Get Socks.

787
01:20:13,489 --> 01:20:15,320
Get the other hookup.

788
01:20:20,809 --> 01:20:23,687
-Come on!
-Turn loose! Turn loose!

789
01:20:23,969 --> 01:20:26,199
Good slide, man. Good slide.

790
01:20:31,129 --> 01:20:32,608
Okay, let's go.

791
01:20:42,809 --> 01:20:43,798
Him!

792
01:20:45,249 --> 01:20:47,763
Good. Kill him!
Make him hurt.

793
01:20:47,929 --> 01:20:48,918
Kill him!

794
01:20:49,969 --> 01:20:52,563
Oh, him. l knew he'd kill me.

795
01:20:53,049 --> 01:20:54,562
Let it go!

796
01:21:22,089 --> 01:21:23,078
Shit.

797
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:27,398
Come on!
Let's go, let's go!

798
01:21:29,809 --> 01:21:31,208
Take it away.

799
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:42,523
All right, now go toward the wall.
Drop the blue line.

800
01:21:43,169 --> 01:21:44,158
Go on up there.

801
01:21:46,169 --> 01:21:49,286
Go hand-over-hand on the rope.
That's it.

802
01:22:02,529 --> 01:22:04,838
We-- We've done it.

803
01:23:00,769 --> 01:23:04,045
Pop, no questions.
Go lock the stairwell door.

804
01:23:20,809 --> 01:23:23,198
Take care of the second floor.

805
01:23:38,849 --> 01:23:40,965
Blue Six, this is Jade Six.

806
01:23:41,609 --> 01:23:43,600
Blue Six, this is Jade Six.

807
01:23:44,009 --> 01:23:47,081
Fuck! Testing, one, two.

808
01:23:48,529 --> 01:23:50,884
Blue Six, this is Jade Six.

809
01:23:52,209 --> 01:23:54,200
Blue Six, this is Jade Six.

810
01:24:24,489 --> 01:24:27,606
Can you see anything
on the 91st Street monitor?

811
01:24:28,649 --> 01:24:31,163
-Nothing.
-What about the basement?

812
01:24:32,249 --> 01:24:33,238
Nothing.

813
01:24:39,249 --> 01:24:41,444
Can't see anybody outside.

814
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:45,124
-But l know they're there.
-Crash through with the truck.

815
01:24:49,529 --> 01:24:50,723
Okay, let's go.

816
01:25:04,209 --> 01:25:06,245
What's the matter?

817
01:25:06,449 --> 01:25:08,326
l can't make it.

818
01:25:10,889 --> 01:25:16,486
When the cops come, put your
hands up and they won't harm you.

819
01:25:16,649 --> 01:25:18,765
-Okay?
-Okay.

820
01:25:18,929 --> 01:25:19,918
l'm sorry.

821
01:25:24,889 --> 01:25:28,325
We got hostages.
We'll use them as shields.

822
01:25:32,369 --> 01:25:33,802
Get the kid.

823
01:25:43,209 --> 01:25:44,437
Get to those people!

824
01:25:44,609 --> 01:25:46,167
Blue Six, this is Jade Six!

825
01:25:46,329 --> 01:25:47,318
Everson!

826
01:25:47,489 --> 01:25:51,118
The goddamn thing doesn't work!
Wait f or me!

827
01:25:51,289 --> 01:25:53,598
Leave him, he's dead!

828
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:14,161
Look out!
The truck's moving.

829
01:26:47,129 --> 01:26:48,244
Let it go!

830
01:27:20,049 --> 01:27:21,038
Pull over here!

831
01:27:25,489 --> 01:27:27,878
Get that man to a hospital.

832
01:27:28,049 --> 01:27:29,038
Be caref ul!

833
01:27:29,209 --> 01:27:30,198
Out of the way!

834
01:27:35,889 --> 01:27:37,083
Sergeant!

835
01:27:39,329 --> 01:27:40,318
Report!

836
01:27:40,489 --> 01:27:44,528
This is everyone, sir.
There's a crippled kid upstairs.

837
01:27:44,809 --> 01:27:47,528
-Who else?
-A stiff on three, named Parelli.

838
01:27:47,689 --> 01:27:48,838
Why didn't you say so?

839
01:27:49,009 --> 01:27:51,079
-Captain!
-What?

840
01:27:51,249 --> 01:27:55,367
Me. l was part of it.
Please, captain, l'm ready to go back.

841
01:27:55,529 --> 01:27:57,440
-Who else?
-You got us.

842
01:27:57,609 --> 01:28:00,919
Me, the guy up on three,
he was the brains of it.

843
01:28:01,089 --> 01:28:03,478
-He laid it out.
-Book him!

844
01:28:03,649 --> 01:28:05,844
Thank you, captain.

845
01:28:13,849 --> 01:28:14,838
Book him!

846
01:28:18,849 --> 01:28:22,080
You take ten men
and go up on the roof.

847
01:28:22,249 --> 01:28:27,448
You first seven men come with me. We'll
take the second and f ourth floors.

848
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:33,047
You take the rest of the men and
take the first and the third floor.

849
01:28:46,649 --> 01:28:50,608
What the hell is this?
All right, Tony, go in there.

850
01:29:06,009 --> 01:29:08,569
They didn't even touch this place.

851
01:29:08,729 --> 01:29:10,048
That's f unny.

852
01:29:11,249 --> 01:29:13,683
All right, let's clear out.

853
01:30:22,729 --> 01:30:26,358
Take it easy.
Just breathe deep.

854
01:30:26,529 --> 01:30:30,124
-Stand up slow, that's it.
-Here, under my hand.

855
01:30:46,409 --> 01:30:48,081
Captain Delaney.

856
01:30:50,329 --> 01:30:52,638
Who the hell put that thing there?

857
01:30:52,809 --> 01:30:55,482
There'd better be a warrant f or this.

858
01:31:05,209 --> 01:31:07,882
That's in the Everleigh flat, 2B.

859
01:31:10,409 --> 01:31:11,922
Come on!

860
01:31:19,249 --> 01:31:21,683
Come with me.
The rest upstairs.

861
01:31:21,849 --> 01:31:24,966
There's a guy in the basement.
Take care of him.

862
01:31:30,369 --> 01:31:31,802
Here, doc.

863
01:31:32,929 --> 01:31:35,727
-Stand back!
-Keep those reporters out.

864
01:31:36,729 --> 01:31:38,526
-ls he conscious?
-l don't know.

865
01:31:38,689 --> 01:31:40,884
Let me get that microphone.

866
01:31:41,049 --> 01:31:44,758
-Can you hear me?
-All right, clear the area.

867
01:31:45,049 --> 01:31:46,960
You wanna make a statement?

868
01:31:47,129 --> 01:31:49,404
Shut up, he's making a statement.

869
01:31:49,929 --> 01:31:53,683
My God. She says...

870
01:31:53,849 --> 01:31:58,161
-...l always hammer on locked doors.
-What's that supposed to mean?

871
01:31:58,329 --> 01:32:00,126
Get him out.

872
01:32:05,649 --> 01:32:08,686
l want a report on that tape.
An operation this size...

873
01:32:08,889 --> 01:32:10,686
...you'd think somebody'd talk.

874
01:32:10,849 --> 01:32:13,488
He won't fit, stand him up.

875
01:32:16,129 --> 01:32:20,645
We gotta get him up.
One more. One, two, and....

876
01:33:03,009 --> 01:33:05,159
Did you see the papers?

877
01:33:05,329 --> 01:33:11,438
Didn't we have a Duke Anderson
on the Angelo tapes? Well, erase them.

878
01:33:13,409 --> 01:33:15,047
We're the government.

879
01:33:15,209 --> 01:33:19,760
We can't risk anybody finding those
tapes. They're illegal. Erase them.

880
01:33:21,089 --> 01:33:25,799
The police will trace Anderson
and we get caught with illegal tapes.

881
01:33:25,969 --> 01:33:27,687
Erase them.
