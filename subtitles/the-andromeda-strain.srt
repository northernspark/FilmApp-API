<i>Piedmont, New Mexico.</i> <i>Population 68.</i>

3
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,060
Come on.

4
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,940
I didn't notice them before.

5
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,560
That's crazy. I didn't know buzzards fly at night.

6
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,830
<i>That's what they look like.</i>

7
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,420
Here.

8
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,210
<i>Boy, that's some dead burg.</i>

9
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,020
Buzzards only come when something's dead.

10
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,130
Well, I guess we better go in and have a look.

11
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,950
<i>This is Caper One</i> <i>to Vandal Deca.</i>

12
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,860
<i>Caper One to Vandal Deca.</i> <i>Are you reading? Over.</i>

13
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,060
Yes, I'm reading. Over.

14
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,450
<i>We're about to enter</i> <i>the town of Piedmont</i> <i>and recover the satellite.</i>

15
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,460
Very good, Caper One. Leave your radio open.

16
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,620
Roger.

17
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,900
<i>We're now inside the town.</i>

18
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,370
<i>It's kinda spooky.</i>

19
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,060
<i>I see a church steeple</i> <i>ahead on the left.</i>

20
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,810
<i>It's quiet here.</i>

21
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,230
<i>It's the damndest thing.</i> <i>There's no sign of life.</i>

22
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,890
<i>The signals from the satellite</i> <i>are getting very strong.</i>

23
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,660
<i>Sir!</i> <i>You see that, Lieutenant?</i>

24
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,890
<i>See what, Crane?</i> <i>Over by the fence.</i> <i>It looks like a body.</i>

25
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,230
<i>Easy, Crane.</i> <i>You're imagining things.</i>

26
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,480
<i>Holy!</i> <i>Sir, it's another one.</i>

27
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,030
<i>You're right.</i> <i>It looks dead.</i>

28
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,340
<i>Yes, sir, shall I...</i> <i>No! Stay in the van.</i>

29
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,630
Vandal Deca to Caper One. What's happening?

30
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,050
<i>- We see bodies, lots of them.</i> - Are you certain, Caper One?

31
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,500
<i>Damn it, Comroe,</i> <i>of course we're certain.</i>

32
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,800
Your orders are... proceed to satellite and retrieve.

33
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,870
<i>Roger, Vandal Deca.</i>

34
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,090
Stay at your stations! Hit that security button!

35
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,930
<i>Get me Major Manchek.</i>

36
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,010
<i>Somehow they don't hardly</i> <i>look dead, Lieutenant.</i>

37
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,270
They're all over the place. Must be dozens of them. Damn it, get this call through!

38
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,790
It's sort of like they just dropped in their tracks, sir.

39
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,140
<i>Sir!</i> <i>Good Chri..!</i>

40
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,000
<i>Do you see that thing</i> <i>in white?</i> <i>Yeah, it's coming toward us.</i>

41
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,810
Major, this may sound crazy, but there's something strange going on with Caper One.

42
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,350
Sir, I think we should get out of h...

43
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,210
Hello, Ops, this is Major Manchek, Scoop Control A-12.

44
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,060
We need a flyby over Piedmont, New Mexico.

45
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,160
Infrared. A FLIR scan, all sectors. Film to come direct to Scoop.

46
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,860
Assign Gunner Wilson, if he's not crocked someplace.

47
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,350
Jeez!

48
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,950
I'm declaring a state of emergency.

49
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,540
All personnel restricted to base.

50
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,670
Everything seen and heard in that room is top secret. Yes, sir.

51
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,080
This is a recording. State your name and your message and hang up.

52
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:12,020
Major Arthur Manchek, Scoop Mission Control A-12.

53
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,100
I recommend calling a Wildfire Alert.

54
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,740
We have evidence here on film of unnatural death caused by Scoop 7 returning to earth.

55
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,550
Time check 0-1-4-7 inclusive.

56
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,460
We'd like to see Dr. Jeremy Stone, please.

57
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:18,270
Well, I'm Mrs. Stone. We are having a party. May I...

58
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,990
<i>Does that man</i> <i>have a gun?</i>

59
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,010
Ma'am, we must see Dr. Stone.

60
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,460
What is this?

61
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,550
Please call Dr. Stone to the door. Otherwise we'll go get him.

62
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,950
Just a minute.

63
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,490
I'll just wait here, ma'am.

64
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,500
I'll come to Berkeley anytime, Stone.

65
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,430
That $4 million must be your largest federal grant.

66
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,760
May I see you, Jeremy?

67
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,210
The S.D.S. has arrived no doubt.

68
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,510
Jeremy, there are some Army types in the hall and two more outside with guns.

69
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,350
They want to see you. I'll take care of it.

70
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,840
Jeremy! If you knew about this, you might've told...

71
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,400
I didn't. I'll explain later.

72
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,950
I'm Dr. Stone.

73
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,870
Yes. I'm Captain Morton.

74
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,430
There's a fire, sir.

75
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,900
I've got to leave.

76
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,520
For God's sakes, Jeremy! When will you be back?

77
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,300
I'm not sure. The guns, is it...

78
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,310
<i>Mrs. Stone, it's our job</i> <i>to protect your husband.</i>

79
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,870
From now on, nothing must be allowed to happen to him.

80
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,490
I'll be safe as in your arms.

81
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,980
Jeremy? Jeremy!

82
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,400
You tell the senator it's his daughter!

83
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,180
Allison?

84
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,950
Dad, something very peculiar has just happened, even for Jeremy.

85
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,440
A few minutes ago...

86
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,820
Dad, are you there? What's going on?

87
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,180
This communication is being monitored.

88
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,800
The connection has been broken for reasons of national security.

89
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,230
You will be briefed at the appropriate time.

90
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,400
Thank you for your cooperation, Mrs. Stone.

91
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,180
I feel like Onassis.

92
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,170
It was the fastest thing we could arrange, sir.

93
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,660
Thanks.

94
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,360
Yes?

95
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,670
General Sparks here. I just wanted to inform you...

96
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,990
that all members of your team have been cleared and are now being called in.

97
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,930
Except for Professor Kirke. He's in the hospital. Appendectomy.

98
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,750
You'll get complete details on everything when your team is assembled.

99
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,370
You don't make sense. You talk like you've been brainwashed.

100
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,230
You don't understand.

101
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,810
Germ warfare people, Dad? A lab accident? Thank you.

102
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,780
It's different this time. Don't pack, Claire, I won't need anything.

103
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,110
A hippie. He's going to a love-in.

104
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,090
I give up.

105
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,640
One minute you're fed up. You talk about retiring... to Alaska yet!

106
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,650
Now you've turned into a cloak-and-dagger man.

107
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,580
My glasses. Here they are, Dad.

108
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,710
Can't you at least tell me who phoned at this ungodly hour?

109
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,910
Grandpa, there's a car, and they got guns.

110
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,350
<i>Do they now?</i> <i>Well, that's serious.</i>

111
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,850
I'll watch out. Honey, you've been dreaming.

112
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,420
I wish I were!

113
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,650
No. Uh-uh. Get someone else.

114
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,850
Dr. Leavitt, I told you, there's a fire!

115
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,780
My experiment's at the critical stage.

116
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,490
I've been working around the clock. I can't just leave now.

117
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,580
I want that new plate read as soon as it's developed.

118
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,760
Yes, ma'am.

119
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,300
My orders come from Dr. Robertson,

120
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,410
the president's science advisor in Washington.

121
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,900
There's a phone. Pick it up. Call Robbie.

122
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,760
Tell him I burnt my draft card.

123
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,180
Are you sick, ma'am? We have a physician on call.

124
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,100
All Dr. Leavitt needs is rest.

125
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,470
Knock it off, Bess.

126
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,960
If the physician certifies that you are unable to continue...

127
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,940
No!

128
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,010
I'm fine.

129
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,380
Relax.

130
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,810
I'm going with you.

131
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,180
Skin knife.

132
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,930
<i>Hold it, Mark.</i> <i>Sorry to disturb you.</i>

133
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,090
There's just been a call from a Dr. Robertson at the White House.

134
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,550
<i>Your orders</i> <i>are to break scrub.</i>

135
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,110
Orders? I've got a patient all ready.

136
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,250
Kelly will take over for you.

137
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,620
It's all arranged. You're expected in the surgeon's room in 30 seconds.

138
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,010
Are you sure the satellite isn't radioactive?

139
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,860
No. Manchek showed me the telemetry reports.

140
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,310
Presumably, it could be some form of space germ.

141
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:07,380
Presumably this stuff is nonporous.

142
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,460
Why did you pick me?

143
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:14,170
You're an M.D., a talented surgeon who knows blood chemistries...

144
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,460
and you're single... the "Odd Man Hypothesis."

145
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,420
What the hell is that?

146
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,650
Didn't you read the Wildfire material I've been sending you?

147
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,750
Very little. I never went in much for science fiction.

148
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,540
Nor do I!

149
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,900
<i>It seems to me, General,</i> <i>Dr. Stone put one over on you.</i>

150
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:47,190
In fact, he made us all think his Wildfire Lab could handle contamination from outer space.

151
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,190
I disagree with the senator from Vermont.

152
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,150
Dr. Stone, a Nobel Prize winner,

153
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,630
<i>twice president of the</i> <i>National Academy of Sciences,</i> <i>is well known here in Washington.</i>

154
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,760
Is the implication that Dr. Stone deliberately misled us?

155
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,060
Perhaps not deliberately, Senator.

156
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:07,220
I'm reasonably certain that before the night the Wildfire Team was mobilized,

157
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,200
Dr. Stone didn't know Scoop existed.

158
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,210
- I'm astounded. - Reasons of national security.

159
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,110
Very smart. We've had experiences with scientists before.

160
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,060
Now, let's talk about this famous letter...

161
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,200
Dr. Stone sent to the president some two years ago.

162
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,070
<i>From what you're saying,</i> <i>it was just a shot in the dark?</i>

163
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,570
Perhaps that's a little unfair, Senator.

164
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,570
Dr. Stone and I were consultants with NASA on the Lunar Receiving Lab.

165
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,250
He wasn't completely satisfied. He felt a more advanced lab was required.

166
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,040
You mean more expensive, don't you?

167
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:42,480
I call that Dr. Stone's $90 million mash note to Uncle Sam.

168
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:46,680
<i>"In a true biological</i> <i>crisis which our exploration</i> <i>of space could bring about,</i>

169
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,680
"the present Lunar Receiving Laboratory might prove inadequate.

170
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,230
"I therefore urge the establishment of a facility...

171
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,200
"to deal specifically with an extraterrestrial form of life.

172
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,250
"The purpose of this facility would be to limit...

173
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,620
"the dissemination of such an unknown organism from outer space...

174
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,980
"and to provide laboratories for its analysis.

175
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,380
"I recommend that this facility be located...

176
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,130
"in an uninhabited region of the United States,

177
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,470
"that it utilize all known isolation techniques,

178
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,770
"and that it be equipped with a nuclear device for self-destruction...

179
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,690
"in the event of an emergency.

180
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,890
Yours very truly, Jeremy Stone."

181
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,900
Don't encourage the president to think scientists are wizards.

182
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,280
If things get out of control, and they might, even you can't work miracles.

183
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,870
I'd expect to have your help, Charlie.

184
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,490
Piedmont approaching, gentlemen.

185
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,630
Go over and give us a look first, Dempsey.

186
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,070
<i>I was afraid of that.</i>

187
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:17,460
<i>The birds'll eat</i> <i>the infected flesh, and then</i> <i>fly off and spread the disease.</i>

188
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,290
If it is a disease.

189
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,500
Drop the gas canisters. Someone's supposed to be alive down there!

190
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:36,790
<i>Somebody did something.</i> <i>That's for sure.</i>

191
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,930
Let's give it a double dose.

192
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:52,180
<i>That gas will only kill the birds.</i>

193
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,320
Okay, Dempsey, hover over the main street and drop the ladder.

194
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,590
Do not attempt to land. Is that clear?

195
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,410
Roger. Clearer all the time.

196
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,570
When we climb down, lift off to 1,000 feet and hover at a safe distance.

197
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:07,830
And come back when we signal. If anything happens to us, you have your orders.

198
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:12,270
Yes, sir. Proceed directly to Wildfire and then...

199
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:16,660
If we're eliminated, the aircraft and pilot will have to be sterilized.

200
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,580
Wait a minute!

201
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:22,100
That's not what they told me. Just incinerated.

202
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,120
Coronary? I doubt it.

203
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,390
<i>Hall!</i>

204
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,100
Take a look at this. Are you sure that isn't coronary?

205
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:02,160
<i>No, coronary's painful.</i> <i>They should grimace.</i>

206
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,340
If it was fast, they wouldn't have time.

207
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:07,440
Fast? These people were cut down in mid-stride.

208
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,100
Up there! Look.

209
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,690
An Air Force jet.

210
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,850
If we don't make it to Wildfire, he'll see the helicopter does... or shoot it down.

211
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,430
Well, for Dempsey's sake, we better not slip up.

212
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,670
"The Day of Judgment is at hand.

213
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,800
Have mercy on my soul and to hell with all the others. Amen."

214
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:48,310
Senile. This took time! Regardless of what made her do it, it took time.

215
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,480
There's a chance someone's still alive.

216
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,800
I wouldn't believe you could commit suicide that way.

217
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,090
Most of them died instantly, but a few had time to go quietly nuts.

218
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,850
Let's find the damn satellite.

219
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,840
This injury, there isn't any bleeding.

220
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:29,940
A cut like this... torn veins, broken capillaries... should bleed like hell.

221
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,230
Yes. Well, there's no blood on any of them.

222
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,220
Even where it's chewed, no bleeding.

223
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,800
Hold it, hold it!

224
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,480
You'd better back up. We gotta go to the... left.

225
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,970
<i>We're damn close.</i> <i>Bear right.</i>

226
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,300
I'll bet they took it to the doctor.

227
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,570
There it is.

228
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,540
<i>The damn fool opened it!</i>

229
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:23,890
Yeah, every country doctor should run his office like the lunar lab.

230
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,380
The capsule first, Hall.

231
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:30,350
<i>We've got about 40 minutes</i> <i>of oxygen left.</i>

232
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,700
Have a look at his buttocks.

233
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,620
That's not funny. Not meant to be.

234
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,710
Normally blood in a dead person goes to the lowest points.

235
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:57,460
There should be marks of lividity. Do you see purplish marks on his butt?

236
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,380
No.

237
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,870
Careful you don't puncture your suit.

238
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,390
Clotted blood!

239
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,250
Powdered!

240
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,320
I'll be damned!

241
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:22,190
No wonder they didn't bleed. It's clotted throughout the entire system.

242
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:25,750
Five quarts of blood turned to powder!

243
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,630
In theory, I suppose, a single organism could do it.

244
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,450
But, in fact, there isn't an organism on Earth...

245
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,850
You mean there didn't used to be.

246
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:24,950
I don't... We heard it all right.

247
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,900
Go away! Go back!

248
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,500
Get back! Get outta here. Go back!

249
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:39,290
<i>Get away!</i>

250
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,220
This must be the mother.

251
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,490
He's scared, and hungry as hell.

252
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,240
Can't be more than six months. There's probably a formula in the kitchen.

253
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,540
Don't feed it! He hasn't eaten in at least 12 hours!

254
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:26,390
We don't do anything until we get that kid into a controlled situation.

255
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,290
Maybe feeding is part of the disease process. Maybe those who hadn't eaten lasted longest.

256
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,230
Whatever it is, with our oxygen running out, we can't take a chance.

257
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:37,580
Wait a minute. This is a major break... a survivor.

258
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,800
Too bad he can't tell us what happened.

259
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:43,350
Maybe he can... if he lives.

260
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,260
<i>You!</i>

261
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,060
You... you did it!

262
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:34,060
Give me that knife.

263
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:39,030
You're not human. Everybody's dead.

264
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,430
What happened?

265
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,830
What is it?

266
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,260
What happened?

267
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:05,650
<i>The town is finished,</i> <i>contaminated beyond all...</i>

268
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,930
Careful, sir. This is an open transmission.

269
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:11,820
I'm aware of that, Manchek. Order up a 7-12. Only the president...

270
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:16,880
Precisely. Get on it. The town must be neutralized immediately.

271
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:29,530
Has the president made his decision on Directive 7-12 yet?

272
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,980
He doesn't jump into things, Dr. Robertson.

273
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,480
First I've got to put together a briefing for him.

274
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:37,900
The president's main concern is the international consequences.

275
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,860
What do you think, Mr. Secretary?

276
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,420
It's against the Moscow Treaty of 1963...

277
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,240
to fire thermonuclear weapons above ground.

278
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:50,610
The Russians will have to be privately informed we're going to cauterize the area.

279
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,260
Then they'll ask a flock of questions. Some we don't want answered.

280
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,920
That'll take hours.

281
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,850
God knows how far the infection can spread in that time.

282
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,660
Yes, Chief?

283
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,030
Yes, sir.

284
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,960
Yes, Mr. President.

285
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:20,430
The president's decided to postpone Directive 7-12 for 24 to 48 hours.

286
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:24,760
Instead he'll call out the National Guard to cordon off the area around Piedmont.

287
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,160
<i>That's your department, Ed.</i> Safe and sound.

288
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,470
It should've been left up to the scientists.

289
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,450
It's a colossal mistake.

290
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:36,180
Tell the president I said so.

291
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:40,470
No, but... I'll get you an appointment.

292
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,920
<i>By whose decision, General, was</i> <i>the site for Wildfire chosen?</i>

293
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:47,860
<i>Dr. Stone's.</i> <i>It seemed ideal</i> <i>because of its remoteness.</i>

294
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:52,090
<i>There was no inhabited area</i> <i>near Wildfire</i> <i>for a radius of 112 miles.</i>

295
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:56,940
<i>Las Vegas is to the north,</i> <i>Phoenix to the south,</i> <i>Los Angeles west.</i>

296
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,380
<i>Weren't you worried</i> <i>the infection might spread to them?</i>

297
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:03,570
<i>Yes, sir, I was, but</i> <i>Dr. Stone and Dr. Robertson</i> <i>assured the president...</i>

298
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,420
<i>Wildfire was foolproof</i> <i>because of its device</i> <i>for atomic self-destruct.</i>

299
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,900
<i>The military</i> <i>had to take a backseat.</i>

300
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,120
At least they could've sent a licensed driver to meet me at that crummy airstrip.

301
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:30,490
They keep personnel to a minimum for obvious reasons.

302
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:36,120
You're lost! No one's been down this goat path for years.

303
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:40,050
That's how it's supposed to look. They spent $50,000 on it.

304
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,700
Putting in the potholes? Getting rid of the tread marks.

305
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,620
Those big tractors leave a lasting impression.

306
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,720
A lot of heavy equipment has passed this way.

307
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:00,950
Where's our leader? We'll catch up to him and Hall very soon now.

308
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:05,810
Why'd they pick Hall? He's no scientist. Who needs an overpriced M.D.?

309
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,770
Relax and enjoy your cigarette. It's your last.

310
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,480
<i>It starts here.</i>

311
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,860
It's a great place to grow pot.

312
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:39,090
Just a plain old crop of barley. Still, it is rather clever, I think.

313
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,990
Something wrong? I never liked red lights.

314
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,630
Reminds me of my years in a bordello.

315
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,100
Howdy.

316
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,110
Howdy-do-dee.

317
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:28,150
You got the time? My watch stopped at 11:46.

318
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,970
Darn shame. Must be the heat.

319
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,450
It's no fake, believe me.

320
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,300
When I retire, I'd like an agricultural station like this in Alaska.

321
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,830
You, a sourdough? Hmph! The sourest. This way.

322
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,210
Step in.

323
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,910
<i>Cute.</i>

324
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,880
The whole thing, what a world we're making.

325
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,740
I can see why the kids are dropping out. We should've.

326
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,670
It's an emergency, Dutton. We got tagged. Period.

327
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,590
Until I saw those photos from Vandenberg, I...

328
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,850
They brought it on themselves. Who? The people in Piedmont?

329
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,060
What you said before,

330
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,230
you don't believe the infection in that capsule was brought back deliberately, do you?

331
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,490
Skip it. I hope I'm talking through my hat.

332
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,650
Put your hands on that glass, palms down. It's a finger and palm print analyzer. It...

333
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,270
Reads a composite of 10,000 dermatographic lines.

334
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,740
How'd you know that? Oh, Dutton, I have a long criminal record.

335
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:25,650
Then you're in trouble. This machine has a long memory.

336
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,360
It gives you final clearance to enter Wildfire.

337
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,410
<i>Isothermal reading</i> <i>for M.C. levels 4 and 5...</i>

338
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,260
<i>is Z.B. and R.A. over 2.9.</i>

339
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:48,050
How's Piedmont? I had to order up a 7-12. How are you, Ruth?

340
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,450
No other way to halt the infection spread. Oh.

341
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,820
Oh, you two know each other, don't you?

342
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:57,780
By reputation only. Ah, yes, up to now we've had to worship from afar.

343
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:00,300
<i>Be good, Ruth.</i>

344
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:09,430
Any messages for me from the White House?

345
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,890
Not a thing, Dr. Stone, or you'd have it.

346
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,000
No personal messages? No, ma'am.

347
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,980
Nothing from Dr. Robertson? Are you sure, Sergeant?

348
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,600
Dr. Stone, sir, I have one thing to do. Just one.

349
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:24,430
Everything else is fully automatic, computerized and self-regulating.

350
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,570
I... I listen for a little bell in here.

351
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,870
Ding-a-ling. That means a message coming in is for the Wildfire Team.

352
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,490
Precisely! An M.C.N. communication. I'm expecting one.

353
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,700
Yes, sir! Top priority.

354
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,810
Ding-a-ling. I push a button...

355
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,110
and all five level control centers are notified the same time you are.

356
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,030
The bell hasn't rung, sir.

357
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,430
Thanks for the tour, Sergeant.

358
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,320
Dr. Dutton. Thank you.

359
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,420
Will you follow me, Dr. Leavitt? And may I have your glasses, please?

360
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,340
What for? They'll be treated and returned to you, Doctor.

361
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,920
They better be, or I'll need a white cane.

362
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:04,090
Who picked Leavitt?

363
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:09,140
Talk about the Odd Man Hypothesis, which we haven't yet. She's really an oddball.

364
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,060
We're lucky to have her.

365
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,620
She's the best equipped of us to double up for Kirke in microbiology.

366
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:17,940
<i>When dressed,</i> <i>the team will proceed directly</i> <i>to conference room 7.</i>

367
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,320
Keep this with you at all times.

368
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,750
What's it for?

369
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,440
You're the Odd Man. The key man, quite literally.

370
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,720
This other key, and Wildfire itself, depend on your key.

371
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:04,020
Wildfire's equipped with a nuclear device for self-destruct.

372
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:07,280
In an emergency, it's activated automatically.

373
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:10,580
I've just inserted the key in the main station that arms the mechanism.

374
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,690
The device is ready for detonation.

375
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,380
When? <i>Never, we hope.</i>

376
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:18,990
It only goes off if there's danger of infection breaking out from here.

377
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,880
That silver key can't be removed.

378
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,940
You're the only one who can disarm the mechanism by inserting your red key...

379
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,590
in one of the substations located throughout the facility.

380
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:33,490
There's a five-minute delay between the time detonation locks in and the bomb explodes.

381
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,980
<i>That gives you a chance</i> <i>to think...</i>

382
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,260
and, please God, call it off.

383
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:42,220
Look, I'm the new boy here. Why me? Because you're single.

384
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,590
You should have done your homework, sport.

385
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:50,840
Page 255, Robbie's Odd Man Hypothesis.

386
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,800
"Results of testing confirm the Robertson Odd Man Hypothesis:

387
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,330
"that an unmarried male should carry out command decisions...

388
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,180
involving thermonuclear destruct contexts."

389
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,870
Let me take a look at that.

390
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,050
<i>It's of vital importance...</i>

391
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,630
that you always know where you are in relation to the nearest substation.

392
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,550
To do that, you have to be familiar with the entire facility.

393
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:22,360
It can be studied on this electronic diagram...

394
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:27,160
which rotates to afford an overall view, or can be stopped at any section.

395
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:34,770
<i>Detailed plans of</i> <i>the various levels and labs</i> <i>are also stored in the system.</i>

396
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,900
We're on level 1 of a five-story cylindrical underground structure...

397
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:45,240
surrounded by solid rock.

398
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,470
Each level has three substations, indicated by the yellow lights.

399
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,810
<i>In the event the nuclear device</i> <i>is triggered, you can</i> <i>still cancel self-destruct...</i>

400
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,020
<i>by inserting your red key</i> <i>in a substation.</i>

401
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:59,190
After our last simulation run,

402
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,550
we decided to add two more substations per level, but they're not finished.

403
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,400
So don't confuse them with functioning ones.

404
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:09,810
At the bottom of the central core is the apparatus for self-destruct.

405
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:17,110
Each level is a different color...

406
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:21,580
based on a navy study of the psychological effects of color in environments.

407
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:25,330
Also, each level is biomedically cleaner than the one above it.

408
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,750
We don't want anything to contaminate a possible organism.

409
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:32,600
That would make it twice as hard to isolate and characterize.

410
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,440
It'll take us 16 hours to descend...

411
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,250
through the programmed decontamination procedures on the first four levels...

412
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:43,570
to level 5 where the main labs are.

413
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,940
Where, exactly, are we now?

414
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,910
<i>There's one way you can always</i> <i>locate yourself or any of us instantly.</i>

415
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,050
Simply by calling up projections from the electronic diagram...

416
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,670
on any video monitor anywhere in Wildfire.

417
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,600
Views such as this.

418
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:01,240
This shows we're in conference room 7, level 1.

419
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,920
Each of us is indicated by our initial.

420
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:06,890
Our movements are continuously monitored on the electronic diagram.

421
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:10,200
- Where are the patients? - Where's the capsule?

422
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:13,140
The patients are the yellow X's.

423
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,250
The red circle is the capsule.

424
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:19,660
On level 5, the patients and capsule will be isolated in biologically secure setups.

425
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,550
Are you sure the old man and the baby are still alive?

426
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,370
What are their chances, Hall? Uncertain.

427
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,460
I'm hoping the intravenous dextrose and saline will hold them until we get to them.

428
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:49,460
We start decontamination and immunization procedures now.

429
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:57,910
You really expect me to fire the thing?

430
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,680
I'm afraid you don't understand.

431
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,120
All you can do is stop it.

432
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,800
In a biological emergency, the bomb is activated automatically.

433
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,800
It'll then go off within five minutes unless you get to a substation...

434
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:13,040
and lock in your key.

435
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,700
Oh.

436
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:21,680
<i>Delta Five to all levels.</i>

437
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:25,650
<i>We are checking out ray-ban</i> <i>emergency communications.</i> <i>This is a test.</i>

438
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:46,330
<i>Proceed to infrared radiation</i> <i>decontamination room 1-D.</i>

439
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:54,450
Also it could be an organism from another planet released deliberately.

440
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,530
To wipe us out? Really, Charles!

441
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,640
Just the opposite. To make friendly contact.

442
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:03,050
A kind of messenger to show us life exists elsewhere in the universe.

443
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:06,640
It could be benign in its own environment. Pretty far-fetched.

444
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:08,980
We can't ignore any possibility.

445
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:12,980
<i>You are about</i> <i>to undergo long-wave radiation.</i>

446
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:18,200
<i>A buzzer will sound.</i> <i>Close your eyes and stand still</i> <i>or blindness may result.</i>

447
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,030
We face quite a problem:

448
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,970
how to disinfect the human body, one of the dirtiest things in the known universe.

449
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:49,010
That is without killing the human being at the same time. It gets tougher as we go.

450
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,800
Hard on the taxpayers, the way we burn up uniforms.

451
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,770
They're paper.

452
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:56,180
I'd swear it was cloth. New process.

453
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:59,450
Where's the next substation, Hall? Left of elevator on level 2.

454
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:03,640
Right. Across the corridor from body analysis, our next port of call.

455
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,910
Not for my alabaster body.

456
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,880
I mean it, Stone. You can take your body analyzer and you can...

457
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:16,010
<i>Sit down, please.</i>

458
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,730
<i>Please look at the screen</i> <i>in front of you.</i>

459
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:30,260
<i>Please place your body</i> <i>so that all points</i> <i>are obliterated.</i>

460
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,460
<i>That is fine.</i> <i>We may proceed.</i>

461
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:44,730
<i>State your name for the records.</i> <i>Surname first.</i> Mark Hall.

462
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,070
Hall, Mark. <i>Thank you</i> <i>for your cooperation.</i>

463
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,050
Yes, dear.

464
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:59,470
<i>Please answer the following</i> <i>questions yes or no.</i>

465
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:02,640
<i>Have you any allergies?</i> Yes, to ragweed pollen.

466
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,360
Okay, I'll repeat for your memory cells...

467
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,970
<i>Please repeat your response</i> <i>for our memory cells.</i>

468
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,790
Ragweed pollen!

469
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:19,280
<i>This ends</i> <i>the formal questioning.</i> <i>Please undress.</i>

470
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,790
<i>This is a scan</i> <i>for fungal lesions.</i>

471
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:42,290
<i>Dr. Stone,</i> <i>this is level 2 control.</i> <i>The answer is affirmative.</i>

472
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:46,870
<i>Major Manchek</i> <i>contacted the White House</i> <i>at 11:23 this morning.</i>

473
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:51,930
<i>Contact on all leads</i> <i>is "R" for ready.</i>

474
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:56,470
<i>Do not be nervous.</i> I'm not nervous.

475
00:47:57,530 --> 00:47:59,800
<i>Physical parameters</i> <i>are being measured.</i>

476
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:03,480
<i>There's no need to be nervous,</i> <i>Dr. Leavitt.</i>

477
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:08,270
<i>Please raise your left arm.</i>

478
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:19,610
<i>Please sit up,</i> <i>facing the scan screen</i> <i>and watch carefully.</i>

479
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:46,070
<i>You have received</i> <i>pneumatic injections</i> <i>of booster immunizations.</i>

480
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,400
<i>You may get dressed.</i> <i>Thank you.</i>

481
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:50,990
<i>This recording is now ended.</i>

482
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:00,430
That body analyzer! I want to be there when the A.M.A. gets wind of it.

483
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,150
So far it's only been used by NASA to diagnose astronauts in space.

484
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:06,900
You doctors better start making house calls again.

485
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:17,560
<i>This is a xenon lamp apparatus.</i>

486
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:22,230
<i>To insure</i> <i>complete effectiveness,</i> <i>spread your feet apart.</i>

487
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,690
<i>To protect scalp</i> <i>and facial hair,</i>

488
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:30,580
<i>place the metal helmet</i> <i>securely on the head.</i>

489
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:39,510
<i>Make sure the helmet</i> <i>is firmly seated</i> <i>and the visor lowered.</i>

490
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:42,360
<i>Then raise your arms</i> <i>and wait.</i>

491
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:03,820
<i>You may now remove helmet.</i>

492
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:08,790
<i>You will notice a fine white ash</i> <i>on your body.</i>

493
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:13,430
<i>This is the outer</i> <i>epithelial layers of your skin</i> <i>that have been burned away.</i>

494
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:19,890
<i>Please replace the helmet</i> <i>in compartment and proceed</i> <i>through shower in next room.</i>

495
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,810
<i>Then you may dress</i> <i>and descend to level 4.</i>

496
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:33,140
We're required to rest for six hours on level 4 after exposure to the xenon lamp.

497
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:35,250
So go to your rooms and sleep.

498
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,810
At the end of the corridor is the cafeteria.

499
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,330
We'll meet there at 0400 hours... tomorrow.

500
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:47,820
<i>Pharmacology</i> <i>to maintenance L.B.</i>

501
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:52,170
<i>One of our R.F.s shows</i> <i>six points over nominal</i> <i>at pressure 3.</i>

502
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:59,980
<i>Watchdog to all levels.</i> <i>Scoop 7 capsule secure.</i>

503
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:03,950
<i>Biocheck 66</i> <i>plus 9 minus OL-5.</i>

504
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,500
<i>LEO control to KEEPSAKE 5.</i>

505
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:24,690
<i>The pressure integrity check</i> <i>runs 2.54 G-CM to the second.</i>

506
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,630
<i>Please confirm.</i>

507
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:01,680
A new form of life.

508
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:06,290
Like Rudolph Karp's bacteria.

509
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,120
Fools!

510
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:11,730
They refuse to believe life exists in meteorites.

511
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,480
I showed them at the Astrophysics Conference what I just showed you.

512
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:19,060
But no, even with a microscope, they are blind.

513
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,360
What do I have to do? Hit them over the head?

514
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,860
I'm glad you're amused, gentlemen, but it might just turn out to be true.

515
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:46,420
During this symposium, we'll discuss the possibility...

516
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:48,820
that intelligent life on a distant planet...

517
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:52,370
may be no larger than a flea.

518
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,980
Perhaps no larger than a bacterium.

519
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:02,390
<i>Time to wake up, sir.</i>

520
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:05,360
<i>Time to wake up, sir!</i>

521
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,510
Hello?

522
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:14,190
<i>Time to wake up, sir.</i>

523
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:19,700
Who are you? <i>Time to wake up, sir.</i>

524
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,730
Do you wish something, sir?

525
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,690
Your name.

526
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:32,530
Will that be all, sir?

527
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,450
For the moment.

528
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:58,220
<i>This is the</i> <i>answering service supervisor.</i>

529
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,780
<i>We wish you would adopt</i> <i>a more serious attitude, Dr. Hall.</i>

530
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:04,340
Sorry. Her voice is quite luscious.

531
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:08,560
<i>The voice belongs</i> <i>to Miss Gladys Stevens</i> <i>who is 63 years old.</i>

532
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:13,270
<i>She lives in Omaha and</i> <i>makes her living taping messages</i> <i>for voice-reminder systems.</i>

533
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,670
Much obliged.

534
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:19,380
<i>Let's not get sidetracked</i> <i>on Rudolph Karp</i> <i>and his meteorite theories.</i>

535
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:21,360
His technique was worthless!

536
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:24,750
I still think we should contact him. Fair enough. Where is he?

537
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:28,240
Behind the Iron Curtain. He couldn't get a research grant here.

538
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,600
<i>H.P. nutrient now available</i> <i>in the cafeteria...</i>

539
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:38,770
<i>for staff members</i> <i>from sectors 1 through 6.</i>

540
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,940
Hemlock! All for you, Hippocrates.

541
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:43,950
Not your own venom?

542
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:48,280
Tastes like orange juice.

543
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:50,350
Nutrient 42-5.

544
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,150
Developed for the astronauts.

545
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,870
Eight ounces satisfy all daily nutritional requirements.

546
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,720
Except coffee.

547
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:59,090
And lipid soluble vitamins.

548
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,580
For that we have these. Help yourself.

549
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,860
So what's the point of the cafeteria?

550
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:08,050
Wildfire isn't always on crash status. Maybe there's some sugar.

551
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:11,020
Nope. Nothing that might provide a bacterial growth medium.

552
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,980
Precisely. No sugar in the gut.

553
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:15,220
I'd like a cigarette right now.

554
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:18,520
It's after meals you miss 'em. <i>You should have</i> <i>no trouble on level 5.</i>

555
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,790
You won't even get this close to a meal.

556
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:23,220
We'll be entirely on high-protein nutrients.

557
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:25,560
I planned our work in three stages.

558
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,510
One: detection.

559
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:30,160
First step is to confirm that an organism is present.

560
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:33,680
Two: characterization. How's it structured, how does it work?

561
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,400
Three: control.

562
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:38,860
How to contain and exterminate?

563
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:42,280
Jeremy, on this matter of extermination, we should go slowly.

564
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:46,390
Without ever realizing it, we might destroy a highly intelligent form of life.

565
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:49,270
Why don't we get going? I've got two patients down there.

566
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:52,400
- The team has two subjects. - They're not guinea pigs, Stone.

567
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:57,070
<i>You may now proceed to level 5,</i> <i>gentlemen.</i>

568
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:07,630
Um, stop by your rooms and insert these before taking the elevator.

569
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:10,320
I have risked drowning in that foul bath.

570
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:13,970
I have been parboiled, irradiated and xenon flashed. And now you suggest I...

571
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,760
I have to! We haven't done anything about the G.I. tract yet.

572
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:19,920
On level 5 we must be as nearly germ free as possible.

573
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:24,980
Anyone care to join me for a smoke?

574
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,140
<i>Watchdog to level 2, sector D.</i>

575
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:31,540
<i>You are</i> <i>Red Kappa Phoenix status.</i>

576
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,150
<i>Off the main corridor</i> <i>on the outer rim...</i>

577
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:40,310
<i>are the living quarters,</i> <i>conference room, cafeteria,</i> <i>bio-safety maintenance, etc.</i>

578
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,320
<i>Inside are the labs.</i>

579
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:44,600
Where is the library?

580
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,860
No need for books. Everything's in the computer.

581
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:50,320
Notice the capsule has already been delivered...

582
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:55,890
<i>by the sterile</i> <i>conveyor system to</i> <i>the main control lab here.</i>

583
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:59,120
<i>Your patients are here</i> <i>in the hot room</i> <i>of miscellaneous.</i>

584
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:01,880
We can't have any direct contact with them. Poor souls.

585
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:06,320
<i>Dr. Dutton</i> <i>and Dr. Hall are wanted</i> <i>in main control immediately.</i>

586
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:10,510
<i>Hey!</i>

587
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:13,550
If the patients are sealed off, how do I get to them?

588
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,530
Ever used a glove box? No.

589
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:17,680
Wildfire's gone a step further.

590
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,120
Whole rooms that operate like glove boxes.

591
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,040
You'll be working in one shortly.

592
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:37,520
<i>We have a magnetic "K" indices.</i> <i>Give us a code 3</i> <i>when you get it.</i>

593
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,690
I wanted you here while we find out...

594
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:58,480
if there's anything still biologically active in the capsule.

595
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:00,920
Suggestions? Use a buffalo.

596
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,090
Audio.

597
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,980
<i>Detectors "E" through "G"</i> <i>correction.</i>

598
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:29,140
<i>Negative "N" scan.</i> <i>Negative "N" scope in LY-1.</i>

599

<i>Affirmative.</i> <i>"N" indicator in MP-4.</i> <i>I will repeat.</i>

<i>Affirmative.</i> <i>"N indicator in MP-4.</i>

602
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:06,700
Whatever killed them at Piedmont is still there and still as potent as ever.

603
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:09,780
If potent's the word. Let's try a rhesus.

604
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:12,300
Yeah. We'll want a postmortem on it anyway.

605
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,550
<i>Housekeeping to level 5.</i>

606
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:28,140
<i>Clean sweep schedule "B"</i> <i>now in effect.</i>

607
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:32,080
<i>Germfree animal technicians,</i> <i>please consult schedule "A."</i>

608
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:26,230
So, okay. Isolate and identify.

609
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:29,200
Right. You and I'll scan the capsule, Ruth.

610
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:33,100
Charlie, you work on these in autopsy. Open the S.L., Ruth.

611
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:04,310
<i>Adjust S.Y. system for</i> <i>aseptricity as follows.</i>

612

<i>Points 2-A at 5.</i> <i>Points 9 through 12 at plus 1.</i>

613
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:11,920
<i>Plus 3, plus 6 at minus.</i>

614
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,250
Run an initial vector study, Charlie.

615
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:52,600
Find out how the disease enters the body.

616
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:57,460
<i>Charlie?</i> Yes.

617
01:01:57,530 --> 01:02:02,380
Yes, the vector study first, then autopsy. Incredible.

618
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,380
Dutton, be careful.

619
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:09,520
Let our distinguished surgeon handle the knife.

620
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:12,530
Fine, but not for a while.

621
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:16,110
First, I'm a pediatrician and a geriatrist.

622
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:19,790
Take it easy. Charlie will have a technician.

623
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,580
What's been done for them?

624
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,410
Just plasma for the old man, dextrose for the baby.

625
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:43,870
- Your therapy? - No. Medcom's.

626
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:46,360
Do I call you Miss Medcom?

627
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,820
If you like, Dr. Hall. My name's Karen Anson.

628
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:54,680
Good. I couldn't cope with two machines. How does this work?

629
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:58,470
You're lucky. Medcom's got one of the best minds here.

630
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:02,310
It's a medical data analyzer that can diagnose as well as prescribe.

631
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:05,370
It's hooked up to the main computer on level 1.

632
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:08,090
Every console and instrument in Wildfire...

633
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:11,360
is plugged into the main computer on a time-sharing basis.

634
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:14,080
All our key lab studies are done on automated machines.

635
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:16,010
I prefer the personal touch.

636
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:18,070
It's hard to come by in those suits.

637
01:03:19,305 --> 01:03:25,292
