2
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:16,168
Come on, get that sun lamp ready.

3
00:01:16,169 --> 00:01:19,169
About 15 minutes is the most I'd advise,
 Mr. Warriner.

4
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:21,968
 Fifteen minutes nothing! l need
a deep Florida tan if it takes all afternoon.

5
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:24,969
Give her the gun.

6
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:27,408
 All aboard for Miami,
Palm Beach and Point South.

7
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:29,168
 -Hi, Jerry.
-Hello, Frank.

8
00:01:29,169 --> 00:01:31,648
-How goes it?
 -Fine!

9
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:34,649
-Like to play a little squash?
 -No, thanks.

10
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:38,289
 You're awfully white-skinned
for a guy who spent two weeks in Florida.

11
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:41,489
 -That's what l thought.
-What did you do there, carry a parasol?

12
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:45,648
 -Or didn't you go?
-Don't go spreading that around, Frank.

13
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:48,649
Pulling a fast one on the little wife?

14
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,048
 Frank, l'm surprised at you.
l'm supposed to have been in Florida.

15
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,888
Supposing one of Lucy's friends
 says to her:

16
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:57,288
''Well, why isn't he tanned?''
 Lucy will be embarrassed.

17
00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:00,289
 l'll be tanned,
and Lucy won't be embarrassed.

18
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,168
What wives don't know won't hurt them.
 What you don't know won't hurt you.

19
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:06,528
 l don't want to know.
How about coming by the house?

20
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:09,529
Some friends are coming by
 for a late breakfast.

21
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,289
l got a better idea. Come to my place
 for eggnogs and breakfast...

22
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:15,648
and maybe later we can duck the women
 and play some golf.

23
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:18,649
-Swell, boy, you got me convinced.
 -Okay.

24
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:20,488
-See you later, Jerry.
 -So long, Frank.

25
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:23,489
Come on in!

26
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:25,448
Hey, Lucy!

27
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:27,408
That man is here.

28
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:30,409
Maybe she wasn't expecting you.

29
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:33,568
 No, she's around somewhere.
Put your things down anywhere.

30
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:36,288
 -Hello, Celeste.
-Hello, Mr. Warriner, you look well.

31
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:39,289
Thank you, Celeste, and vice versa.

32
00:02:39,649 --> 00:02:42,649
Where's Mrs. Warriner? Look what l got her
 all the way from Florida.

33
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:46,169
-She's out.
-She's out?

34
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:49,529
 Never mind. Go get some eggnogs,
and we'll find something to drink to.

35
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:54,729
Come on, gang, enter.

36
00:02:56,769 --> 00:02:59,408
Mr. Smith, look who's here.

37
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:00,848
Come on, boy.

38
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:03,849
Where's Mamma?

39
00:03:04,369 --> 00:03:07,369
Look, l've got something for you.

40
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:13,168
Come on, get it.

41
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:16,169
What are you doing, reading my mail?

42
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:22,528
Several letters there for your wife.
 Yesterday's, too.

43
00:03:22,529 --> 00:03:25,529
 l hope Lucy comes back
looking as well as you do.

44
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:31,128
 She's probably up at her Aunt Patsy's.
She always goes there when she's lonely.

45
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:32,608
Thank you, Celeste, l'll take it up from here.

46
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:35,128
-Jerry.
-What?

47
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:38,129
Supposing Aunt Patsy wasn't home?

48
00:03:38,249 --> 00:03:41,249
l get it. l'm up to my neck in funny people!

49
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:46,049
 Seriously, l wish Lucy would go out and
get some fun now and again. Do her good.

50
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:50,849
That's the trouble with marriages today.
 People are always imagining things.

51
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:53,408
The road to Reno is paved with suspicions.

52
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:56,328
 First thing you know,
they're in a divorce court.

53
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:59,329
The broad-minded man from the Rio Grande!

54
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,449
 lf you think l'll get a chance to prove my
broad-mindedness any minute, you're crazy.

55
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:06,489
Lucy's up at her Aunt Patsy's cabin.
 l'll bet on it.

56
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:10,009
lncidentally, what a swell spot that is.
 Good fishing....

57
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:20,889
Sometimes, on a clear day across that lake,
 you can see for....

58
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:28,929
Mrs. Barnsley, Miss Heath,
Mr. Barnsley, Mr. Randall.

59
00:04:29,489 --> 00:04:32,489
Aunt Patsy.

60
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:45,769
How grand and brown you are!
 Hello, Patsy, dear.

61
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:49,209
-Did you miss me? Been thinking about me?
 -Look what l brought you!

62
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:55,409
All the way from Florida? Bless your heart!

63
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:58,809
You know Armand Duvalle, dear.

64
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:01,168
Come on in, Armand.

65
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:03,848
Mr. Duvalle, this is my aunt, Miss Adams.

66
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:05,808
 Mr. and Mrs. Barnsley,
Miss Heath and Mr. Randall.

67
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:08,528
We've had the most terrible time.

68
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:11,529
Armand's car broke down last night
 miles from nowhere...

69
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,729
and we had to stay at the nastiest inn ever.
 No modern conveniences. lt was dreadful!

70
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:19,609
We were coming home from the junior prom.
 Armand's pupil invited us.

71
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:23,689
Oh, it's a long story, but l must....
 Hello, there!

72
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:26,648
Your wife, she was the loveliest woman
 in the party.

73
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:28,528
Armand, you always say the nicest things.

74
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:31,528
lsn't that cute? Did you bring him that?

75
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:34,529
 -Yes--
-Go catch it!

76
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:39,729
 -Were you disappointed l wasn't here?
-Not at all. After all, you didn't expect me.

77
00:05:40,609 --> 00:05:43,609
 And you'll forgive me
for my car's imperfect performance?

78
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:47,888
 Of course.
l'm sorry the inn was so inconvenient.

79
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,889
That's the only thing that bothers me.

80
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:54,368
 You know, your husband
is not like the average American man.

81
00:05:54,369 --> 00:05:57,369
He's free of all mean suspicion.

82
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:00,689
He has more the Continental mind. Yes?

83
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:04,329
That's right, l have a Continental mind.
 Will you have an eggnog?

84
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:10,969
Thank you.

85
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:14,809
l don't know what kind of a mind Jerry's got,
 Continental or cockeyed...

86
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:18,049
 but he's a wonder.
Now, if l stayed out all night...

87
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:21,849
and waltzed in with handsome Mr. Duvalle,
 and said the car broke down....

88
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:25,009
lt did. Why should Jerry be angry?
 l didn't build the car.

89
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:28,129
-You're perfectly right, dear.
 -Of course l am.

90
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:29,928
Can't have a happy married life
 if you're always suspicious.

91
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:32,528
Right again.

92
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:35,529
-A little nutmeg?
 -Please.

93
00:06:36,489 --> 00:06:39,489
-Why am l boring you with private matters?
 -We're not bored.

94
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:43,049
No one's interested in my adventure
but Jerry, who knows it's innocent...

95
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:48,689
 just as well as he knows
that he just got back from Florida.

96
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:51,888
l see what you mean.

97
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:54,889
More drinks, everybody? There's lots left.

98
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:59,369
-No, thank you, l think we better be going.
 -You don't all have to go, do you?

99
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:02,809
Go? No.

100
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:06,129
-Well, it's silly to go so soon.
 -We must go, really.

101
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:09,088
 Patsy, dear, where are you going?
l haven't even had a chance to talk to you.

102
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:12,089
l'll see you later, my dear.

103
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:16,289
l always say four's a crowd.

104
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:24,208
There's something in what she says.

105
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:27,209
Thank you.

106
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:29,968
 -Say, are you hungry?
-To tell you the truth, l'm starved.

107
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:32,969
Why don't you go out and grab a bite?

108
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:37,848
-A strong fellow should take care of himself.
 -Why, what have l done?

109
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:39,768
-lf you speak of last night, l assure you--
 -You don't believe--

110
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:42,769
We'll discuss it in private.

111
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:46,649
That is if Mr. Duvalle can remember
 where we keep our door.

112
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:50,008
ln all fairness, you should permit me
 to remain and explain ourselves.

113
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:52,728
 American women
aren't accustomed to gallantry.

114
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:55,128
 l appreciate your offer,
but maybe you'd better go.

115
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:57,528
Pardon me, Mrs. Warriner,
 you misunderstand.

116
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:00,529
l am a voice teacher, am l not?

117
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:05,609
 For one year she has been my pupil.
And from time to time, l pat her on the back.

118
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:08,088
l mean, l congratulate her on her...

119
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:10,888
-development.
 -ls that so?

120
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:13,889
 -Do l express myself?
-You've been doing all right.

121
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:17,968
But now my position must be considered.
 l have never yet been in a scandal.

122
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:20,888
-Never been caught?
 -No.

123
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:23,889
l am a great teacher, not a great lover.

124
00:08:24,929 --> 00:08:27,929
That's right, Armand, no one could ever
 accuse you of being a great lover.

125
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:31,689
 That is, l mean to say,
who's to say whether you are or not?

126
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:35,769
 lt's all so silly!
But maybe you had better go.

127
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:40,129
 -l really don't know what to say.
-lf you go, you won't have to say anything.

128
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,088
-Perhaps it is best this way, Mrs. Warriner.
 -l think so.

129
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,808
-l will see you soon?
 -Yes.

130
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:48,888
lt has been all so perfect.

131
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:50,408
Thank you for everything.

132
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:53,288
Take another bow.

133
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:56,289
 Not a bad performance
considering no rehearsals or anything.

134
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:04,369
 Why, Mr. Warriner,
you're out of your Continental mind.

135
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:08,529
That was funny, what he said
about your Continental mind.

136
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:12,088
-No doubt he has a better sense of humour.
 -No, l beg to differ.

137
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:13,888
Right now you're twice as funny as him.

138
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:15,888
-Quit stalling, Lucy.
 -l'm not--

139
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,889
Perhaps our marriage means nothing to you.

140
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:24,689
Perhaps you have no sentiment left for me.
 Look at this.

141
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:28,888
 Look, a letter l wrote you.
Did you care when you read it? No!

142
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:31,889
You knew there'd be a letter
 every morning...

143
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:35,209
 but you were far too busy
with Armand Duvalle to give it a thought.

144
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,168
lt's enough to destroy one's faith, isn't it?

145
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:40,928
l haven't any faith left in anyone.

146
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:43,929
l know just how you feel.

147
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:53,409
What do you mean?

148
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:57,649
You didn't mention in any of your letters
 the terrible rainy spell in Florida.

149
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:01,289
The papers were full of it.

150
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:04,369
-l can explain that, Lucy.
 -You can?

151
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,689
 Don't try to change the subject.
You think a great offence is a great defence.

152
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:11,889
Don't try to justify your behaviour
 by insinuating things about me.

153
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:14,969
l haven't any behaviour to justify.
 l've just been unlucky.

154
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:18,608
 You caught me in a truth, and it seems
there's nothing less logical than the truth.

155
00:10:18,609 --> 00:10:20,848
 -A philosopher?
-You don't believe me.

156
00:10:20,849 --> 00:10:23,168
How can l believe you?
''The car broke down.''

157
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:25,568
People stopped believing that ages ago.

158
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:28,248
-His car's very old.
 -So is his story.

159
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:30,808
-Let me tell you something.
-Let me tell you something.

160
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:33,808
l told you the truth about all this, Jerry.

161
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:36,809
 Don't you see?
There can't be any doubt in marriage.

162
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:40,448
 The whole thing's built on faith.
lf you've lost that, you've lost everything.

163
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:42,168
 When that's gone
the marriage is washed up.

164
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:44,368
-Do you mean that?
 -Yes.

165
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:47,369
-Then that settles it.
 -l guess it does.

166
00:10:47,609 --> 00:10:49,608
l wouldn't go on living with you
if you were dipped in platinum.

167
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:52,609
So divorce me. lt'll be a pleasure.

168
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:57,289
You think l'd drag that music lover to court
 to show people the man you preferred?

169
00:10:57,689 --> 00:11:00,689
 Then l'll divorce you.
lt's customary for the wife to bring suit.

170
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:03,568
 lt has something to do
with the husband being a gentleman.

171
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:06,569
Just get on with the divorce proceedings.
 l can't wait.

172
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:09,609
-l'll call our lawyer right now.
 -All right, here.

173
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:13,689
You don't mind? l don't know anyone else.
 You get around much more than l do.

174
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:21,088
ls that so?

175
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:23,208
Hello?

176
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:24,688
Hello, Lucy.

177
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:27,689
What's that?

178
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,729
Divorce? You and Jerry?

179
00:11:31,849 --> 00:11:34,849
Don't do anything in haste
 you might regret later.

180
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:38,849
-Marriage is a beautiful thing, and you--
 -Can't she call back after we've eaten?

181
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:41,929
Please be quiet, will you?

182
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:45,009
You seem agitated, Lucy.
 Try and calm yourself.

183
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:48,488
l'd hate to see you take any hasty action
 in a matter like this.

184
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:51,489
-Marriage is a beautiful thing, and you--
 -Finish your meal.

185
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:55,529
-Why can't they call you back later?
 -Will you shut your mouth?

186
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:58,609
 As l was saying, Lucy,
marriage is a beautiful thing.

187
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:01,969
When you've been married as long as l,
 you'll appreciate it, too.

188
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:05,369
 Your food's getting ice-cold.
You always complain about your food.

189
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:08,569
 Just shut your big mouth.
l'll eat when l'm good and ready.

190
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:14,009
 lf you don't like it,
you know what you can do. So shut up!

191
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:22,649
Marriage is a beautiful thing.

192
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:27,449
You see? Because you were a naughty dog,
 they made you leave the room. Come on.

193
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:30,489
ln the case of Warriner v, Warriner,
 the court grants...

194
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:34,009
 an interlocutory decree of divorce
in favour of the plaintiff, Lucy Warriner.

195
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:37,889
The divorce, without further contesting,
will become final 90 days from this day.

196
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:42,329
Plaintiff and defendant then have the liberty
 to make other marriages, if they so desire.

197
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:45,889
Your Honour, there's a matter still unsettled.

198
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:49,248
-The matter about....
 -Mr. Smith.

199
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:52,249
-Yes, Your Honour, Mr. Smith.
 -Who is Mr. Smith?

200
00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:54,928
 -Mr. Smith is their dog.
-No, Mr. Smith is my dog.

201
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:57,728
-ls that so?
 -Silence!

202
00:12:57,729 --> 00:12:59,528
But, you see, Mr. Smith belongs to me,
 and she has him.

203
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,808
Very well, go ahead.

204
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:04,809
The animal is in Mrs. Warriner's possession.

205
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:08,449
You ordered him from the courtroom
 at the beginning, for contempt.

206
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:11,488
-Mr. Warriner wishes to have him because....
 -Because he's mine!

207
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:14,489
-He is not.
-He is, too.

208
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:17,648
-He is not.
 -Silence!

209
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:20,649
ls not.

210
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:23,769
Mrs. Warriner, step up and tell me
 why you regard the dog...

211
00:13:24,689 --> 00:13:27,689
 as your personal property, so the court
may decide if he should remain with you.

212
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:30,008
Nothing would please me more.

213
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,009
Your Honour, l saw Mr. Smith first.

214
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:36,089
lt was in that pet shop on Madison Avenue.
 You know it?

215
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:41,409
-You don't? lt's between 47th and....
 -lt's frightfully immaterial.

216
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:44,849
 Well, you ought to know.
l decided to buy Mr. Smith...

217
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,409
 but l turned away for a moment
to look at a Persian kitten. Do you like cats?

218
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:54,089
l don't either. So l turned around again,
and this man had Mr. Smith in his arms.

219
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:58,689
l said, ''Pardon me, l'm buying this puppy.''
 And then he just smiled at me.

220
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:01,809
 Then somehow, suddenly,
the three of us were having lunch...

221
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:05,008
 the man, and Mr. Smith, and l.
And then things happened swiftly...

222
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:08,009
so l said, ''We'd better get married,''
 and we did.

223
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:11,368
 That way we could give Mr. Smith
a better home and live happily ever after.

224
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:13,528
-Until now.
 -l see.

225
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:16,529
ln these custody cases, Mrs. Warriner...

226
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:19,448
 we often allow the final decision
to rest with the party in question.

227
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:22,449
You mean Mr. Smith?

228
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:25,849
Send for the dog.

229
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:30,529
 Custody of the dog
will depend on his own desire.

230
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:41,209
-Mr. Warriner, will you step up here, please?
 -Yes, Your Honour.

231
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,128
Unfasten him.

232
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:49,129
You may each call the dog.

233
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:58,168
-Mr. Smith, come on, boy.
 -Smitty, look up here.

234
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:01,169
Don't pay attention. Come on, boy.

235
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:08,089
Look up here. You know me.

236
00:15:11,849 --> 00:15:13,248
-Smitty, look up here.
 -No, don't!

237
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:16,128
l win.

238
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:19,129
 Custody of the dog
is awarded to Mrs. Warriner.

239
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:21,688
 Your Honour, that's not quite fair.
l ought to see the dog twice a month or so.

240
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:24,689
-l'll take it under advisement.
 -Goodbye.

241
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:27,328
Thank you. Goodbye.

242
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:30,329
Goodbye, Your Honour.

243
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:34,169
-You won't forget to do that, Judge?
 -l'll take it under advisement.

244
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:42,528
Yes, but when will you know?

245
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:45,529
Look at that rain!

246
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,529
-Why, is it doing anything besides falling?
 -l don't think so.

247
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:52,608
Nothing unusual ever happens around here.

248
00:15:52,609 --> 00:15:55,609
Patsy, l'm sorry you're so bored tonight.

249
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:58,649
Why tonight? l've been bored for a month.

250
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:03,089
lf l'd known we'd be buried side by side
 l'd never have taken this apartment.

251
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:07,289
l wouldn't have asked you to come
and live with me if l'd known that...

252
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:11,489
 a sort of readjustment
takes place after divorce.

253
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:15,769
 Readjustment my foot!
That's just another word for moping around.

254
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:19,209
 Don't be silly.
Anyhow, where can two women go alone?

255
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:23,209
 You know dozens of men
who'd turn handsprings to take you out.

256
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:26,128
l've got you all dressed up, ready to go out,
 and you weaken and refuse.

257
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:29,129
You're just an old grouch.

258
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:30,968
l want to go where there's life.
 And l don't mean plant life.

259
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:33,969
l want to go to the theatre.

260
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:37,009
 You know, go places later
and step around and do things.

261
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:38,728
-But you can't go in all this rain.
 -Why not, no taxis?

262
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:41,729
No escort.

263
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:44,848
 Unless there's a new ruling,
l don't need an escort to get a drink.

264
00:16:44,849 --> 00:16:47,808
l'm going down to the bar and see Joe.

265
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:50,648
Bartender or no bartender, he's still a man.

266
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:53,649
-Maybe he knocks off early.
 -Patsy, you wouldn't!

267
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:56,768
 l wouldn't?
You're talking to a desperate woman.

268
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:59,769
Hello, Smitty, come on up, boy.

269
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:05,769
 -lsn't he cute?
-Too bad he can't wear a top hat.

270
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:41,569
Did you hear what she said?

271
00:17:59,969 --> 00:18:02,969
-l wonder if you'd do me a favour?
 -Well, of course, that all depends.

272
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:06,809
lmagine you living right across the hall
 from us all of this time.

273
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:17,408
l think it's just wonderful
 that we've met this way.

274
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:20,409
Lucy, may l present Mr. Leeson?

275
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:23,168
This is my niece you wanted to meet.
 Her name is Lucy Warriner.

276
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:26,169
How do you do?

277
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:29,369
-Won't you sit down?
 -Thanks.

278
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:33,129
Mr. Leeson's just from Oklahoma, Lucy.
 He's a stranger in town.

279
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:36,968
 He'd take it as real neighbourly of us
if we show him some of the bright spots.

280
00:18:36,969 --> 00:18:39,288
He would?

281
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:42,289
lt's raining awfully hard. l don't think--

282
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,689
 That's just exactly what l said,
''l don't think the rain will stop us.''

283
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:49,849
Besides, l think it'll let up in a few minutes,
 Miss Warriner.

284
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,128
 Mr. Leeson's a neighbour.
He lives across the hall with his mother.

285
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:55,488
-That's what you said, right?
 -Yes, with my mother.

286
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:58,489
We're here on a visit. l'm in oil, you know.

287
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:01,689
Marinated, so to speak.

288
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:06,889
 Say, that's a good one!
l got to remember to tell that to my mother.

289
00:19:08,209 --> 00:19:10,648
Mr. Leeson, won't you tell us
something about Oklahoma?

290
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,649
Oklahoma's pretty swell.

291
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:18,329
 l got quite a ranch down there.
Like you to see it sometime, Miss Warriner.

292
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:21,609
l don't get out there very....

293
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:31,528
 l got cattle and horses
and chickens and alfalfa and--

294
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:34,529
 -Hello, Jerry.
-Patsy, how are things?

295
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:41,568
-We weren't expecting you.
 -Why, what goes on?

296
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:44,008
Hiya, fellow! Mr. Smith, how have you been?

297
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:46,408
l'll see you in a minute, boy. Yeah, sure.

298
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:48,328
-Hello, Jerry.
-Hello, Lucy.

299
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:51,128
What might you be doing here?

300
00:19:51,129 --> 00:19:54,129
 Have you forgotten
this is my day to visit Mr. Smith?

301
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:00,409
lt says so right there.

302
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:05,969
 l'm so sorry.
Mr. Leeson, this is my husband.

303
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:09,209
 He's only my husband for,
how much longer is it now, 60 days?

304
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:12,369
 -Fifty-nine.
-That's better, only 59 days.

305
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:18,529
And don't worry about him,
 he has a Continental mind.

306
00:20:18,689 --> 00:20:20,528
-Excuse me, what did you say?
 -l'm glad to know you.

307
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:23,529
How can you be glad to know me?

308
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:25,728
l know how l'd feel if l was with a girl
 and her husband walked in.

309
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:28,729
l'll bet you do.

310
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:32,088
l don't think you ought to go around
 telling people you're not married.

311
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:35,089
 He looks a nice fellow.
How do you think he feels?

312
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:39,889
 -Why don't you go play with the dog?
-You go on with whatever you were doing.

313
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,609
Don't mind me.

314
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:48,688
Any new dogs in the neighbourhood?
 Been chasing any cats?

315
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:51,689
Sit down, Mr. Leeson.

316
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:54,809
-Tell me some more about Arizona.
 -Oklahoma.

317
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,968
l mean Oklahoma. That's me for you!

318
00:20:59,969 --> 00:21:02,969
ls he getting enough to eat lately?
 He doesn't look well.

319
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:08,689
You don't look so hot yourself.

320
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:19,208
l don't think he's getting enough exercise.
 He's got circles under his eyes.

321
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:22,209
 -The court ruled--
-What about a tune, boy?

322
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:25,849
 Yes. You see,
there's nothing we can do about it.

323
00:21:32,729 --> 00:21:35,729
Don't worry about it, Mr. Leeson.
 Go right ahead.

324
00:21:39,489 --> 00:21:42,489
-My main business is oil.
 -Oil?

325
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,328
Sing it!

326
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:50,329
l do pretty well.

327
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:53,849
l have a ranch. My hobby is horses.

328
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:05,009
Hobby horses!

329
00:22:10,649 --> 00:22:13,649
Come on, let's get out of here.

330
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:28,168
 -Goodbye, Jerry.
-Goodbye, Warriner.

331
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:31,169
What's the matter?

332
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:34,609
-Are you sure you don't like that fellow?
 -Like him!

333
00:22:35,209 --> 00:22:38,209
-You saw how l treated him, didn't you?
 -That's what l mean.

334
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:41,648
On my ranch l got a little red rooster
 and a little brown hen...

335
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:44,649
and they fight all the time, too.

336
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:55,209
But once in a while, they make up again,
 and they're right friendly.

337
00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:57,928
 -'Morning, Ma.
-Well? lt was daylight when you came in.

338
00:22:57,929 --> 00:23:00,808
l had a wonderful time. l met a girl--

339
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:02,048
 That's what l thought.
You keep your mind off women.

340
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:05,049
l can't, Ma.

341
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:08,369
 You can't?
That's what your father always said.

342
00:23:08,689 --> 00:23:11,689
Of course l like Dan Leeson. Why not?
 He's sweet and thoughtful.

343
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:15,009
You should be the last one to object,
 you introduced him to me.

344
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:19,009
 He was a man who could take us out.
l didn't expect you to get silly about him.

345
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:22,008
There's nothing wrong in liking a man
 who's sane and considerate.

346
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:24,528
 l was married to one
who was insane and inconsiderate.

347
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:26,448
Your toast is burning.

348
00:23:26,449 --> 00:23:28,048
-What's her name?
 -Lucy Warriner.

349
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:30,808
Probably an alias.

350
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,809
You'll laugh for talking that way
 when you meet Lucy.

351
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:37,568
She won't want to meet me. She knows
 any woman could see through her.

352
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:40,569
Don't talk that way about Lucy.
 l'm crazy about her.

353
00:23:40,689 --> 00:23:42,288
l believe she kind of likes me, too.
 l think l'm in love.

354
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:45,289
Do you know what rebound is?

355
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:49,729
 Trying to get over one love
by bouncing into love with somebody else.

356
00:23:50,649 --> 00:23:53,649
lt's fine, except the rebound is rarely
 the real thing. ln fact, it's the bunk.

357
00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:56,248
There's the first bounce, the second, and....
 Well, look at me.

358
00:23:56,249 --> 00:23:59,249
You wind up like an old tennis ball.

359
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:01,888
l'm serious about Dan Leeson.
 l like him very much.

360
00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:04,568
l'm all through with Jerry,
 he means nothing.

361
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:07,569
l don't love him, and l probably never did.

362
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:11,528
l'm sure l never loved him. Now l hate him.
 That surprises you, doesn't it?

363
00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:14,529
 l hate Jerry Warriner
and l like Dan Leeson very much.

364
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:17,809
 l hope he's crazy about me,
because he's the finest man l've met.

365
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:29,129
l know, my toast is burning.

366
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:33,768
 You're awful sweet and all that,
but your mind's always on something else.

367
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:36,769
Or maybe someone else. ls it, sugar pie?

368
00:24:36,969 --> 00:24:39,969
No, l'm in love with love.

369
00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:44,089
 ''ln the spring,
a young man's fancy lightly turns to''...

370
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:46,528
what he's been thinking about all winter.

371
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:48,168
How long have you talked
 like Amos and Andy?

372
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:51,048
For quite some time.

373
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:54,049
 l got wise to the fact
that it helps me in my work.

374
00:24:57,569 --> 00:25:00,569
 So, as long as l work,
you'll have to pardon my Southern accent.

375
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:10,088
 Well, shut my mouth,
who's that gorgeous-looking creature?

376
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:12,328
 Have you heard that gag
that's been flying around town?

377
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:15,329
''Who was that lady l saw you with?''

378
00:25:28,089 --> 00:25:30,688
You mean, that's no lady, that's your wife?

379
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:33,689
 l like this place best
of all the spots l've been to.

380
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:37,009
 -You do?
-Maybe it's because l'm so happy.

381
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:40,609
-Just think of it, Lucy. You'll be my wife.
 -Yes, l am thinking of it.

382
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:44,168
 l've hoped for it
ever since that first night l met you.

383
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:46,328
l can hardly wait for your final decree
 to come along.

384
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:49,329
lt'll come along, Dan.

385
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:55,928
 lncidentally,
here's my husband coming along.

386
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,448
-Hello, folks.
 -Hello.

387
00:25:57,449 --> 00:26:00,449
This is Dixie Belle Lee.

388
00:26:01,969 --> 00:26:04,969
 This is Mrs. Warriner, and Mr. Leeson,
the gentleman Mrs. Warriner will marry.

389
00:26:06,329 --> 00:26:09,128
-lt's mighty fine meeting you.
 -Now come along.

390
00:26:09,129 --> 00:26:12,088
Now, you're sure we're not intruding?

391
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:15,089
 -What do you mean?
-Wouldn't you like us to have a drink?

392
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:23,129
-Yes, of course.
 -Sit down.

393
00:26:32,449 --> 00:26:35,449
My, isn't this cosy?

394
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:38,609
So, you two are going to be married.

395
00:26:41,449 --> 00:26:44,449
l was glad to hear that. l said to myself,
 ''That Leeson's just the man for Lucy.''

396
00:26:44,689 --> 00:26:47,448
 -Then l said to myself--
-He's always talking to himself.

397
00:26:47,449 --> 00:26:50,208
-lsn't this a charming place?
 -Do you really like it?

398
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:53,209
 l'm so glad.
l almost feel like the place is mine.

399
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:55,048
 -You come here often?
-l work here, didn't you know that?

400
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:57,248
No.

401
00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:00,249
You're from the South, aren't you?

402
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:04,169
Well, now isn't he just the cleverest gent?
 How'd y'all ever guess that?

403
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:07,128
l don't know, it was just a shot in the dark.

404
00:27:07,129 --> 00:27:09,688
But Dixie Belle Lee isn't her real name.

405
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:12,689
 -No?
-No, she changed it, you see...

406
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:16,369
 because her family objected
to her going into show business.

407
00:27:17,689 --> 00:27:20,689
My folks thought l was going to the dogs
 when l decided to go to work.

408
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:23,849
 l'm sure you'll be a big success,
and then they'll be proud of you.

409
00:27:24,729 --> 00:27:27,328
Thank you. lt's real nice of you to say that.
 l'd better go now and get ready.

410
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:30,329
-Can you stay and see my act?
 -We'll stay.

411
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:36,328
-Nothing could drag us away.
 -See you later, then.

412
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:39,329
-She seems like a nice girl.
 -lndeed.

413
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:44,129
Enough about Dixie Belle for the moment.
 Let's talk about yourselves.

414
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:47,369
So you're going to live in Oklahoma, Lucy?
 How l envy you.

415
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:52,009
 Ever since l was a small boy
that name has been filled with magic for me.

416
00:27:52,209 --> 00:27:54,928
Oklahoma.

417
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:57,929
We're going to live right in Oklahoma City.

418
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:00,928
Not Oklahoma City itself?

419
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,648
Lucy! you lucky girl.

420
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:06,649
No more running around the nightspots.

421
00:28:06,729 --> 00:28:09,729
No more prowling around
 in New York shops.

422
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:11,688
l'll think of you whenever a show opens
 and say to myself:

423
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:14,689
''She's well out of it.''

424
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:18,329
 New York's all right for a visit,
but l wouldn't want to live here.

425
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:21,489
l know l'll enjoy Oklahoma City.

426
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:27,209
 Of course. lf it gets dull,
you can always go to Tulsa for the weekend.

427
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:30,248
 l think a big change
like that does one good.

428
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:33,249
That's right.

429
00:28:34,689 --> 00:28:35,768
 l know this isn't quite the place,
but Lucy tells me you two own a coal mine.

430
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:38,769
What about it?

431
00:28:40,489 --> 00:28:42,568
Yes. Mr. Leeson thought that maybe
 he'd like to buy your interest.

432
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:45,569
That is, if the price is right.

433
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:49,529
l was telling Mr. Leeson, l mean Daniel...

434
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:54,409
 about how badly we were doing,
and he thought maybe he could do better.

435
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:58,529
 l suppose you told him
there wasn't any coal in it, too.

436
00:28:59,689 --> 00:29:01,728
 Well, if you're interested,
you might bring around the data tomorrow.

437
00:29:01,729 --> 00:29:04,729
l'm very lucky.

438
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:08,529
You know what they call me back home?

439
00:30:34,489 --> 00:30:37,489
l can guess.

440
00:30:52,689 --> 00:30:55,248
l just met her.

441
00:30:55,249 --> 00:30:58,249
l guess it was easier for her
 to change her name...

442
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:02,008
than for a whole family to change theirs.

443
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:05,009
That'd go great out West.

444
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:07,848
Seemed to go pretty well
 with the cowboy here.

445
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:10,849
You want to change the subject?

446
00:31:11,449 --> 00:31:14,048
Why don't you two get up and dance?
 Or don't you dance?

447
00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:17,049
Lucy doesn't care much about dancing.

448
00:31:18,889 --> 00:31:21,889
Didn't you know that?

449
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:25,889
Did Lucy tell you that? She's holding out
 on you. She's a beautiful dancer.

450
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:28,648
Why, l used to call her ''Twinkle Toes.''
 Hello, Twinkle Toes.

451
00:31:28,649 --> 00:31:31,648
Have you been fooling me, you little rascal?

452
00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:34,649
 Honestly, l didn't think
you cared much about it.

453
00:31:34,889 --> 00:31:37,408
 Care about it?
Why, l could dance till the cows come home.

454
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:40,409
l won several cups at it myself.

455
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:43,328
We never won any cups.

456
00:31:43,329 --> 00:31:46,329
Maybe you had the wrong partner.

457
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,489
There's a lot in what you say.

458
00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:15,848
-Can l have this waltz, Lucy?
 -Of course.

459
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:18,849
Here, give this to the orchestra leader
 and tell him...

460
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:18,409
-to play the same number again.
 -Yes, sir.

461
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:23,568
Come on, sing.

462
00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:26,569
lt's ''all day.''

463
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:01,768
 -l'm sorry.
-lt's all right.

464
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:03,928
-Not bad.
-Thanks.

465
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:06,328
-Never had a lesson in my life.
 -You don't say.

466
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:09,329
-Have you?
 -Well, yes.

467
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:15,009
Let's sing another one.
That must be him now.

468
00:35:15,169 --> 00:35:17,728
-Hello, Warriner.
 -Hello, Leeson.

469
00:35:17,729 --> 00:35:20,729
-Hello, Lucy.
-Hello, Jerry.

470
00:35:21,129 --> 00:35:23,768
-Glad you dropped up.
 -Thanks.

471
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:26,769
l really am very interested
 in that mine of yours.

472
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:30,329
Yes, l brought along all the records
 and history of....

473
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:33,688
l've looked all over for McCall's report
 on that mine.

474
00:35:33,689 --> 00:35:36,689
-l can't find it anywhere. You must have it.
 -Maybe l have.

475
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:40,409
 Next chance you get,
look through your stocking drawer.

476
00:35:40,649 --> 00:35:42,888
She always hides important things
 in the top drawer of her dresser.

477
00:35:42,889 --> 00:35:45,889
She does?

478
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:48,768
Every legal paper we had smelled of sachet.

479
00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:51,769
lt did?

480
00:35:52,209 --> 00:35:55,209
Even the marriage certificate.

481
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:58,769
Remember when the clerk asked to see it
 and you couldn't find it?

482
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:03,329
We had a bunch of pals at the hotel.
 They kept ribbing us all night.

483
00:36:06,649 --> 00:36:09,649
Remember when they sent the bellboy?
 We didn't want ice water.

484
00:36:12,289 --> 00:36:15,088
No?

485
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:18,089
What's the matter?

486
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,488
 When you two are married
the three of us can talk more freely.

487
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:23,489
About this mine business...

488
00:36:29,929 --> 00:36:32,929
 this place was formerly owned
by the Fullerton Brothers. They....

489
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:34,488
You've heard of the Fullerton Brothers,
 haven't you?

490
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:37,489
Yes.

491
00:36:38,049 --> 00:36:41,049
 lt seems they didn't know much
about the mining situation in Pennsylvania.

492
00:36:42,249 --> 00:36:44,128
-Their racket was mainly--
 -Why, hello, Ma!

493
00:36:44,129 --> 00:36:46,968
 -Hello.
-Hello, Mrs. Leeson.

494
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:49,208
 -Hello, Lucy.
-Ma, this is Mr. Jerry Warriner.

495
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:52,209
 -Not--
-Yes, ma'am, that's right.

496
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:56,129
-We're discussing a business proposition.
 -l see.

497
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:58,008
-lt's funny seeing you.
 -lt is?

498
00:36:58,009 --> 00:37:01,009
Well, it's funny seeing you.

499
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:04,769
What l mean is, l was at a tea this afternoon
 where some people...

500
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:07,809
were speaking of you and of Lucy, too.

501
00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:13,089
They knew you both before the divorce.

502
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:16,889
l'll bet you run into dozens of people
 who knew us before the divorce.

503
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:20,849
Yes, we used to get around quite a lot.
 Didn't we?

504
00:37:21,969 --> 00:37:24,168
 They spoke very well of you.
They said you were a real gentleman.

505
00:37:24,169 --> 00:37:27,128
Oh, did they really?

506
00:37:27,129 --> 00:37:29,728
And they were talking of Lucy, too.

507
00:37:29,729 --> 00:37:32,729
You know, you do sing divinely, dear.

508
00:37:33,249 --> 00:37:36,249
But l'd never realised till this afternoon
 that you had a teacher...

509
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:40,489
and a very handsome one, l understand.

510
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:45,129
There was a woman there, if l hadn't been
 a lady l would have slapped her face.

511
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:48,529
 -Why didn't you?
-l wish l had, because she insinuated....

512
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:52,289
 As a matter of fact,
she didn't even insinuate.

513
00:37:55,449 --> 00:37:58,449
 Well, she was talking
about your divorcing Mr. Warriner.

514
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:05,329
She came right out and said
 that it should have been....

515
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:09,208
No matter, no matter.

516
00:38:09,209 --> 00:38:12,048
-No matter.
-No matter.

517
00:38:12,049 --> 00:38:15,049
Let's get down to business, Leeson.

518
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:18,609
lf l'd had time to work this mine myself,
 l'd have made a fortune.

519
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:21,769
 But l was always too busy
making money for other people.

520
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,969
 There's a section up there
simply crying for someone to go in...

521
00:38:25,129 --> 00:38:28,129
who has the time and money to give it.

522
00:38:28,969 --> 00:38:30,768
 l think if you could sink a shaft
in this north corner, right about here....

523
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:33,769
Wait, let me show you something.

524
00:38:34,009 --> 00:38:36,888
 l ought to tell you, Jerry,
nobody is listening to you.

525
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:39,728
The girl's name needs clearing, partner.

526
00:38:39,729 --> 00:38:42,729
l wouldn't go so far as to say that.

527
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:45,528
 But l'm sure Mr. Warriner
is pleased at the opportunity...

528
00:38:45,529 --> 00:38:48,529
to deny that silly story
l heard this afternoon.

529
00:38:49,249 --> 00:38:52,249
Why, certainly, Mrs. Leeson. What is it?

530
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:58,209
This woman said Mr. Warriner permitted you
 to bring proceedings so that....

531
00:38:58,489 --> 00:39:01,448
Well, so that your reputation
 wouldn't be ruined.

532
00:39:01,449 --> 00:39:03,608
There, it's out. l know it's silly but--

533
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:05,448
Of course it's silly, and so are you.

534
00:39:05,449 --> 00:39:08,449
 -What?
-See here, Warriner.

535
00:39:09,169 --> 00:39:12,169
l mean it's silly for your mother
 to believe such nonsense.

536
00:39:14,649 --> 00:39:17,649
 You see, our divorce was one of those
tragedies that you read about in the papers.

537
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:21,489
A trusting woman and a worthless man.

538
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:25,328
l was never good enough for Lucy
 and finally she found it out.

539
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:28,329
Lucy is above suspicion,
 and always has been.

540
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:34,409
She's as pure as the driven snow,
 as faithful as she is fair.

541
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:37,929
And l would that l had been worthy
 to kiss the hem of her garment.

542
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,409
 Never during our marital bliss
did she cause me a moment's uneasiness.

543
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:45,168
 Never did l have to ask, ''Lucy, where
have you been, what were you doing?''

544
00:39:45,169 --> 00:39:48,169
l always knew.

545
00:39:48,769 --> 00:39:51,368
 l tell you, something wonderful
went out of my life when l lost her.

546
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:54,369
-l know just how you feel.
 -How do you know?

547
00:40:02,249 --> 00:40:04,448
 How can you know how it feels to have
used up the best years of a woman's life?

548
00:40:04,449 --> 00:40:07,449
Of course, that's the way it goes.

549
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:12,329
Excuse me, you're sitting on my prospectus.

550
00:40:13,729 --> 00:40:16,128
Dan, take those and look them over.

551
00:40:16,129 --> 00:40:18,968
And let me know. And, Dan...

552
00:40:18,969 --> 00:40:21,969
take good care of her.

553
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:26,889
l'll be going now.

554
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:41,929
lf you ever think of me, send me a postcard.

555
00:40:48,169 --> 00:40:51,169
Just say, ''Having a wonderful time.''
 l'll understand.

556
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:57,889
Goodbye, now.

557
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:01,369
Ma, are you convinced about everything?

558
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:04,769
What about the music teacher?

559
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:08,328
You two try and settle things for yourselves.
 Let me know how it comes out.

560
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:11,329
Put a light in the window if it's yes,
 two if it's no.

561
00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:33,688
And if you can't make up your minds,
 just pull down the shade.

562
00:41:33,689 --> 00:41:36,689
Hello.

563
00:41:36,729 --> 00:41:39,729
What are you doing in my apartment,
 if l'm not too inquisitive?

564
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:42,769
l thought after my swell reference
 about you, l deserved a drink.

565
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:47,569
-Wish l'd mixed it for you.
 -l see what you mean.

566
00:41:47,929 --> 00:41:50,888
 Certainly do appreciate
all the charming things you said about me.

567
00:41:50,889 --> 00:41:53,448
 When l get the chance,
l hope l can do as much for you.

568
00:41:53,449 --> 00:41:56,449
 lt was nothing at all.
l try to go through life--

569
00:41:57,289 --> 00:42:00,289
 l know,
spreading a little sunshine as you go.

570
00:42:01,209 --> 00:42:04,208
No, frankly, l was worried about you.

571
00:42:04,209 --> 00:42:07,209
You've never asked for money.
 Do you need any?

572
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:09,608
No, l think l can struggle along
 without any help from you.

573
00:42:09,609 --> 00:42:12,609
l thought maybe you made
 a bad investment.

574
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:16,369
-No. l only made one bad investment.
 -Don't bite me.

575
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:19,368
l thought that maybe Buffalo Bill's millions
 might have something to do--

576
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:22,208
Nothing to do with anything.

577
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:25,208
 Millions or no millions,
he's a very charming person.

578
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,768
l've seen him.

579
00:42:27,769 --> 00:42:29,888
l can't possibly interpret this as jealousy.

580
00:42:29,889 --> 00:42:32,889
No.

581
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:35,928
l've come out from behind those clouds.

582
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:38,929
l've taken a definite turn for the better.

583
00:42:41,369 --> 00:42:43,528
Nothing's going to hurt me anymore.

584
00:42:43,529 --> 00:42:45,888
That's too bad, Jerry.

585
00:42:45,889 --> 00:42:48,889
-Did it hurt you much?
 -No.

586
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:52,609
-Just the one hand?
-Just the one hand.

587
00:42:52,689 --> 00:42:54,728
 l'll be going.
l always like to leave people laughing.

588
00:42:54,729 --> 00:42:57,729
ls there anything l can get you for it?

589
00:42:59,169 --> 00:43:02,169
No, l'm a stout fellow, l'll carry on.

590
00:43:04,129 --> 00:43:06,808
 -Where's Mr. Smith?
-Out with Aunt Patsy.

591
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:09,608
Tell me something before l go, will you?

592
00:43:09,609 --> 00:43:12,609
-What do you see in this fellow?
 -None of your business.

593
00:43:14,249 --> 00:43:17,249
 Not that l care, but what kind of a line
could he have that would impress you?

594
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:21,368
You might be surprised. You could take
 a few lessons and profit nicely.

595
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:23,528
You'd be surprised what l'd give
 to get an earful of that.

596
00:43:23,529 --> 00:43:26,248
 -You would.
-l couldn't wait to see you.

597
00:43:26,249 --> 00:43:29,048
 l had to tell you
how awful l feel about what happened.

598
00:43:29,049 --> 00:43:31,448
 You'll have to forgive Ma.
She's kind of old-fashioned.

599
00:43:31,449 --> 00:43:34,449
 -l'll forgive her.
-You won't hold it against her?

600
00:43:34,689 --> 00:43:36,448
No. Now you go and dress for dinner.
 We'll be very late.

601
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:39,449
l'm a lot quicker than you are.

602
00:43:39,689 --> 00:43:42,689
Just to prove that you're not mad,
 will you give me a little kiss?

603
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:45,608
-Right here in the hall? Don't be silly.
 -There's nobody around.

604
00:43:45,609 --> 00:43:48,248
-You never can tell if someone's around.
 -l'll come in.

605
00:43:48,249 --> 00:43:50,168
Don't come in. We'll be awfully late.

606
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,169
-Don't be bashful.
 -l'm not bashful.

607
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:57,049
 l've never kissed you before.
And l don't think this is exactly the place.

608
00:43:58,049 --> 00:44:00,568
 lf you knew how crazy l am about you,
you wouldn't hesitate. l can't sleep nights.

609
00:44:00,569 --> 00:44:03,408
-Try drinking some hot milk.
 -l must be in love...

610
00:44:03,409 --> 00:44:06,409
-because l started writing poetry to you.
 -Poetry.

611
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:11,329
l was going to surprise you with it at dinner,
 but it's short. lt goes like this:

612
00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:15,809
''To you, my little prairie flower
 l'm thinking of you every hour

613
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:20,889
''Though now you're just a friend to me
 l wonder what the end will be''

614
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:25,529
 Excuse me, Dan,
l do laugh at the oddest times.

615
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:33,128
You see what l mean?

616
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:36,129
''Oh, you would make my life divine

617
00:44:37,289 --> 00:44:38,648
''if you would change your name to mine''

618
00:44:38,649 --> 00:44:41,649
That's really....

619
00:44:42,209 --> 00:44:45,168
 That's beautiful, Dan.
lt's really beautiful. There's my phone.

620
00:44:45,169 --> 00:44:47,688
You've got to go now, really.

621
00:44:47,689 --> 00:44:50,689
 -Hello.
-Comment ca va, madame?

622
00:44:53,129 --> 00:44:56,129
-You haven't forgotten about tomorrow?
 -Look, l have company.

623
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,529
All right, wait a minute, hold the phone.

624
00:45:06,289 --> 00:45:09,289
There, now go on, Dan, l'll see you later.

625
00:45:09,529 --> 00:45:12,529
 Lucy, you've made me
the happiest man in the world.

626
00:45:14,729 --> 00:45:17,008
Dreamed of this moment for days,
 now it's all come true.

627
00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:20,009
Dan, really!

628
00:45:26,129 --> 00:45:29,129
l'll go home now and dress for dinner.
 l'm so happy l could eat three steaks.

629
00:45:36,489 --> 00:45:39,489
Hello?

630
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:42,088
Telephone.

631
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:43,848
Hello?

632
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:46,849
Can l expect you tomorrow?

633
00:45:48,769 --> 00:45:51,769
 At 3:00 tomorrow afternoon?
l think that would be convenient.

634
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:55,889
Very well then, 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.
 Goodbye.

635
00:45:56,569 --> 00:45:59,488
 -Who was that?
-Why should it interest you?

636
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:02,489
 Wait a minute, after all,
the final decree isn't in yet.

637
00:46:03,649 --> 00:46:06,649
-lf you must know, it was my masseuse.
 -My who?

638
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:10,369
 l've heard everything. l'm going out
to get some popcorn and pink lemonade.

639
00:46:25,209 --> 00:46:26,928
l've just seen a three-ring circus.

640
00:46:26,929 --> 00:46:29,728
Armand Duvalle in?

641
00:46:29,729 --> 00:46:31,608
 -Please, your name?
-Jerry Warriner. ls my wife here?

642
00:46:31,609 --> 00:46:33,608
l do not know.

643
00:46:33,609 --> 00:46:36,609
What do you mean you don't know?

644
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:39,969
 -l only know l don't know.
-You wouldn't mind if l look around.

645
00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:47,329
Me, jujitsu.

646
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:53,369
-Me, jujitsu.
-ls that so?

647
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:56,288
Me, jujitsu, too.

648
00:46:56,289 --> 00:46:59,289
 You must not go in.
You must not disturb him.

649
00:48:03,009 --> 00:48:06,009
l can't go in, he must not be disturbed.

650
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:09,289
You should have seen your master
 this afternoon.

651
00:48:11,009 --> 00:48:12,768
Come on, sit up, boy.

652
00:48:12,769 --> 00:48:15,769
No, better still, l tell you...

653
00:48:17,409 --> 00:48:20,409
 go hide your eyes
and l'll give it to you that way.

654
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:25,049
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five.
 No peeking.

655
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:28,609
 Five, ten, fifteen, twenty,
twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five. You ready?

656
00:48:28,969 --> 00:48:31,888
All right, then, come on.

657
00:48:31,889 --> 00:48:34,808
You're too smart.

658
00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:37,809
 Honestly, Patsy,
you should have seen Jerry this afternoon.

659
00:48:38,129 --> 00:48:41,129
 And when that chair
started to slip from under him.

660
00:48:42,209 --> 00:48:45,008
-l will say that for Jerry, he's never dull.
 -He was so silly, though.

661
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:47,168
l know he thought he'd find me
 in Armand's arms.

662
00:48:47,169 --> 00:48:50,169
He must have been terribly disappointed.

663
00:48:50,929 --> 00:48:53,929
 He must have felt awful
about not finding you two in a clinch.

664
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:57,008
Jerry's always had the most fantastic way
 of getting into scrapes.

665
00:48:57,009 --> 00:48:59,688
We've had some grand laughs together.

666
00:48:59,689 --> 00:49:01,088
 But a girl really wants
dependability and security.

667
00:49:01,089 --> 00:49:03,968
Yes, l suppose she does.

668
00:49:03,969 --> 00:49:06,408
Then she ought to buy an annuity.
 Be more fun than Leeson.

669
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:09,409
Don't explain. l'm not marrying him.

670
00:49:10,009 --> 00:49:13,009
That's what l wanted to tell you.
 l'm not either.

671
00:49:13,569 --> 00:49:16,569
l can't marry him because l'm still in love
 with that crazy lunatic.

672
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:20,929
And there's nothing l can do about it.

673
00:49:21,089 --> 00:49:24,048
Patsy, here and there, now and then...

674
00:49:24,049 --> 00:49:27,049
-l've done a few things for you, haven't l?
 -Yes.

675
00:49:28,409 --> 00:49:31,409
 Here's a note that l've written to Dan
explaining exactly why l can't marry him.

676
00:49:32,289 --> 00:49:34,768
l could never phrase anything in person
 as beautifully as l have in this note.

677
00:49:34,769 --> 00:49:37,769
But now l've lost my nerve
 about giving it to him.

678
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:40,809
-Could you sort of see that he gets it?
 -l should say so.

679
00:49:41,169 --> 00:49:42,288
Well, l tried to forget Jerry.

680
00:49:42,289 --> 00:49:45,289
l know.

681
00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:49,289
 That's why you jumped at Leeson
as if he were the last man on earth.

682
00:49:53,609 --> 00:49:56,528
l'll answer that.

683
00:49:56,529 --> 00:49:59,529
Every time l open the door
 somebody walks in.

684
00:50:02,409 --> 00:50:04,568
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

685
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:07,328
 -Hello, Armand.
-You sent for me, madam.

686
00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:10,329
Yes, l've been so embarrassed
 about what happened...

687
00:50:10,409 --> 00:50:13,128
 in front of your guests
l couldn't get out of there soon enough.

688
00:50:13,129 --> 00:50:16,129
Your husband is a very funny man, isn't he?

689
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:19,408
 l'm convinced he must care about me
or he wouldn't do those funny things.

690
00:50:19,409 --> 00:50:22,409
Yes, but he doesn't care much about me.

691
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:26,929
No, Armand, that's just what l'm getting at.

692
00:50:27,569 --> 00:50:30,569
-l'm wondering, could you do me a favour?
 -But of course.

693
00:50:30,769 --> 00:50:32,888
l've been thinking...

694
00:50:32,889 --> 00:50:35,889
l wonder if you could convince him...

695
00:50:36,289 --> 00:50:37,888
that everything was just as l said it was
 that night at the inn.

696
00:50:37,889 --> 00:50:40,728
l'd be glad to.

697
00:50:40,729 --> 00:50:42,888
But does he carry a gun?

698
00:50:42,889 --> 00:50:45,889
You're not afraid of him?

699
00:50:46,329 --> 00:50:47,408
 -Of course not, but--
-Will you do it for me? As soon as possible?

700
00:50:47,409 --> 00:50:50,409
Yes.

701
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:53,889
And, by all means, he mustn't know
 that l had anything to do with it.

702
00:50:57,209 --> 00:51:00,209
 -No.
-As soon as possible.

703
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:03,048
Mr. Smith! How are you?

704
00:51:03,049 --> 00:51:05,328
-But this is much too soon.
 -lsn't it?

705
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:08,008
-Much too soon.
-What can l do?

706
00:51:08,009 --> 00:51:09,488
-You can't keep standing here.
 -l know, but where can l go?

707
00:51:09,489 --> 00:51:12,489
-Look, out here.
 -No.

708
00:51:15,849 --> 00:51:18,168
Look, in the bedroom. Hurry up.

709
00:51:18,169 --> 00:51:20,888
-Hiya, fellow.
-Hello, Jerry.

710
00:51:20,889 --> 00:51:23,889
-Hello, Patsy. How have you been?
 -Fine.

711
00:51:28,649 --> 00:51:31,649
You knew it was me, didn't you?
 Sure you did.

712
00:51:34,089 --> 00:51:37,089
You remembered me, didn't you?
 Sure, you bet.

713
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:40,288
Get away.

714
00:51:40,289 --> 00:51:43,289
-Hello, Jerry.
-Hello, Lucy.

715
00:51:43,449 --> 00:51:46,449
-l suppose you know why l dropped in.
 -No, l don't exactly.

716
00:51:47,849 --> 00:51:50,688
 As a matter of fact, l came to apologise for
my behaviour today in Duvalle's apartment...

717
00:51:50,689 --> 00:51:53,368
-studio, or whatever he calls his joint.
 -Oh, that?

718
00:51:53,369 --> 00:51:56,088
l certainly acted like a prize lunatic,
 and l'm sorry.

719
00:51:56,089 --> 00:51:59,089
-lt was nothing at all.
 -Nothing?

720
00:51:59,329 --> 00:52:01,328
Nothing except the most ridiculous
 and sickening exhibition...

721
00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:03,208
mortal man ever made of himself.

722
00:52:03,209 --> 00:52:06,048
l don't know why l act like that.

723
00:52:06,049 --> 00:52:08,888
Unless it's because of the effect
 that Duvalle has on me.

724
00:52:08,889 --> 00:52:11,889
 l never knew anyone
that can aggravate me the way he does.

725
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:15,609
-l can't think about him without seeing red.
 -You shouldn't get so excited.

726
00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:18,969
 A mere mention of his name
and l feel positively murderous.

727
00:52:19,489 --> 00:52:21,648
You do?

728
00:52:21,649 --> 00:52:24,649
-What's the matter with you?
 -Nothing.

729
00:52:25,089 --> 00:52:28,088
l was just thinking about your problem.
 You certainly have a problem.

730
00:52:28,089 --> 00:52:31,089
 l know l have a problem,
and l know how l feel, too.

731
00:52:34,809 --> 00:52:37,328
l guess there's nothing l can do about it.

732
00:52:37,329 --> 00:52:40,329
Look at Mr. Smith.

733
00:52:41,369 --> 00:52:44,369
-l guess he wants to play.
 -Yes.

734
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:48,329
Here, you go and hide it for him.

735
00:53:01,129 --> 00:53:03,328
No fair peeking, Smitty.

736
00:53:03,329 --> 00:53:05,448
All right, let's go. Come on.

737
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:07,288
Oh, no, you're cold.

738
00:53:07,289 --> 00:53:10,289
You're colder than ice. Cold, cold.

739
00:53:13,729 --> 00:53:16,729
Oh, boy, what's wrong with you?

740
00:53:18,289 --> 00:53:21,289
Nice going, fellow. Let it go. Good boy.

741
00:53:22,929 --> 00:53:25,929
Well, Lucy...

742
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:31,289
the main idea is, do you accept my apology?

743
00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:33,888
 Besides making a blue-ribbon sap of myself
today, l must have embarrassed you terribly.

744
00:53:33,889 --> 00:53:36,808
You took it fine, though.

745
00:53:36,809 --> 00:53:39,809
-You must admit you were--
 -Yes.

746
00:53:42,209 --> 00:53:45,209
 -What was that?
-Nothing, just an old mirror.

747
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:48,008
-The boy's getting worse every day.
 -Mr. Smith, that's a fine thing.

748
00:53:48,009 --> 00:53:51,009
 l'm surprised at you.
Trying to get rid of me?

749
00:53:51,449 --> 00:53:54,449
No, he wasn't trying to get rid of you,
 you know it.

750
00:53:54,529 --> 00:53:57,529
Well, l really hadn't planned
 to leave so soon.

751
00:53:58,529 --> 00:54:01,529
 l thought, if you have nothing to do,
you might like to go for a drive with me.

752
00:54:02,049 --> 00:54:05,049
Well, the air will do you good,
 and we can talk things over?

753
00:54:05,129 --> 00:54:07,568
-l'd love that. Yes, it would do me good.
 -Swell.

754
00:54:07,569 --> 00:54:10,569
 -Where's your car?
-Downstairs, in the garage.

755
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:15,049
 While l'm changing,
you get the car and l'll meet you out front.

756
00:54:33,449 --> 00:54:36,449
 -Okay, dear.
-l won't be a minute.

757
00:54:36,809 --> 00:54:39,408
That's funny, l only bought the hat
 an hour ago and look at it.

758
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,288
Did you have a haircut, maybe?

759
00:54:41,289 --> 00:54:44,289
-No.
-No?

760
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:47,489
Maybe you have it on backwards.
 Put it on the other way around.

761
00:54:50,649 --> 00:54:53,649
Well, l hadn't thought of that. Wait a minute.

762
00:54:59,369 --> 00:55:02,369
Yes, there, now that's more becoming.

763
00:55:02,569 --> 00:55:04,848
lt is a bit roomy. Maybe they're wearing
 them that way this year.

764
00:55:04,849 --> 00:55:06,288
Well, l'm not.

765
00:55:06,289 --> 00:55:09,168
Looks mighty funny to me.

766
00:55:09,169 --> 00:55:10,808
Look at your ears. That's why.
 Your ears are all down.

767
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:13,248
What's wrong with it?

768
00:55:13,249 --> 00:55:15,648
-Stick your ears up underneath.
 -Don't be silly.

769
00:55:15,649 --> 00:55:18,649
Well, l always put my ears in.

770
00:55:24,289 --> 00:55:27,289
Well, l always put my ears in.

771
00:55:28,729 --> 00:55:31,729
 -Who's there?
-Me, and my ma.

772
00:55:31,809 --> 00:55:34,809
Lucy, l've caused you enough trouble
 for one day.

773
00:55:34,849 --> 00:55:37,688
He better not find me here.
l'll duck in the other room.

774
00:55:37,689 --> 00:55:40,689
No, no, but....

775
00:55:45,769 --> 00:55:47,608
Could you....

776
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:49,328
 -Hello, there.
-Hello, Aunt Patsy.

777
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:50,808
Good evening, Mrs. Leeson.

778
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:53,809
Good evening, Mrs. Leeson.

779
00:55:54,209 --> 00:55:57,209
Lucy, you didn't come over this morning
 the way you usually do.

780
00:55:57,889 --> 00:56:00,889
 -l was so busy this morning.
-That's what l kept telling you, Ma.

781
00:56:06,769 --> 00:56:09,769
-Do you mind if l sit down?
 -No, not at all.

782
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:13,329
-l've got an awful headache.
 -Well, l'm getting one.

783
00:56:14,849 --> 00:56:17,208
 l thought maybe you were angry
at my repeating what that awful....

784
00:56:17,209 --> 00:56:20,209
Nonsense, Mrs. Leeson.

785
00:56:23,569 --> 00:56:25,768
 -What on earth was that?
-Somebody's cleaning up in there.

786
00:56:25,769 --> 00:56:28,769
l was afraid....

787
00:56:29,729 --> 00:56:32,729
-Must they do that?
 -Yes--

788
00:56:33,489 --> 00:56:35,808
l was afraid, but l knew that in your heart
 you knew...

789
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,488
that l never suspected you.

790
00:56:37,489 --> 00:56:40,489
Of course not, Mrs. Leeson.

791
00:56:43,009 --> 00:56:46,008
The first time Dan talked about you, l said,
''Why, she sounds like a sweet little thing.''

792
00:56:46,009 --> 00:56:49,009
Why, to know Lucy is to love her.

793
00:56:49,169 --> 00:56:52,169
Lucy, l got a surprise for you.
 Ma and l talked it all over.

794
00:56:53,969 --> 00:56:56,969
l hope you are going to like Oklahoma,
 because l'm going to ask you....

795
00:56:58,169 --> 00:57:01,169
Excuse me.

796
00:57:06,929 --> 00:57:09,288
They forgot to touch second.

797
00:57:09,289 --> 00:57:12,289
Come on, Dan.

798
00:57:16,649 --> 00:57:19,649
Well, l guess a man's best friend
 is his mother.

799
00:57:19,889 --> 00:57:22,889
l certainly learned about women from you.

800
00:57:30,209 --> 00:57:33,209
-Here's your diploma.
 -Come on.

801
00:57:35,169 --> 00:57:38,169
What's the matter with you, Smitty?

802
00:57:39,609 --> 00:57:41,848
l see what you mean. Patsy, look at this.

803
00:57:41,849 --> 00:57:44,849
Oh, yes, that's Barbara Vance.

804
00:57:45,169 --> 00:57:48,169
-You know who she is, don't you?
 -Yes, l know who she is.

805
00:57:48,249 --> 00:57:51,249
 The madcap heiress. lsn't that
what the papers usually call her?

806
00:57:52,609 --> 00:57:55,368
 Millions of dollars and no sense.
l wonder what she's doing with Jerry.

807
00:57:55,369 --> 00:57:58,048
 Entertaining him,
running around town with him...

808
00:57:58,049 --> 00:58:00,728
and l imagine falling in love with him.
 That's all.

809
00:58:00,729 --> 00:58:03,729
-You can't tell all that from this picture.
 -No.

810
00:58:05,729 --> 00:58:08,729
 But l can tell it from what l've heard.
lf rumour is true, Barbara is quite a girl.

811
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:18,168
And Jerry's having a lot of fun.

812
00:59:18,169 --> 00:59:20,448
Come in.

813
00:59:20,449 --> 00:59:23,168
Hello, Jerry.

814
00:59:23,169 --> 00:59:25,368
Hello, Lucy, what's the nature of this visit?

815
00:59:25,369 --> 00:59:27,408
Well, l just thought l'd....

816
00:59:27,409 --> 00:59:30,409
-Do you know what today is?
 -Certainly.

817
00:59:31,169 --> 00:59:33,968
 Our divorce becomes final today.
Tomorrow, we'll both be back in circulation.

818
00:59:33,969 --> 00:59:36,969
 l just thought l'd drop up
and wish you a lot of luck.

819
00:59:37,409 --> 00:59:40,409
 That's very nice of you.
Would you like to join me for some wine?

820
00:59:40,809 --> 00:59:43,809
Of course l would.

821
00:59:46,569 --> 00:59:49,569
That was a cute picture of you and Barbara
 in the morning paper.

822
00:59:49,809 --> 00:59:52,809
l love the caption: ''Off with the old love.''

823
00:59:57,929 --> 01:00:00,048
Well, l think that Barbara and l
 will be very happy together.

824
01:00:00,049 --> 01:00:03,049
l'm sure you'll be very happy.

825
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:07,328
 Only l don't think
you'll be as happy as Daniel and l.

826
01:00:07,329 --> 01:00:10,329
What?

827
01:00:11,609 --> 01:00:13,768
 -ls that still on?
-What do you mean, ''ls that still on?''

828
01:00:13,769 --> 01:00:16,769
After that two-men-in-a-bedroom farce...

829
01:00:16,809 --> 01:00:19,809
l sort of imagined that when we left, he left.

830
01:00:20,369 --> 01:00:21,488
Oh, no. l just explained things to him
 very simply.

831
01:00:21,489 --> 01:00:23,448
Oh, did you?

832
01:00:23,449 --> 01:00:26,448
Did you say our cars broke down...

833
01:00:26,449 --> 01:00:29,008
and we had to stay at your place
 because of the taxi strike?

834
01:00:29,009 --> 01:00:31,368
No, l didn't tell him that. l told him the truth.

835
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:32,968
And, strangely enough, he believed me.

836
01:00:32,969 --> 01:00:35,208
Yes, it was very refreshing.

837
01:00:35,209 --> 01:00:38,209
Well, what shall we drink to?

838
01:00:39,209 --> 01:00:42,209
Let's drink to our future.

839
01:00:42,329 --> 01:00:44,688
Here's hoping you and Barbara
 will be very happy...

840
01:00:44,689 --> 01:00:47,208
which l doubt very much.

841
01:00:47,209 --> 01:00:50,209
Let's drink to your happiness
 with Buffalo Bill...

842
01:00:50,969 --> 01:00:53,969
 -Good.
-...which doesn't even make sense.

843
01:00:54,169 --> 01:00:56,768
-l'll tell you. We'll drink to the two of us.
 -Good.

844
01:00:56,769 --> 01:00:59,208
As we go down life's highway...

845
01:00:59,209 --> 01:01:02,209
you going your way...

846
01:01:02,489 --> 01:01:05,489
and l going my way.

847
01:01:07,769 --> 01:01:09,728
 -Okay?
-All right.

848
01:01:09,729 --> 01:01:12,729
lt's flat.

849
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:18,129
l'll open another bottle.

850
01:01:22,089 --> 01:01:25,089
You'll have to hurry it up though
 because l'm meeting Daniel.

851
01:01:26,529 --> 01:01:29,208
l think champagne is so fitting
 to round out our romance.

852
01:01:29,209 --> 01:01:31,688
l remember the first drink
 we ever had together.

853
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:33,928
You, in your very best manner, said:

854
01:01:33,929 --> 01:01:36,208
''lt must be champagne.''

855
01:01:36,209 --> 01:01:39,209
And then you offered a toast,
 you remember?

856
01:01:39,769 --> 01:01:42,648
 -No, l don't.
-Well, being a woman, l do.

857
01:01:42,649 --> 01:01:45,048
You said....

858
01:01:45,049 --> 01:01:47,768
This'll land you a laugh.

859
01:01:47,769 --> 01:01:50,769
You said:

860
01:01:51,169 --> 01:01:54,169
''Lend an ear, l implore you

861
01:01:56,569 --> 01:01:59,569
''This comes from my heart
 l'll always adore you

862
01:02:02,649 --> 01:02:05,649
''Till death do us part''

863
01:02:10,009 --> 01:02:12,688
Remember?

864
01:02:12,689 --> 01:02:15,689
lt was pretty swell.

865
01:02:17,329 --> 01:02:20,329
l mean, while it lasted.

866
01:02:20,809 --> 01:02:23,809
All beautiful things must end...

867
01:02:27,449 --> 01:02:30,449
so l guess we may as well call it a day.

868
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:39,169
lf you don't mind, l'll call a car.

869
01:02:44,009 --> 01:02:45,888
Would you call a car for me?
 Right away, please.

870
01:02:45,889 --> 01:02:48,448
Hello?

871
01:02:48,449 --> 01:02:51,449
Who's this, may l ask?

872
01:02:53,729 --> 01:02:56,729
lt's what's-her-name. l only said hello.
 Maybe you can pick it up from there.

873
01:02:57,529 --> 01:02:59,808
 -Did you have to answer my phone?
-l thought it was about the car. l'm sorry.

874
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:02,809
What am l going to tell her?

875
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:06,489
You can think of something.
 You always could.

876
01:03:07,969 --> 01:03:10,969
-l haven't time to think of anything.
 -Tell her you'll call her back.

877
01:03:13,209 --> 01:03:15,808
-How can l tell her l'll call her back?
 -Then tell her to call you back.

878
01:03:15,809 --> 01:03:18,809
Hello? Hello, darling.

879
01:03:19,449 --> 01:03:22,368
 Well, it took you long enough.
Have you decided who the woman is?

880
01:03:22,369 --> 01:03:25,369
 lsn't that funny,
l knew you were going to ask me that.

881
01:03:26,089 --> 01:03:28,088
-So did l.
 -Quiet.

882
01:03:28,089 --> 01:03:31,089
lt's very simple, dear. lt's my sister.

883
01:03:31,209 --> 01:03:33,968
 Your sister?
How are you going to get out of that?

884
01:03:33,969 --> 01:03:36,128
She just got back from Paris,
 dropped in to see me.

885
01:03:36,129 --> 01:03:39,129
Jerry, you're slipping.

886
01:03:41,009 --> 01:03:43,928
 l'd love to meet your sister.
Why don't you bring her along tonight?

887
01:03:43,929 --> 01:03:45,888
 She can't come this evening.
She has a previous engagement.

888
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:48,368
She wants me to come over?

889
01:03:48,369 --> 01:03:51,369
Naturally she's anxious
to meet you, too, but....

890
01:03:52,689 --> 01:03:55,608
Yes, tell her l'd love to meet her.
 Tell her to wear boxing gloves.

891
01:03:55,609 --> 01:03:58,008
She said she'll break her engagement
 and come over later.

892
01:03:58,009 --> 01:04:01,009
-But l strongly doubt that....
 -Yes, l doubt it.

893
01:04:01,649 --> 01:04:04,649
 Dear, l'll do my best to fix it up
so the two of you meet very soon.

894
01:04:05,249 --> 01:04:07,768
 -Yes. Goodbye.
-That'd be lovely.

895
01:04:07,769 --> 01:04:10,769
 l'm in a fine fix.
She wants to meet my sister.

896
01:04:11,609 --> 01:04:14,168
 -You're a big help.
-You know me. Anything l can do....

897
01:04:14,169 --> 01:04:17,169
-What? To break it up?
 -l see what you mean.

898
01:04:17,609 --> 01:04:20,609
l'm in a fine mess.

899
01:04:20,769 --> 01:04:23,008
Yes, hello? l did it again.

900
01:04:23,009 --> 01:04:25,728
What does she do? Call every five minutes?

901
01:04:25,729 --> 01:04:27,128
-You shouldn't take that from anybody.
 -Hello, Barbara.

902
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:30,129
Put your foot down....

903
01:04:31,049 --> 01:04:34,049
-l told you she couldn't make it this evening.
 -She can't get away with it.

904
01:04:34,289 --> 01:04:37,289
 There's no reason to call me
every five minutes about it, is there?

905
01:04:45,369 --> 01:04:48,369
No. Well, all right.

906
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:59,568
-Good evening, Mr. Warriner.
 -Good evening.

907
01:04:59,569 --> 01:05:01,208
-Hello, Barbara.
 -Hello.

908
01:05:01,209 --> 01:05:03,088
Good evening, Mrs. Vance.

909
01:05:03,089 --> 01:05:05,768
-Hello, Mr. Vance.
 -Jerry.

910
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:08,568
Where's your sister?

911
01:05:08,569 --> 01:05:11,569
 She was terribly sorry
she couldn't be here tonight.

912
01:05:12,569 --> 01:05:15,568
 She didn't weather the boat trip well.
When l left, she was calling the doctor.

913
01:05:15,569 --> 01:05:17,848
 You can imagine my surprise
when a woman answered the phone.

914
01:05:17,849 --> 01:05:20,849
You can't blame me for being suspicious.

915
01:05:21,809 --> 01:05:23,568
Barbara, you can't have a happy married life
 if you're always suspicious.

916
01:05:23,569 --> 01:05:26,569
There can't be doubts in marriage.

917
01:05:26,969 --> 01:05:28,968
 Marriage is based on faith.
lf you lose that, you've lost everything.

918
01:05:28,969 --> 01:05:31,969
Very well said, Jerry.

919
01:05:33,089 --> 01:05:36,089
 Yes, wasn't it?
l think l read it in a book or something.

920
01:05:37,329 --> 01:05:40,329
 l was just thinking,
will your sister be here for the wedding?

921
01:05:42,769 --> 01:05:45,648
 -l doubt that very much, Mrs. Vance.
-Maybe l should ask her to be a bridesmaid.

922
01:05:45,649 --> 01:05:48,008
l think she's sailing back to Paris
 almost immediately.

923
01:05:48,009 --> 01:05:49,968
 She said she'll try
to see you before she goes.

924
01:05:49,969 --> 01:05:52,008
You'd like my sister. She's your type.

925
01:05:52,009 --> 01:05:55,009
-Where did she go to school?
 -Excuse me?

926
01:05:56,169 --> 01:05:59,169
-l said, where did she go to school?
 -ln Switzerland.

927
01:06:00,929 --> 01:06:03,768
-You say your father was a Princeton man?
 -That's right, sir. Class of '92.

928
01:06:03,769 --> 01:06:06,248
 He tells some funny stories
about the place in those days.

929
01:06:06,249 --> 01:06:08,728
He tells one in particular
 about a football game.

930
01:06:08,729 --> 01:06:11,729
lt seems Yale was playing
 Princeton one day...

931
01:06:12,609 --> 01:06:15,609
 and with the ball
on Princeton's two yard line, Yale fumbled.

932
01:06:16,809 --> 01:06:19,809
A minute to go, Dad picked up the ball,
 and ran....

933
01:06:32,609 --> 01:06:35,609
Miss Lola Warriner.

934
01:06:37,449 --> 01:06:40,368
Hello, brother dear. l made it.

935
01:06:40,369 --> 01:06:43,369
What did you say, dear?

936
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:49,088
-l just asked how you were feeling.
 -l'm feeling fine. And you?

937
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:50,448
Mrs. Vance, may l present my sister, Lola.

938
01:06:50,449 --> 01:06:53,449
How do you do?

939
01:06:53,489 --> 01:06:56,489
-lt's lovely to know you.
 -Thank you.

940
01:07:01,929 --> 01:07:04,728
-Won't you come in?
 -Thank you.

941
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:06,608
-Barbara, this is Lola.
 -How do you do?

942
01:07:06,609 --> 01:07:09,168
lt's nice to be able to meet you.

943
01:07:09,169 --> 01:07:11,688
 l've seen your pictures,
and wondered how you look.

944
01:07:11,689 --> 01:07:13,928
-l wondered about you, too.
 -Well, thank you.

945
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:16,168
 -Lola?
-Yes, dear?

946
01:07:16,169 --> 01:07:19,169
This is Barbara's father, Mr. Vance.

947
01:07:19,529 --> 01:07:21,248
-Mr. Vance, my sister.
 -How do you do?

948
01:07:21,249 --> 01:07:24,249
What's the matter?

949
01:07:24,929 --> 01:07:27,929
Nothing, only l never would have known you
 from his description.

950
01:07:35,689 --> 01:07:38,689
-Won't you sit down?
 -Thank you.

951
01:07:40,169 --> 01:07:42,528
 Did l interrupt something?
Weren't you talking when l came in for....

952
01:07:42,529 --> 01:07:45,408
Would you excuse me, Mrs. Vance?
 My handkerchief.

953
01:07:45,409 --> 01:07:48,409
Thank you.

954
01:07:51,849 --> 01:07:53,608
lt's me. lsn't that silly?

955
01:07:53,609 --> 01:07:56,609
lt's you this time, Mrs. Vance.

956
01:07:59,049 --> 01:08:00,128
Look, l'll just put it over here,
 and get it out of the way.

957
01:08:00,129 --> 01:08:02,808
Dear!

958
01:08:02,809 --> 01:08:05,809
l guess that could go on and on and on.

959
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:08,728
l hope not.

960
01:08:08,729 --> 01:08:11,729
Go on with your story, honey.

961
01:08:11,849 --> 01:08:13,168
Yes, l was telling a story about my,
 about our father.

962
01:08:13,169 --> 01:08:16,169
Oh, you were?

963
01:08:16,969 --> 01:08:19,969
l don't want to be rude,
but may l have a drink?

964
01:08:23,329 --> 01:08:26,329
 l had three or four before l came, but
they're wearing off, you know how that is.

965
01:08:29,009 --> 01:08:31,768
 Don't look at me like that.
You like a little drink yourself.

966
01:08:31,769 --> 01:08:34,769
We call him Jerry the Nipper.

967
01:08:36,289 --> 01:08:39,289
Likes to sneak it when nobody's looking.
 So cute about it, too.

968
01:08:39,489 --> 01:08:42,489
 l've seen him go an evening,
apparently having nothing to drink...

969
01:08:46,009 --> 01:08:48,008
and all of a sudden, fall flat on his puss.

970
01:08:48,009 --> 01:08:51,009
A glass of sherry, perhaps?

971
01:08:51,969 --> 01:08:54,848
Will you get Miss Warriner
 a glass of sherry?

972
01:08:54,849 --> 01:08:57,849
A glass of sherry? Excuse me.

973
01:08:59,209 --> 01:09:02,209
l don't like sherry.

974
01:09:06,489 --> 01:09:09,489
-Would you make that ginger ale please?
 -Ginger ale?

975
01:09:11,049 --> 01:09:14,049
l'm sorry to interrupt you again, Jerry.
 Now, what were you saying?

976
01:09:14,929 --> 01:09:17,008
l was just telling one of Father's stories.
 You've heard it.

977
01:09:17,009 --> 01:09:19,568
With a minute to go, Dad had the ball--

978
01:09:19,569 --> 01:09:22,569
-A ball? What ball?
 -The football.

979
01:09:23,729 --> 01:09:26,729
What in the world was Dad ever doing
 with a football?

980
01:09:28,169 --> 01:09:31,008
l was just telling a story about when Father
 was at Princeton. You remember--

981
01:09:31,009 --> 01:09:33,528
Oh, yes, of course l remember.
 Pop loved Princeton.

982
01:09:33,529 --> 01:09:36,529
He was there nearly 20 years.

983
01:09:36,849 --> 01:09:39,849
lf ever a man loved a place, he did.
 He just adored it.

984
01:09:40,569 --> 01:09:42,528
And he certainly kept it looking beautiful.

985
01:09:42,529 --> 01:09:45,128
You've seen the grounds, of course.

986
01:09:45,129 --> 01:09:47,288
Of course?

987
01:09:47,289 --> 01:09:48,608
 -Thank you.
-l'm afraid l'm--

988
01:09:48,609 --> 01:09:50,608
So sorry!

989
01:09:50,609 --> 01:09:53,609
-Here's your handkerchief.
 -Thank you.

990
01:09:54,249 --> 01:09:55,248
 l'm afraid that my sister
has a somewhat distorted sense of humour.

991
01:09:55,249 --> 01:09:57,888
So have l.

992
01:09:57,889 --> 01:10:00,889
 What she meant was,
Father presented the college...

993
01:10:01,449 --> 01:10:04,449
with some of its finest landscapings.

994
01:10:09,449 --> 01:10:12,449
 Excuse me. Was l thirsty!
lt must have been that ham l had for dinner.

995
01:10:12,889 --> 01:10:15,048
-l think my brother's pretty swell, don't you?
 -Oh, yes.

996
01:10:15,049 --> 01:10:17,608
He's always been pretty swell to me.

997
01:10:17,609 --> 01:10:20,609
l was working my head off
 at the Virginia Club.

998
01:10:21,449 --> 01:10:24,449
But the minute he started doing better,
 you know what l mean...

999
01:10:26,089 --> 01:10:28,888
 why, he made me give up my job
and take a trip to London and Paris...

1000
01:10:28,889 --> 01:10:30,808
and.... l think that was pretty swell,
 don't you?

1001
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:33,208
What did you do at the Virginia Club?

1002
01:10:33,209 --> 01:10:36,209
 -You see--
-l'll tell her!

1003
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:38,648
lt was a little act, kind of....

1004
01:10:38,649 --> 01:10:41,288
Well, it's a little hard to explain.

1005
01:10:41,289 --> 01:10:44,289
-Have you got any records?
 -Records?

1006
01:10:45,369 --> 01:10:48,369
-Yes. We have some records.
 -Well, maybe if we....

1007
01:10:50,809 --> 01:10:53,328
Say, wait a minute!

1008
01:10:53,329 --> 01:10:56,329
Don't anybody leave this room.
 l've lost my purse.

1009
01:10:58,089 --> 01:10:59,728
 -Why, here it is.
-Well, am l relieved.

1010
01:10:59,729 --> 01:11:02,729
Where are the records?

1011
01:11:03,049 --> 01:11:06,049
Come this way and l'll show you.

1012
01:11:10,169 --> 01:11:13,169
Look, will you keep an eye on that for me?

1013
01:11:13,329 --> 01:11:16,128
 Here's my song.
Would you like to have me do it for you?

1014
01:11:16,129 --> 01:11:19,129
-Well, no, l don't--
 -Okay.

1015
01:11:20,249 --> 01:11:22,968
You'll have to put that on.
 lt's a little fancy for me.

1016
01:11:22,969 --> 01:11:24,488
The one we've got at home, you just wind.

1017
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:26,848
l wouldn't, if l were you.

1018
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:29,248
l won't do it the way l did at the club...

1019
01:11:29,249 --> 01:11:32,008
if that's what you're afraid of.

1020
01:11:32,009 --> 01:11:33,848
You think l'm a fool?

1021
01:11:33,849 --> 01:11:36,849
The number has some wind effects...

1022
01:11:49,409 --> 01:11:52,409
 but you'll just have to use
your own imagination about them.

1023
01:12:21,649 --> 01:12:24,649
Get it?

1024
01:12:29,569 --> 01:12:31,568
l never could do that.

1025
01:12:31,569 --> 01:12:33,648
Are we going so soon?

1026
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:36,649
l was just beginning to enjoy myself.

1027
01:12:41,289 --> 01:12:44,088
Good night. Good night, all.

1028
01:12:44,089 --> 01:12:47,089
 -Where are you going?
-l'm going to Patsy's cabin.

1029
01:12:48,449 --> 01:12:49,768
 -You're not in any condition to drive.
-l can make it in two minutes on two wheels.

1030
01:12:49,769 --> 01:12:52,688
That's what you think.

1031
01:12:52,689 --> 01:12:53,808
 -Get over.
-This is my car. l want to drive my car.

1032
01:12:53,809 --> 01:12:56,809
-Over.
 -No.

1033
01:12:57,249 --> 01:13:00,249
-l wish you'd stayed in there.
 -That's right.

1034
01:13:03,609 --> 01:13:06,408
Would you mind shutting that off,
 or at least turning it down?

1035
01:13:06,409 --> 01:13:09,409
Give it to me.

1036
01:13:11,889 --> 01:13:13,728
That's right, put it where we can find it.

1037
01:13:13,729 --> 01:13:16,729
-Here, you can't do that.
 -What?

1038
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:19,608
-Shut that thing off.
 -What?

1039
01:13:19,609 --> 01:13:20,768
 lt's against the law.
Besides, you'll wake everyone up.

1040
01:13:20,769 --> 01:13:23,769
What?

1041
01:13:25,169 --> 01:13:28,169
He says we'll wake up....

1042
01:13:50,409 --> 01:13:53,409
Why don't you help me?

1043
01:13:53,649 --> 01:13:55,968
-lt's beautiful up here, don't you think so?
 -Sure, it's swell.

1044
01:13:55,969 --> 01:13:56,968
lf it wasn't for you, l'd have missed all this.

1045
01:13:56,969 --> 01:13:58,968
That's right.

1046
01:13:58,969 --> 01:14:01,448
l suppose by the time l get to town...

1047
01:14:01,449 --> 01:14:03,488
it will hardly be worthwhile going to bed.

1048
01:14:03,489 --> 01:14:06,008
You mind if l use your car to go home?

1049
01:14:06,009 --> 01:14:07,768
 No, l don't mind,
only l think it's awfully silly.

1050
01:14:07,769 --> 01:14:09,808
Patsy will be disappointed.

1051
01:14:09,809 --> 01:14:12,808
Well, thanks. l'll go home.

1052
01:14:12,809 --> 01:14:15,288
 lt's all right with me.
My goodness, l just thought....

1053
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:18,289
 Yes, you just thought
that if l'd stay up there...

1054
01:14:20,969 --> 01:14:23,928
 you'd show me exactly how innocent
a night in the country can be, didn't you?

1055
01:14:23,929 --> 01:14:26,688
 Are you still harping
on that same old string?

1056
01:14:26,689 --> 01:14:29,689
 lt doesn't matter to me
whether you go or stay.

1057
01:14:39,089 --> 01:14:41,088
 l was just trying
to make it easier for you, that's all.

1058
01:14:41,089 --> 01:14:43,848
Did you have to throw that gadget away?

1059
01:14:43,849 --> 01:14:46,808
You want me to go back and look for it?

1060
01:14:46,809 --> 01:14:49,809
What else can happen to us?

1061
01:14:50,529 --> 01:14:52,848
A lot.

1062
01:14:52,849 --> 01:14:55,408
 -What's that?
-Two motorcycles.

1063
01:14:55,409 --> 01:14:58,409
-Anybody riding them?
 -There are two men.

1064
01:14:59,689 --> 01:15:02,689
-Are they in uniform?
 -Yes.

1065
01:15:13,369 --> 01:15:15,328
Fine.

1066
01:15:15,329 --> 01:15:17,488
-Turn down that radio.
 -l can't.

1067
01:15:17,489 --> 01:15:20,168
What do you mean you can't?

1068
01:15:20,169 --> 01:15:23,169
 You lost the control?
You can't let it run that way!

1069
01:15:23,809 --> 01:15:26,288
 -Let me take a look at it.
-Wait a minute, l'll get out of your way.

1070
01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:29,289
See what you can do.

1071
01:15:35,009 --> 01:15:38,009
-Help me to sort the wiring.
 -Let's take a look at it.

1072
01:15:39,449 --> 01:15:41,528
Don't!

1073
01:15:41,529 --> 01:15:44,128
lt's always good.

1074
01:15:44,129 --> 01:15:45,608
Do you know you can get a ticket for that?

1075
01:15:45,609 --> 01:15:48,128
-ls this your car?
 -Nope!

1076
01:15:48,129 --> 01:15:50,328
 -Whose car is it?
-l'll give you one more guess.

1077
01:15:50,329 --> 01:15:53,329
So it's yours. Where's your ownership card?

1078
01:15:53,809 --> 01:15:55,408
-ln my bureau's upper right-hand drawer.
 -Are you sure this is your car?

1079
01:15:55,409 --> 01:15:58,409
Of course l'm sure!

1080
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:01,368
lf it's your car, what's the license number?
 What is it?

1081
01:16:01,369 --> 01:16:04,369
l don't know. They change it every year.

1082
01:16:06,169 --> 01:16:09,169
 Don't look now,
but what's the number on your motorcycle?

1083
01:16:10,049 --> 01:16:13,049
-Have you folks been drinking?
 -No, l haven't, but....

1084
01:16:14,489 --> 01:16:17,489
-Let me see you walk this line.
 -Come on.

1085
01:16:32,969 --> 01:16:35,968
Go on, honey, truck it!

1086
01:16:35,969 --> 01:16:38,969
-Now what have you done?
 -The brakes are bad.

1087
01:16:39,649 --> 01:16:42,649
 lt's a bad break for us, too.
Now we haven't any transportation.

1088
01:16:43,609 --> 01:16:46,609
 Could you two gentlemen take us
to my aunt's cabin? lt's only 15 miles.

1089
01:16:46,929 --> 01:16:48,208
-That is, if you've nothing else to do.
 -No, l don't.

1090
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:51,128
-Have you?
 -Oh, no.

1091
01:16:51,129 --> 01:16:52,448
Oh, that's fine.

1092
01:16:52,449 --> 01:16:55,449
Where will you sit?

1093
01:17:35,569 --> 01:17:38,569
l'll have to figure that one out, l guess.

1094
01:17:58,529 --> 01:18:01,529
Come on, try it. lt's fun!

1095
01:18:02,489 --> 01:18:04,168
 Now, listen, you two.
Don't say a word to this guy.

1096
01:18:04,169 --> 01:18:06,728
Who are these people?

1097
01:18:06,729 --> 01:18:09,729
Why, that's Mrs. Warriner
 and that's Mr. Warriner.

1098
01:18:09,929 --> 01:18:11,048
How do you do?

1099
01:18:11,049 --> 01:18:14,049
Hello.

1100
01:18:15,009 --> 01:18:18,009
 l guess that settles it.
Will you get my car out in the morning?

1101
01:18:19,649 --> 01:18:22,608
ln the meantime, think of something
 you'd like for Christmas. Goodbye.

1102
01:18:22,609 --> 01:18:24,288
-l hope you have a nice trip back.
 -Thank you.

1103
01:18:24,289 --> 01:18:25,408
Hi, Dad.

1104
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:27,048
Hello, Dad.

1105
01:18:27,049 --> 01:18:30,049
Everything all right with you?

1106
01:18:30,569 --> 01:18:32,928
-Oh, l'm feeling fine.
 -That's good.

1107
01:18:32,929 --> 01:18:34,448
But l wasn't expecting nobody tonight.

1108
01:18:34,449 --> 01:18:37,168
lsn't Aunt Patsy here?

1109
01:18:37,169 --> 01:18:39,728
 -Well, no.
-She isn't here?

1110
01:18:39,729 --> 01:18:41,368
-But l thought for sure she was here.
 -l didn't.

1111
01:18:41,369 --> 01:18:43,128
lsn't that funny?

1112
01:18:43,129 --> 01:18:45,488
Let me get you some coffee.

1113
01:18:45,489 --> 01:18:48,489
Oh, no, l don't think so, Dad.

1114
01:18:51,689 --> 01:18:53,168
 lt might keep me awake.
l'm going right to bed. l'm awfully tired.

1115
01:18:53,169 --> 01:18:55,808
See? She's all in.

1116
01:18:55,809 --> 01:18:58,168
-Oh, Dad, is this room in order?
 -Yes.

1117
01:18:58,169 --> 01:19:01,169
That's fine. Mr. Warriner will sleep in there.

1118
01:19:01,689 --> 01:19:02,808
Give him a couple of nice warm blankets.
 He has a bad cold.

1119
01:19:02,809 --> 01:19:05,568
ls that right?

1120
01:19:05,569 --> 01:19:08,569
 l've had a bad cold now
for some considerable time.

1121
01:19:09,849 --> 01:19:11,368
 -That's too bad.
-About three months.

1122
01:19:11,369 --> 01:19:13,648
How are you doing in there?

1123
01:19:13,649 --> 01:19:15,008
l'm having a little wardrobe trouble.

1124
01:19:15,009 --> 01:19:17,808
You should see me.

1125
01:19:17,809 --> 01:19:20,809
l'm glad you told him l have a cold.
 He fixed me up good.

1126
01:19:27,249 --> 01:19:30,249
 My nightie is coming to me
through the courtesy of Aunt Patsy.

1127
01:19:56,689 --> 01:19:59,689
Go, get off!

1128
01:20:00,769 --> 01:20:03,769
Air-conditioned.

1129
01:20:07,089 --> 01:20:10,089
-What's wrong with this?
 -l don't know.

1130
01:20:11,089 --> 01:20:13,528
The lock isn't very practical, is it?

1131
01:20:13,529 --> 01:20:16,529
No, it's not so very practical....

1132
01:20:19,609 --> 01:20:22,609
l guess it will serve its purpose.

1133
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:26,569
Well, good night.

1134
01:20:47,889 --> 01:20:50,688
Good night.

1135
01:20:50,689 --> 01:20:53,689
l'm afraid we're going to have trouble
 with this.

1136
01:20:56,889 --> 01:20:59,889
l guess l'll be all right.

1137
01:21:01,169 --> 01:21:04,169
-Good night.
-Good night.

1138
01:22:03,809 --> 01:22:05,848
Good night.

1139
01:22:05,849 --> 01:22:08,849
l told you we'd have trouble with this.

1140
01:22:14,449 --> 01:22:17,449
Yes.

1141
01:22:18,769 --> 01:22:20,568
 ln a half an hour,
we'll no longer be Mr. and Mrs.

1142
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:23,569
Funny, isn't it?

1143
01:22:25,609 --> 01:22:28,609
 Yes, it's funny that everything
is the way it is, on account of how you feel.

1144
01:22:30,969 --> 01:22:33,969
 l mean, if you didn't feel how you do,
things wouldn't be as they are, would they?

1145
01:22:36,369 --> 01:22:39,088
l mean, things could be the same
 if things were different.

1146
01:22:39,089 --> 01:22:42,089
-But things are the way you made them.
 -Oh, no.

1147
01:22:42,889 --> 01:22:45,728
Things are the way you think l made them.
 l didn't make them that way at all.

1148
01:22:45,729 --> 01:22:48,448
Things are just the same
 as they always were...

1149
01:22:48,449 --> 01:22:51,449
only you're the same as you were, too...

1150
01:22:59,169 --> 01:23:02,169
 so l guess things
will never be the same again.

1151
01:23:10,169 --> 01:23:12,608
Good night.

1152
01:23:12,609 --> 01:23:15,609
-Got caught in the door.
 -Good night.

1153
01:24:41,369 --> 01:24:44,369
Good night.

1154
01:24:49,889 --> 01:24:52,889
Why, you....

1155
01:24:52,969 --> 01:24:55,969
l was trying to stop it.

1156
01:25:11,209 --> 01:25:14,209
Well, there it goes again.

1157
01:25:15,009 --> 01:25:16,848
You're all confused, aren't you?

1158
01:25:16,849 --> 01:25:19,568
-Aren't you?
 -No.

1159
01:25:19,569 --> 01:25:21,648
You should be. You're wrong
about things being different...

1160
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:24,528
because they're not the same.

1161
01:25:24,529 --> 01:25:27,488
 Things are different,
except in a different way.

1162
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:29,528
You're still the same, only l've been a fool.

1163
01:25:29,529 --> 01:25:31,848
But l'm not now.

1164
01:25:31,849 --> 01:25:33,968
As long as l'm different, don't you think...

1165
01:25:33,969 --> 01:25:36,048
maybe things could be the same again...

1166
01:25:36,049 --> 01:25:38,408
only a little different?

1167
01:25:38,409 --> 01:25:40,048
You mean that, Jerry?

1168
01:25:40,049 --> 01:25:43,049
Are you sure?

1169
01:25:46,009 --> 01:25:48,488
No more doubts? No more being....

1170
01:25:48,489 --> 01:25:51,489
 -Except....
-Except what?

1171
01:25:53,769 --> 01:25:56,769
-There's only one thing that bothers me.
 -What?

1172
01:25:58,089 --> 01:26:01,089
This darn lock.

1173
01:26:05,489 --> 01:26:08,489
ls that all?

1174
01:26:27,049 --> 01:26:30,049
You think maybe if you....

1175
01:26:31,305 --> 01:26:37,633
