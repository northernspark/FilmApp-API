2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,200
Nice. Sorry, good catch.

3
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,400
Boys, lunch is ready.

4
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,400
Here we go.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,900
Ain't no doubt about it, lady,
you got a shitload of rats down there.

6
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,800
Damn, is it 3:00?
l gotta get out of here.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,700
But wait,
what about my basement?

8
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,800
Well, just call and make a follow-up
appointment. lt's no problem.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,500
But...

10
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Bring it in, here you go.

11
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,700
Got one of those for me?

12
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,200
Nice try, you little creep.

13
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,300
Mr. Buttermaker.

14
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,700
Mr. Buttermaker. You're late.

15
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,500
l got held up, sorry about that.

16
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,200
Jesus! Are you drinking?

17
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,600
Hell, no. That's nonalcoholic.
l'm driving, you know.

18
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,500
l'm so sorry.

19
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,600
You hear that, Toby?
Drinking and driving don't mix.

20
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,500
That's right.
Stay away from crack too.

21
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,500
One hit of that,
and you'll wake up in prison

22
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,100
married to some guy
named Big Blue,

23
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,900
and he's branding his initials in
your ass with a hot coat hanger.

24
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,200
l knew a guy.

25
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Yes, crack is bad too.

26
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,100
Yeah, l know.

27
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,400
But we are really excited
to have you do this,

28
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,600
and Toby is really excited to play,
aren't you, honey?

29
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,300
Between his trumpet lessons,
photo club, Boy Scouts and swimming,

30
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,200
this is his favorite, isn't it, honey?

31
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,200
Can you believe they tried to
keep these kids out of the league?

32
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,000
All kids should be able to play baseball,
no matter what their skills.

33
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,100
Well, l think they heard me
loud and clear.

34
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,400
All that aside,
forget l filed the injunction.

35
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,900
Just go out there and have fun.

36
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,600
Don't let the legalese crimp
your enthusiasm in any way.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah, l got enthusiasm
flying out my ass.

38
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Got the check?

39
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,600
lt's a shame none of the fathers
could be here.

40
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,100
ls that thing glued to your fingers?

41
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,800
l almost forgot.

42
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,000
l think it's really important,
what we're doing for the kids.

43
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,500
l feel really good about it, don't you?

44
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,700
Yeah.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,600
Toby, have fun.

46
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,200
- Mr. Buttermaker?
- Yeah.

47
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,300
ls it true you were on the Mariners?

48
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,400
Long ago and far away.

49
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,700
Here, carry that.

50
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,300
Where do we get the equipment?

51
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,600
Over there.

52
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,000
Sorry the stuff's so ratty,
but this is a six-team league,

53
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,600
and l'm afraid your boys are getting
the S-H-l-T end of the stick.

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,900
Yeah, l can spell ''shit,'' all right.

55
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,400
Does she think l'm 1 1 ?

56
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,700
Girl softball players.

57
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,400
l think we all know
what that means, right?

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,100
- How you doing? Ray Bullock.
- Hey, Morris Buttermaker--

59
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,200
No, no, no.
No introduction necessary.

60
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,200
Morris ''The Blade'' Buttermaker.

61
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,000
Carving up batters, one by one.

62
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,300
Sound familiar? l used to watch you
over at Regis Field in high school.

63
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,800
You were amazing. Man, l was
just a kid, but you owned it.

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,200
lt's great you're doing this, Morris.
Really.

65
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,500
l mean, a pro. Finally,
somebody who gets it, you know?

66
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,100
l gotta tell you,
a lot of these dads, they don't--

67
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,600
They don't understand the dedication
that it takes to run a serious program.

68
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,400
No offense, but that ''Ms.'' Whitewood
friend of yours,

69
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
she's not helping things, you know.

70
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,900
l mean, yeah, l get it,
we were a little selective.

71
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,600
Kept some of the lesser players out.

72
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,100
But stopping the season
till we complied?

73
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,000
Come on.

74
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,200
This is a serious program.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,700
Not because l want it that way, either.
lt's for the kids, you know?

76
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,400
Listen to me going on and on.
You know what it takes.

77
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,700
Anyway, l think we're gonna
have a lot of fun.

78
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,800
Learn a lot from each other,
you know?

79
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,400
You know, l never thought
l'd hear myself say,

80
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,300
''Look at the ass
on that second baseman.''

81
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,000
But look at the ass
on that second baseman.

82
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,100
A lot of brisket butt.

83
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,100
All right.

84
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,500
Well, listen, l'll see you around.

85
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,000
Or stop by, see me sometime.
l'm over at Chevy Valley Subaru.

86
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,400
''Quality you can drive.''

87
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,000
All you need is a jar of honey
and a glass coffee table.

88
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,900
lt's more fun than a taffy pull,
l promise you.

89
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,400
Buttermaker!

90
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,000
Buttermaker, they're here.

91
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,800
See you later, Buttermaker.

92
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,800
Come on.

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,900
Kid, let me explain
something to you, okay?

94
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,800
All right, listen up.

95
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,400
- Tanner Boyle.
- Yeah, here.

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,300
- Mike Engelberg.
- Here.

97
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,400
Timmy Lupus?

98
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Timmy Lupus?

99
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,400
Raise your hand, Lupus.
He can't see you sitting behind

100
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,300
- Planet Fat Ass.
- Up your cornhole, Tanner.

101
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,300
Come on, come on.
Play nice.

102
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,000
Hey, hey.
Let go of him.

103
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,400
- Prem Lahiri?
- Present.

104
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,900
But you don't have to use me.

105
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,300
l'm just doing this for
my transcript, for college.

106
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,600
Okay.

107
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,900
Let's see, Toby White--
Oh, Whitewood, l know you're here.

108
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,200
Matthew Hooper?

109
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,800
Matthew Hooper?

110
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
Okay, no Hooper.

111
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
The hell?

112
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,000
Garo Dara-gaga-braga-dagian.
What the hell is that,

113
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
- Aztec or something?
- Armenian.

114
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,400
Same shit. They both built pyramids.
All right.

115
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,500
- Ahmad Abdul Rahim?
- Here.

116
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,100
Yo, bro, what up?

117
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,400
Nothing much. Just ready
to play some baseball.

118
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,200
Twenty-five, huh?

119
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
- Ken Griffey, right?
- No.

120
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,200
- Satchel Paige?
- No.

121
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,900
No? Willie Mays?

122
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,100
No, it's Mark McGwire.

123
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,000
Mark McGwire? But he's a white.

124
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,800
Yes, he's from Claremont.
He's my favorite player.

125
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,300
Okay.

126
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,400
Agilar. Miguel and Jose.

127
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,000
You guys twins?

128
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,000
You can save it, son.

129
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,300
l don't understand a damn thing
you're saying, okay?

130
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,200
All right.

131
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Got the damn
League of Nations here.

132
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,800
Their dad's our gardener. Mom said
we need them to fill out the team.

133
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,600
Okay, let's hit the field. Come on.

134
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,400
- Jeez. Could this team be any lamer?
- So there's no Hooper?

135
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,800
You don't know
a Matthew Hooper?

136
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,300
- You know where he is?
- Right here.

137
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,000
You gotta be shitting me.

138
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,000
That's right, l'm in a wheelchair.

139
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,800
Okay.

140
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,500
Charge it.

141
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,700
Oh, yeah, that's charging it, all right.

142
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,800
Good hustle.

143
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,700
There you go, bro.
Another good one.

144
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,700
What's the--?
What's the cripple kid's name?

145
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,600
- Hooper.
- Hooper. Hooper!

146
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,100
Roll your machine up.

147
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,700
Don't necessarily
have to catch it, l guess.

148
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,500
Can't hope for miracles, can you?

149
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,500
You gotta get under the ball.

150
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,300
There's too many gnats out here.

151
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,200
Give me a ball.

152
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,400
What the hell is that,
a baggie full of bacon?

153
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,700
- l'm on Atkins.
- What?

154
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,300
l have to eat all the time
to keep my metabolism up

155
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
so my body becomes
a fat-burning machine

156
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,100
so assholes like you
don't give me shit all the time!

157
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,600
Easy, sport.

158
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,500
All right, get ready. lt's coming at you.
You might want to back up.

159
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,500
Guys, it's a bunt.

160
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,900
You seemed to imply you're
going to hit it out here.

161
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,500
Yeah. Engelberg, that's a bunt, bud.

162
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,800
You're supposed to pick it up,
throw the guy out at first base, okay?

163
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,800
Here we go again,
picking on the fat kid.

164
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,900
There's laws against this, you know.
Harassment!

165
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,500
You better shut up before l tell
somebody you touched my pecker.

166
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,700
Engelberg, will you throw
the goddamn ball already?

167
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Okay, listen up.

168
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,300
Listen very carefully.

169
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,100
Rule number one:
Don't mess with the Cadillac.

170
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,100
Calm down,
it's a piece of crap anyway.

171
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,900
For your information, it's a classic.

172
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,300
And l got half a mind to find your old
man and kick him in the nuts so hard

173
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,600
he can never foul the earth
with another little shit like you.

174
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,700
So you keep your trap shut, okay?

175
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,500
We're gonna get laughed at. We only
have a week till the season starts.

176
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,500
Everyone's gonna laugh at us.

177
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,200
This game is about a lot more
than talent, son, believe me.

178
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,700
l'll say. l left more talent floating
in the shitter this morning

179
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,100
than all you retarded
jerk-offs put together.

180
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,100
You got a problem, dingleberry?

181
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,400
Give me a few minutes,
l'll squeeze out a new coach too.

182
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,800
l'll teach you, you little short kid!

183
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,300
- Jesus.
- l'll teach you to mess with me.

184
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,900
Does your mama change
your underwear too, you little girl?

185
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,300
l'm out there with the kids for nothing.
And l'm getting very tired

186
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,200
of having to justify myself
to parents who drop the kid off at 4:00,

187
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,500
call me at midnight wondering
why he's so pissed off.

188
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,100
- Ray, you got a minute--?
- l want to say to them, ''l'm not

189
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,000
your babysitter. l'm your coach.''

190
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,300
Oh, yeah.

191
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,900
Mr. Bill Deaver.

192
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,000
Hey, just checking in.

193
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,700
Just checking in. Listen, Ray,
l wanted to see

194
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,000
if maybe Jake could get a little
more playing time this season.

195
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,100
He's been working hard.
lt would really mean a lot to him.

196
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,700
Yeah, sure.

197
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,700
- Why not?
- Really? Well, great.

198
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,400
Thanks a lot, Ray.

199
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Guys.

200
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,600
You know, l spoke to your boy.
You know what he said to me?

201
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,700
- What?
- He said all that matters to him

202
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,300
is that we win.

203
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,500
Even if it means giving up
a little game time.

204
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

205
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,600
l was really touched by this.
He's a hell of a team player.

206
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,600
Thanks, Ray. l appreciate it.

207
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,200
That's the kind of
horseshit l'm talking about.

208
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,900
- Exactly.
- Unbelievable.

209
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,700
Hey, Buttermaker, you made it.

210
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,500
And you brought...

211
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,600
Oh, this is my friend Paradise.

212
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
Hi, nice to meet you.

213
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,900
Hey, Buttermaker, you gotta get
your uniform orders in.

214
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,800
- Uniforms?
- Yeah.

215
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,700
All the good colors are taken:
Black and white, red and white,

216
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,800
blue and white, white and blue,
white and black,

217
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,900
white and red. They're all gone.

218
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,800
What uniforms?

219
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,700
<i>Mochte ich nicht</i> sweet and sour,
okay? No sweet and sour.

220
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,700
Just Cointreau, Patron,
lime juice and superfine salt.

221
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,900
- Yes, ma'am.
- Listen, Whitewood, what's the deal

222
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,200
- with the uniforms?
- What about them?

223
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,900
l didn't-- What's-her-name said
that l gotta have uniforms.

224
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,000
Hey, buddy, give me a beer
and a C&C.

225
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,000
Buttermaker, you don't actually buy
them. You just need a sponsor.

226
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,300
You're the coach, it's your job.

227
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Okay, so not only do l have to
coach the bronze medalists

228
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,600
for the Special Olympics, but l gotta be
an Amway salesman too, is that it?

229
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,900
Buttermaker, don't turn this
into high drama.

230
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,400
Do what other coaches do:

231
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,900
Restaurants, sporting goods stores,
you know.

232
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,300
You know, l got a job.

233
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,900
l got houses to spray.
lt's ant season, you know?

234
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,300
What is it about being a man
that makes everything so hard?

235
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
l own my own law firm.

236
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,100
l'm a single mother, and l still
have time for extension courses,

237
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,600
Pilates, the flower-seed business,
pottery--

238
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,100
You know what, l'm busy too, okay?
l got important shit to do.

239
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,200
l got shit stacked up
all over the place.

240
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,800
lmportant man shit, okay?

241
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,400
Come on, Buttermaker, let's go.

242
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,000
Mr. Buttermaker?

243
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
- Yeah.
- Where are we going?

244
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,700
l already told you,
to the batting cages.

245
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,200
You guys swing like Helen Keller
at a pinata party.

246
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,700
l'm gonna do something about it.

247
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,600
-Tell us about the majors, coach.
-You were in the majors?

248
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,300
Yeah, for a little while.

249
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,100
Hey, Lupus, don't lean against
that door, bud, all right?

250
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,300
Yes, l was recently perusing
baseballstats.org

251
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,400
and it said Mr. Buttermaker played
pitcher for the Seattle Mariners

252
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,400
for two-thirds of an inning in 1 984.

253
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,400
Two-thirds, that's it?

254
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,200
Well, it was the end of the season,
you know, September call-ups.

255
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,100
Yes, his lifetime ERA was 36.

256
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,400
That's lame.

257
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,800
Yeah, well l closed
the inning out, okay.

258
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,600
There's only a few thousand guys ever
set foot on a major-league mound,

259
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,900
and l'm one of them. What have
you done with your life, smart-ass?

260
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,500
Why didn't you stay?

261
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,900
Well, l was gonna come back,
but l had a little incident.

262
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,700
l punched an ump.
Really just a bitch-slap.

263
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,000
How the hell was l supposed to know
he was a bleeder?

264
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,400
Fourteen stitches.
Like that means something.

265
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,700
They used to stitch everything up,
goddamn it. lt was like the Dark Ages.

266
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,400
l got stitches on my foot.

267
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,700
Oh, yeah?
Well, l'm in a damn wheelchair.

268
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,800
Anyway, after that,
l blew off a few offers,

269
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,100
you know, Japan, shit like that.
You know what l mean?

270
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,400
Shit.

271
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,100
What the hell?

272
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,100
ls he okay?

273
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,000
Lupus.

274
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,000
Lupus?

275
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,800
Lupus?

276
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,600
Lupus.

277
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,300
What the hell are you grinning at?

278
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,200
You scared the hell out of me.
Don't be leaning on the door.

279
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,700
How many are in there?

280
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,100
The infestation's quite advanced.

281
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,800
All right, pull the pin. Throw it.

282
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,600
There you go. Good job, buddy.
Good job, man. You're a natural.

283
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,000
A natural at that shit.

284
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,300
Thanks.

285
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,000
Die! Die! How do you like that, huh?

286
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,600
Hey, you sprayed my foot,
dumb-ass.

287
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,200
Oh, yeah?

288
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,700
Stop it!

289
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,600
That shit's expensive, all right?

290
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,900
Hey, coach,
what's ''carcinogen'' mean?

291
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,800
Liberal propaganda.
Don't worry about it. lt's just bullshit.

292
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,600
Buttermaker, l got these
behind the garage.

293
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,900
Throw them in the garbage,
in the house.

294
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,700
Hey, save the traps, will you?

295
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,700
Thanks for holding
the fort down, buddy.

296
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,600
l got something for you.
You're gonna dig this.

297
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,200
Hey, guys, come here a minute.

298
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,800
l got something for you.

299
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,600
Now you can quit your bitching
about the whole uniform thing.

300
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,100
Here you go.

301
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,900
- Harper. Heads up, buddy.
- Awesome!

302
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,600
Hooper.

303
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,500
Cannonball!

304
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,300
Jesus Christ.

305
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Hey, Engelberg, if you do that again,
you'll learn how to surf.

306
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,100
Mr. Buttermaker,
we have a game tomorrow.

307
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,500
Shouldn't we be practicing?

308
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,200
Lupus, alcohol.

309
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,300
Excellent. God bless you.

310
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,900
- You got a future, Lupus.
- You ever play with anyone famous?

311
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,900
Hell, yeah, l played with people
who are famous.

312
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,100
What do you think? l mean,
l was in the game, you know.

313
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,000
Oh, l know one.

314
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,900
One time l struck out Mike Schmidt
in an exhibition game.

315
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,700
Struck his ass right out. Yeah, l did.

316
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,400
lt was 1 980.

317
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,100
lt was two outs,
bottom of the seventh inning.

318
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,500
lt was the bottom of the seventh--
Top of the seventh.

319
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,600
lt was top of the seventh.

320
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,500
And when l put my foot on that rubber,
l was zoned in, man.

321
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,300
lt was just one
of those times when...

322
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,200
You just know you got
your shit working, you know?

323
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,200
All right, tubby, l'm gonna throw you
something called a screwball.

324
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,400
lt's an old-school thing. Now, it's gonna
look like it's coming right at you,

325
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,200
but it's gonna drop right off the table.
So you don't bail out,

326
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,200
you gotta stick in there.
You see what l'm saying?

327
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,500
Son of a bitch!

328
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,400
Shake it off.

329
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,400
Next.

330
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,700
- Damn it!
- l know it stings a little bit,

331
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,700
but it's worth it.

332
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,000
Okay, here it comes.

333
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,100
lt's all right, kid. You had a helmet on.
lmagine if you didn't.

334
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,900
You know what l'm saying?

335
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,600
What are you doing, Buttermaker?

336
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,300
Okay, coming at you.

337
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Mr. Buttermaker?

338
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,400
- ls he dead?
- Hell, no. He's drunk.

339
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
The season starts tomorrow.

340
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,600
We don't got our positions,
batting order, nothing.

341
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,300
- What are we going to do?
- We ain't ready to play.

342
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,700
We got nothing but a boozer
for a coach.

343
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,700
We can wait till he sobers up.

344
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,400
- Yeah, right.
- Nothing else we can do.

345
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,600
Screw this, l'm taking his wallet.

346
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,600
- Give me! Give me--
- Hey, watch it!

347
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,500
- Leave me alone!
- Give me that!

348
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,200
Right this way. Good.

349
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,100
<i>Because in this time of terror,</i>

350
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,400
<i>there is one thing we all need:</i>

351
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,000
<i>the grace of our Lord,</i>

352
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,000
our heroes overseas,

353
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
and baseball.

354

''Casey at the Bat'' by Ernest Thayer.

355
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,800
<i>The outlook wasn't brilliant</i>
<i>for the Mudville nine that day.</i>

356
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,500
- <i>The score stood 4 to 2...</i>
- What a fag.

357
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,500
Buttermaker, where have you been?

358
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,600
You missed the team photo.

359
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,900
l was just getting Gatorade
for the guys, you know.

360
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:20,700
Well, we need to talk about this.
My son can't wear this.

361
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,500
We'll get him another size.
No big deal.

362
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,300
That's not what l'm talking about.

363
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,900
Look, it's a legitimate business,
honey.

364
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,500
You know, they pay taxes
like everybody else.

365
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,100
All right, can you believe it?
lt's here, opening day.

366
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,400
Well, we got a lot of great athletes
this year,

367
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,900
and l'm looking forward to
a great season.

368
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,100
Before we get started,
l do want to remind you

369
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,600
that it is Summer Discount Days
at Valley Chevy Subaru.

370
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,000
So come on down if you get a chance.
Meanwhile, so many volunteers--

371
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,900
And people that l want to thank--

372
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,100
Hey, hey, hey!

373
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,800
What is he--? What's his--?

374
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,900
Hey, get-- Get the hell off my field!

375
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,700
l'll deal with you later,
you little punk.

376
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,700
Okay, let's welcome all our teams.

377
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,900
We got...

378
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,700
Ray Bullock and our returning
champs, the Yankees.

379
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,300
Lenny Hendricks and the Giants.

380
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:02,900
Ex-Mariner, Morris Buttermaker
and the Bears.

381
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,300
<i>Bob Jones and the White Sox.</i>

382
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,200
Play ball!

383
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,000
There you go, Mitch. There you go!

384
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,500
Round it, round it, round it!

385
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,500
There you go!

386
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,900
Alrighty.

387
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,900
That's it!

388
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,800
<i>Number 9, Joey Bullock.</i>

389
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,900
That's it, that's it, that's it.

390
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,000
Go!

391
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,700
Joey! Joey!

392
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,800
That's my boy. We worked on that.

393
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,900
<i>The Yankees lead 3-nothing.</i>

394
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,800
Way to go, sweetie.

395
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,300
That's your boy.

396
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,100
- <i>Next, number 3, Danny Patello.</i>
- Let's go, Danny!

397
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,000
Go two, go two, go two!

398
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,600
What do you think, Lupus?

399
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,200
Sometimes bird poo
tastes like candy.

400
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,400
Aren't you supposed
to be in left field?

401
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,300
Shit.

402
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,500
Where you going, coach?

403
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,000
Keep your drawers on, officer,
l'll get back to you.

404
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,100
Hey, Bullock.

405
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,700
Morris ''The Blade.''

406
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,000
- l'm calling it.
- What? What are you talking about?

407
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,500
l'm calling the game. The kids are
getting creamed out there, you know?

408
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,200
- Yeah, it's a bloodbath.
- Yeah.

409
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,000
- That'll make quitters out of them.
- They don't have to quit.

410
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,700
They're losing, can't you see?

411
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,500
The 1 0-run rule kicks in after three.
l think you should hang on.

412
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,000
Yeah, then after that,
maybe you think about...

413
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,400
- What?
- You know, dropping out.

414
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,000
- What did you say?
- Dropping out of the league.

415
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,400
Morris, this isn't going to work.

416
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,600
They don't know the fundamentals
of the game out here.

417
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,400
Save them the humiliation.

418
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,400
You don't give two shits
about these kids. l'm calling the game.

419
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,800
Hey, l'm just trying to help.

420
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,900
Where's the honor and respect for the
game from the former pro, by the way?

421
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,900
Who the hell are you, Shoeless Joe
walking out of the holy cornfield?

422
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,200
l don't buy that shit.
l'm calling the game.

423
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,200
All right, call it. Quit. Quit
the whole league. What l just said.

424
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,100
All right, call it. Quit. Quit
the whole league. What l just said.

425
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,700
- Forfeit.
- Time!

426
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,000
lt's over.

427
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Bears forfeit! Game over!

428
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,200
One, two, three, Bears!

429
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,100
You guys look like
the last shit l took.

430
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:40,900
- lt's not that bad, but--
- Shut the hell up, drunk bastard!

431
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,700
Okay.

432
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,300
Hey, Bears,
thanks for batting practice.

433
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,800
Yeah, you guys suck.

434
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,600
- l'll give you batting practice!
- Come here. Come here.

435
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,900
- Get down off of there.
- Get your hands off of me!

436
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:06,000
Thanks. l really needed another
reason for people to laugh at me.

437
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,400
- Need a ride?
- Go away.

438
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,700
Come on, hop in.
l'll take you home.

439
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,300
l'm not going home.

440
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,200
All right, what's wrong?

441
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,500
My dad's not from here.

442
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,800
He thinks baseball's stupid.

443
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,500
He says l should just worry
about school and work.

444
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,100
But l want to do the things
my friends do.

445
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,500
You know, American things.

446
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,200
He said if l played,
l'd just embarrass myself.

447
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,800
l guess he was right.

448
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,300
l'm just gonna run away.

449
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,400
Where are you gonna go?

450
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,700
Salt Lake City.

451
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,200
Why the hell would you want
to go there?

452
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,700
l hear it looks like Washington D.C.

453
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,000
Listen, kid, you don't want
to go to Salt Lake, trust me.

454
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,000
They don't even like Africans
up there.

455
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,900
- Armenian.
- Yeah, right.

456
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,400
- Anyway, l think l can help you.
- Yeah?

457
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,500
- Yep.
- How?

458
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,700
Here's what you do.

459
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,900
You go home, you look your old
man straight in the eye, and you say,

460
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,200
''Guess what, Dad, we won today.''
You know.

461
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,400
- But we didn't win.
- Well, l know that.

462
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,600
You lie your ass off. lt's the only way.
Look, this is America.

463
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,200
Besides that, you know,
he's not going to know.

464
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
He's from Riki Tiki Tavi,
or wherever the hell it is.

465
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,300
l used to do it with my pop
all the time.

466
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,000
- Really?
- Yeah. You just tell them

467
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,000
what they want to hear. You know,
''l didn't take the stereo.''

468
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,600
''l don't smoke.'' ''She said
she was 1 8.'' You know, stuff like that.

469
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,500
lt's all part of growing up.
The important thing is that you're right,

470
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,400
and they're wrong.

471
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,100
Maybe l'll just tell him we tied.

472
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,200
You could do that. That'll work.

473
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,700
Now, come on,
l'll take you home. Let's go.

474
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,600
A hundred and eighty bucks?

475
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,100
That's Norma Kamali. lt's vintage.

476
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,000
They can't even make rayon
like that anymore.

477
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,000
- Really?
- Hey, does your mother know

478
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,700
you're selling that crap?

479
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,200
What are you doing here?

480
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,100
Just passing by.

481
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,900
After three years?

482
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,500
Three years?
lt's been three years?

483
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,100
Well, you sure are growing up fast,
that's for sure.

484
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
Not fast enough, if you ask me.

485
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
There's plenty of time for that,
honey.

486
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,300
Just like that story about the caterpillar
who's crawling along like a worm,

487
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,100
and then the next thing you know,
he's in that cocoon...

488
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,300
...and bam!
''Look at me now, l'm...

489
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,900
...a moth.''
Or whatever the hell they turn into.

490
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,600
l don't want wings.

491
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,000
l want nice hips and C cups.

492
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,600
Hey, don't talk like that.
What's wrong with you?

493
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,500
Come on.

494
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,100
So how's your mom?

495
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,200
She's fine. What do you care?

496
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,900
Amanda, listen, just because we
didn't get along so well all the time,

497
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,000
doesn't mean l don't
care about her, okay?

498
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,100
You know, adults, they...

499
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,200
Sometimes, l don't know, it's just--
lt's like that story l was telling you

500
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,300
about the caterpillar
and the worm deal.

501
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,000
You just walked out, you jerk.
You could have said goodbye.

502
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,500
Well, l'm sorry.

503
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,600
So, what do you want?
Why are you here?

504
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,100
l'm coaching a team out in the Valley,
and l was just thinking, you know,

505
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,700
maybe you might want
to come play with us.

506
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,000
No way. l'm a woman now,
and we don't do that kind of thing.

507
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,300
Well, sure you do.
Girls play baseball all the time.

508
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,800
Besides that, you owe me.

509
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,600
l was like a dad to you.

510
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,000
A drunk, lazy dad.

511
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,000
You made me climb under houses
looking for rats.

512
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,000
Well, that's what my dad did.
Builds character.

513
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,700
- This guy bothering you, Amanda?
- No, it's okay. He was just going.

514
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,200
Go away, Boilermaker.
You're scaring off the clientele.

515
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:31,600
Designer jeans.
Calvins, Jordache, certified vintage.

516
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,700
What do you say there, Hooper?

517
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,500
Feeling ready today?
Gonna go get them?

518
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,400
What's with the eye patch?

519
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,300
You gonna swab the on-deck circle
for us, matey?

520
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,800
Playing pirate?

521
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Mom says l have cancer of the eye.

522
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,900
What the hell's wrong
with you guys?

523
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,400
We don't want to play no more.

524
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,800
We took a vote.
We're disbanding the team.

525
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,100
So one game, you want to quit,
is that it?

526
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,400
We've been taking
a lot of crap in school.

527
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,600
By ''crap,'' he means ridicule.

528
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,900
And de-pantsing.

529
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,400
- lt's been tough.
- Really? Tough, huh?

530
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,400
What the hell happened
to you, Tanner?

531
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,000
Got in a fight.

532
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,400
- With who?
- The sixth grade.

533
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,500
The sixth grade.

534
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,400
So l guess you
want to quit too, huh?

535
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,000
Okay.

536
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,300
Look, guys, l know l've been lazy...

537
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:55,800
...and irresponsible, and a few
other things l could mention.

538
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,800
And l've let you down.

539
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,000
l mean, you know,
l've been an asshole.

540
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,300
- You know, go ahead and say it--
- <i>You're an asshole.</i>

541
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:11,400
When l say, ''say it,'' l mean,
you know, it's a figure of speech.

542
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,700
Baseball's hard, guys.
l mean, it really is.

543
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,300
You can love it, but believe me,
it don't always love you back.

544
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,700
lt's kind of like dating
a German chick, you know?

545
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:31,900
But what l do know is that once you
start quitting, it's a hard thing to stop.

546
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,900
l've quit just about everything
l ever tried in my life.

547
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,600
And as far as l can tell,

548
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,300
my life hasn't added up to
much more than a shitbag

549
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,800
full of empty promises. And l'm
not going to put that on you guys.

550
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,100
l haven't been as good a coach
as l can be. l know l can do it

551
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,200
because l know this game,
you know? And...

552
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:02,700
And we can do better, and a lot
of that's my responsibility, so...

553
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,500
l know you're down...

554
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,100
...but let's get our stuff together,
and go hit the field.

555
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,700
Okay?

556
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,800
- You with me?
- Like l said, we took a vote.

557
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,300
This is not a democracy!

558
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,600
lt is a dictatorship, and l'm Hitler!

559
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,700
You understand me?

560
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,300
So get your stuff,
and get your asses on the field!

561
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,400
This Saturday we play the Athletics.

562
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,400
And you know what
that means for the Athletics?

563
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,100
Bad news for the Athletics,
that's what it means.

564
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,800
All right, guys.
Keep the ball in front of you.

565
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,500
Keep your knees bent, your butt down.
That way if it hops either way...

566
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,100
See? You use your legs. All right?

567
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,400
You wanna run this way.
Catch the ball like that.

568
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,700
Yeah!

569
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,900
Nice!

570
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:18,100
Swivel on the back foot, throw your
hips, and keep your eye on the ball.

571
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,800
You follow the ball right into here.
You see that? Okay?

572
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,400
Try it, spark plug.

573
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,000
Swing out a little bit
when you run around the base.

574
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,500
You want to point in this direction.

575
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,300
Left foot on the inside of the bag.

576
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,400
You're gonna push off
that left foot.

577
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,900
What's with the patch?

578
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,400
Nothing. Cat scratched me.
But don't tell Buttermaker.

579
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,100
Dying.

580
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,500
Dying.

581
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,300
You know,
there's a Mennonite anecdote

582
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,000
about a simple farm hand

583
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,000
who lifted a calf every morning
until one day

584
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,200
he found himself able
to lift a cow.

585
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,700
- What the hell does that mean?
- lf we stay focused,

586
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,900
eventually our strength will build.

587
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,100
That's the dorkiest shit l've ever heard.

588
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,300
Come on, guys! Two more laps!
You're dragging ass!

589
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,800
Nice tits, Engelberg.

590
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,400
Jesus.

591
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,400
Buttermaker.

592
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,000
Glad l caught you.

593
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,500
l feel like we got off
on the wrong foot last week.

594
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,300
Said some things we
didn't mean, you know.

595
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,000
Let's forget about it, huh?

596
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,900
Sorry.

597
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,100
All right.

598
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,400
All right...

599
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,800
...you're sorry too, or...?

600
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,300
l said all right. Okay?

601
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,000
- How's that?
- How's what?

602
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,800
You feel that?

603
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,200
Feel what?

604
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,600
You know, your face
is turning a little red, Ray.

605
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,400
So, you know, what it might be

606
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,900
is those gym shorts might be
a little tight for you.

607
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,700
Looks like you're smuggling grapes
down there.

608
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,800
Smells like somebody ate
a fifth of Scotch for lunch again.

609
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,700
Not that it's any of your business,
you know.

610
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,100
- Really?
- But maybe. So...

611
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,400
All right. You know what, you keep
stinking up the ballpark, Buttermaker.

612
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,100
Yeah, okay.

613
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,600
You play your game,
we'll play ours, Ray. How's that?

614
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,000
Well, good luck with that.

615
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,200
The championship game's
gonna be a lot of fun.

616
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,300
lt would be more fun
if you guys were there, huh?

617
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,100
Oh, we'll be there, Morris.

618
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,200
Don't worry about that.

619
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,400
Hey, l know all about you.

620
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,700
Minor league junkballer. What did
you have, five seconds in the majors?

621
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,300
May work with the ladies,
but that crap doesn't work out here.

622
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,900
These kids need role models.

623
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,500
And you're not it.

624
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,000
Have a nice night, Ray.

625
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,200
Strike three!

626
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,400
Engelberg,
l got something special for you.

627
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,600
- lt's for power hitters.
- Thanks, coach.

628
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:33,000
<i>Now batting for the Bears,</i>
<i>number 20, Mike Engelberg.</i>

629
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,800
- What the hell is this?
- l don't know.

630
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,500
Buttermaker, what the hell
are you trying to pull?

631
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,600
Hey, it's a league bat, okay?

632
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,600
You're on thin ice, pal.
You try one more stunt like this again,

633
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,100
l'm gonna bounce you
out of the league.

634
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,400
Listen, Kevin, l don't think
it's gonna work out, buddy.

635
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,500
l still get paid though, right?

636
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,100
Well, sure. What do you think l am,
some asshole?

637
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,300
Here.

638
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,300
''Mombai''? You really went
all out for this one, didn't you?

639
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,700
lt's good enough to get your
little ass drunk for a month.

640
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,300
Now, come on, get out of here.
You're creeping the kids out.

641
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,700
Drop dead, asshole.

642
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,500
<i>And the final score:</i>
<i>Athletics, 9, Bears, nothing.</i>

643
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,300
Good job.

644
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,300
Kiss my ass. Kiss my ass.

645
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,700
Bitch.

646
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,600
Suck it.

647
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,100
What are you smiling at, Henry?

648
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,200
<i>Up the alley, down the street,</i>
<i>who's the toughest team to beat?</i>

649
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,000
<i>Bears! Bears! Yay, Bears!</i>

650
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,000
Hey, come on, guys.

651
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,900
Sit up straight, you look like
a bunch of hound dogs.

652
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,900
You got nothing to be ashamed of.

653
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,500
You got a few hits today.

654
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,200
You played all six innings.

655
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,500
- You ought to be proud of yourselves.
- Proud of what?

656
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,000
These things take time, guys.

657
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,800
- So does heart disease.
- And torture.

658
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,500
And physical therapy.

659
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,800
l did do some simple flowcharting
and data analysis.

660
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,100
And if you graph out our errors
and other parameters,

661
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,700
compared to the last game,

662
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,600
we've actually improved
by a considerable percentage.

663
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,200
Great.

664
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,200
We went from suck to stink.

665
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,100
See, that's the spirit.
We're getting better.

666
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,600
Now, Friday we play the Angels.

667
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,600
Now, what does that mean
for the Angels?

668
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,800
- Bad news for the Angels.
- You're damn right, it does.

669
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,200
Now, come on. Get off your asses,
and let's go get some hot dogs

670
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,700
and some Sunny D or whatever
the hell you guys drink these days.

671
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,900
Just leave me alone
will you, Buttermaker.

672
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,600
l'm too young to have a stalker.

673
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,100
Come on, Amanda,
just a few games, please?

674
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,800
l need to make money.

675
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,900
l need to buy clothes, makeup.
l'm saving up for a car.

676
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,900
You wear makeup?

677
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:29,900
What happened to
the Barbie oven with the muffin light?

678
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,700
That was like 20 years ago.
l'm all grown up now.

679
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,100
Yeah, you're probably right.

680
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,200
l'm sure your arm
sucks now, anyhow.

681
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,200
God, that is so lame.
Reverse psychology?

682
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,600
You're such a loser.
Man, you must have a big one,

683
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,800
because l don't know what else
my mom saw in you.

684
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,800
You're not supposed to be
talking about my-- My one.

685
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,500
You're 1 2 years old.

686
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,500
As far as you know,
l'm like G.l. Joe down there, okay?

687
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,600
l have the lnternet, you know.
l'm not stupid.

688
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,600
Just come play with us, will you?

689
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,700
lt'll be fun.

690
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,500
l'll pay for the clothes, okay?

691
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,500
And l'll help you out with the car

692
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,200
when it gets to that time.

693
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:19,500
- But you know, you just--
- No. Don't you get it? Just no.

694
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,800
All right,
l've been disappointed before.

695
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,100
All right, guys, listen up.

696
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,900
This is Amanda Whurlitzer.
She's your new pitcher.

697
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,500
A girl?

698
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,200
What's next, a cripple?

699
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,500
Oh, l forgot.

700
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,800
Dick.

701
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:14,200
Hey, ain't you ever heard
of ''throws like a girl''?

702
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,500
No, l never heard that.
Get a mitt, fat-ass.

703
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,000
l think l just entered puberty.

704
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,100
Come on, Amanda.

705
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,700
Strike three!

706
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:53,300
<i>Up next, number 1 8, Justin Cahill.</i>

707
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,500
He's out!

708
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,300
<i>Now batting for the Angels,</i>
<i>second baseman</i>

709
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,700
- <i>Yanek Goldanueva.</i>
- Hey, Hooper, check this out.

710
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,400
She's gonna come with a changeup,
l can tell.

711
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,900
She's psyching him out.

712
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,300
A changeup is when it looks
like it's gonna be a fastball,

713
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,400
but she takes a little off of it.

714
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,300
Strike three! You're out!

715
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,900
Ball four! Take your base.

716
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,000
Come on, somebody hit something.

717
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,300
<i>Next batter, Ahmad Abdul Rahim.</i>

718
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,000
Go!

719
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,700
Safe!

720
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,300
Ahmad.

721
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,800
Garo.

722

<i>Next up for the Bears,</i>
<i>Toby Whitewood.</i>

723
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,800
Toby.

724
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,600
Ball!

725
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,200
Watch this, Hooper.

726
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,200
The catcher's good.
Just good enough to get in trouble.

727
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,600
Strike one!

728
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,200
Run, run, run!

729
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,700
Safe!

730
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,300
Yes!

731
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:41,000
All right, way to go, guys. Way to go!
Good hustle!

732
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,800
They're playing ball now, man.
They're playing ball.

733
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,300
Ball four! Take your base.

734
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,800
Come on, guys! Let's hold them!

735
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,300
- <i>Number 28, Tyler Cohen.</i>
- Can't win if they don't score.

736
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,100
Way to go, Miguel!
Good catch, buddy!

737
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,700
Way to go!
We need two more, guys. Two more.

738
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,400
Strike three!

739
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,900
Come on, guys! Two out.

740
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,400
We need one more, Amanda.
Shut them down, honey.

741
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,200
Get under it! Get under it!

742
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,200
Throw it! Throw the ball! Hurry!

743
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,800
Safe!

744
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,400
What the hell is wrong
with you, dipshit?

745
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,200
Come on, guys, gather in.

746
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,900
Garo, that was nice hustle
out there today.

747
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,800
And, Jose, <i>muy bueno,</i> buddy.

748
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,600
Engelberg, you caught a hell
of a game. You all did good today.

749
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,100
Everyone except you,
you booger-eating moron.

750
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,200
Can't you catch one goddamn ball?

751
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,200
- Come on, Tanner.
- Even l could have caught that,

752
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,900
and look at me.

753
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,500
- Can't even move.
- Hey, guys, come on.

754
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,500
- Can't even move.
- Hey, guys, come on.

755
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,800
lt's like l told you before,
there's no ''l'' in team.

756
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
- Yeah, but there's an M and an E.
- There should be an F and a U.

757
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,800
Hey, hey. Don't fall apart at the seams
on me now. Come on, guys.

758
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,700
Remember how bad
we sucked two weeks ago?

759
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,200
They smelled that shit up in Fresno.

760
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,900
You almost won today.

761
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,400
Hold your heads up high.

762
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,600
Everybody in.

763
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,800
Let's go.

764
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,200
- Ready. One, two, three.
- Bears!

765
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,900
Good hit. That was a good one.
Choke up on your bat.

766
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,200
About that far, okay?

767
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,600
Put it back on your shoulder.
Back here.

768
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,300
There you go, all right?

769
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,500
Excellent. There you go.

770
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,000
Yes, sir. Good cut, honey.

771
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,400
Last pitch, guys!

772
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,400
All right, guys, let's bring it in!

773
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,800
Sister Sledge, that kid's got
an arm on him. Who is that?

774
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,500
That's Kelly Leak.

775
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:50,000
Yep, he's a real badass.

776
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,900
l heard he spent two years in juvie.

777
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,900
You don't know how old he is,
do you?

778
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:00,000
He's in our grade,
but he dates an eighth-grader.

779
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,600
Someone told me he got
a teacher pregnant.

780
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,100
l heard he broke some kid's arm
who owed him money.

781
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,100
Why, l heard he broke
both of his arms.

782
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,000
l heard he puts money under
your pillow when you lose a tooth.

783
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:15,200
- That's the tooth fairy, you homo.
- Actually, he only broke one arm.

784
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,800
The other was just a minor fracture
at the base of the humerus.

785
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,800
Who cares about that crap.
Can he play?

786
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,300
You kidding? You saw that arm.

787
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,500
l don't know, honey.

788
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,000
l'll be fine.

789
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,800
l don't like the looks of the place.
l mean, look at those creeps.

790
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,600
- l'll be fine. l'm cool.
- You sure?

791
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,400
- Yeah.
- You don't want me to go with you?

792
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,600
No, l'm good.

793
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,600
Listen, don't talk to anybody
but what's-his-ass.

794
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,400
l'll be fine.

795
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,000
Amanda?

796
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,800
- Shut up.
- Okay.

797
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:09,100
l bet l could do what you just did.
lt's easy.

798
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,100
- How much?
- l pull it off,

799
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,500
- you come play for the Bears.
- And if you don't?

800
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,400
Whatever you want.

801
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,000
Deal.

802
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
- Well, what happened?
- No deal.

803
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,200
No deal?

804
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,800
l thought you said you
were good at this.

805
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,800
l am. He's better.

806
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,900
See you later.

807
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,200
What does that mean?

808
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,400
''l'll see you later''?
l thought you said he was out.

809
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,700
He is. l just lost the bet, and now
l have to go out with him.

810
00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:00,200
You have to go out with him?
You mean out like ''out''?

811
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,700
You're 1 2.
There ain't no out when you're 1 2.

812
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:08,300
Calm down, Boilermaker.
lt's just a show with some stupid band.

813
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:12,100
l'm not a little girl anymore.
l had my period, all right.

814
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,900
Do you want me to have
a stroke or something?

815
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,600
Shut up. l'll be fine.

816
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,700
Well, l'm going
to the concert with you.

817
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,200
Whatever.
lt's just some dumb skate band.

818
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,000
- What the hell is a skate band?
- You know, a skate band.

819
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,300
The Bloodfarts.

820
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,500
Bloodfarts. The Bloodfarts?

821
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:34,800
Oh, l'm going with you.
Bet your ass on that.

822
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,500
No doubt. l'm going with you.

823
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,200
Strike three!

824
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,200
Strike three!

825
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,400
Strike three!

826
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,600
- Way to go, Amanda. Good game.
- Pitched a good game, Amanda.

827
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,500
No shit. Too bad we couldn't
even score one run.

828
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,500
Well, that's okay. We're doing better.

829
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,600
We tied, guys.

830
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:13,900
l know a tie's a lot like kissing your
sister, as my old coach used to say.

831
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,600
But the way we've been coming
along, it's more like kissing

832
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,200
a really hot stepsister,
or something like that, you know,

833
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,800
that you don't have
so much tied up in.

834
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:28,500
But anyway, l think-- l'm just saying,
pat yourselves on the back.

835
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:35,400
Stay focused.
l'll catch up with you guys.

836
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,100
Kelly, how you doing?

837
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,100
- Hey, coach.
- l haven't seen you around.

838
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,300
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing.

839
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:47,000
Wait. l have seen you around. We
haven't even talked since you pulled

840
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,800
that little Evel Knievel stunt
the other day out there, huh?

841
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,100
What's an ''Evel Knievel''?

842
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,400
Don't be a smart-ass. l could have
called the cops on you for that.

843
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:02,700
- Thanks, l'm real scared.
- No, l'm serious.

844
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:06,500
Vandalizing public property.
Disturbing the peace.

845
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:09,300
You're too young to be riding
that thing, you know.

846
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,200
You're just a kid.

847
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:16,900
Kelly, this field, it's for ball players.
lt's not for quitters.

848
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:22,100
lf it was for quitters,
it would be your field. But it's not.

849
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,600
l'd call your dad,
if anybody knew where he was.

850
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,600
- Listen, old man--
- Hey, now, you listen to me.

851
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,800
Nobody wants you around here,
all right?

852
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,700
Do you understand?

853
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,600
Do you think people like
seeing your nuts?

854
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,500
Hey, look who it is.

855
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:59,000
Yeah, it's the Bears' best player.

856
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,100
Hope you're not getting wet!

857
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:11,700
Nobody picks on him but me!

858
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,400
Let's go! Come on!

859
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,300
Yeah, that's right.
Run away, bitches!

860
00:59:31,305 --> 00:59:37,541
