00:00:20,903 --> 00:00:23,703
We begin tonight with
an environmental mystery.

3
00:00:23,703 --> 00:00:25,783
...debris along the beach
as far as the eye can see.

4
00:00:27,263 --> 00:00:29,183
A large fish kill has struck

5
00:00:29,183 --> 00:00:31,463
along the shoreline of the
Sebastian Inlet State Park.

6
00:00:31,463 --> 00:00:32,703
Biologists tell us there
were up to a million...

7
00:00:32,703 --> 00:00:34,343
She captured reams of dead fish

8
00:00:34,343 --> 00:00:35,423
rolling onshore
and piling up...

9
00:00:35,423 --> 00:00:37,503
Fishery staff are
baffled at what caused

10
00:00:37,503 --> 00:00:38,743
these hundreds of dead fish...

11
00:00:38,743 --> 00:00:40,983
Up to 5,000 blackbirds

12
00:00:40,983 --> 00:00:43,383
fell within
a one-mile area...

13
00:00:43,383 --> 00:00:45,983
Roughly two million...

14
00:00:45,983 --> 00:00:48,223
Dead fish on the shores
of Rio de Janeiro...

15
00:00:48,223 --> 00:00:50,743
Two million fish
here along Chesapeake Bay...

16
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:53,503
Thousands of birds started
falling from the sky...

17
00:00:57,663 --> 00:01:00,223
...investigation
is ongoing...

18
00:01:00,223 --> 00:01:01,423
They got me up 4:00
in the morning,

19
00:01:01,423 --> 00:01:03,103
told me we had birds
falling out of the sky.

20
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:05,503
Scientists don't
know what killed them.

21
00:01:15,103 --> 00:01:16,703
To your left...

22
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:18,023
look over to your left.

23
00:01:18,023 --> 00:01:20,543
Okay, you can see
that's where the footage

24
00:01:20,543 --> 00:01:23,223
about where you can,
uh, address...

25
00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:25,503
- what that was about, okay?
- Okay, sounds good.

26
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:28,983
Okay, why don't we start off?
If you could just

27
00:01:28,983 --> 00:01:30,343
fill us in
with basic details...

28
00:01:30,343 --> 00:01:32,263
Okay.

29
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:37,623
Uh, my name is Donna Thompson.

30
00:01:37,623 --> 00:01:39,743
I was a Communications major

31
00:01:39,743 --> 00:01:41,663
at American University

32
00:01:41,663 --> 00:01:44,023
covering the July 4th
festivities

33
00:01:44,023 --> 00:01:47,623
in Claridge, Maryland,
on July 4th, 2009.

34
00:01:47,623 --> 00:01:49,503
No cam... hey.

35
00:01:49,503 --> 00:01:51,983
This is the first time
I am speaking publicly

36
00:01:51,983 --> 00:01:53,623
about the disaster
that happened.

37
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:57,743
I was there.

38
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,183
Let's follow it.

39
00:02:04,823 --> 00:02:07,023
You okay, Donna?

40
00:02:07,023 --> 00:02:09,703
Donna?

41
00:02:09,703 --> 00:02:11,663
- Yeah.
- Okay?

42
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:14,103
- Are we gonna be all right?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

43
00:02:14,103 --> 00:02:16,103
I thought this was gonna be
a little easier to talk about.

44
00:02:18,983 --> 00:02:21,143
Okay, tell me when
you're ready and, um,

45
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:22,863
you can continue.

46
00:02:22,863 --> 00:02:25,023
- Okay.
- I know it's hard. Go ahead.

47
00:02:25,983 --> 00:02:28,543
Um...

48
00:02:28,543 --> 00:02:30,903
my name is Donna Thompson.

49
00:02:30,903 --> 00:02:33,023
For three years,
I and a few others

50
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:36,463
have been trying to speak out
about what happened

51
00:02:36,463 --> 00:02:37,703
in Claridge, Maryland,

52
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:40,463
on July 4th, 2009.

53
00:02:40,463 --> 00:02:43,943
But sometimes words
have no impact.

54
00:02:43,943 --> 00:02:46,703
But now, with the help
of a website

55
00:02:46,703 --> 00:02:48,063
called GovLeaks.org,

56
00:02:48,063 --> 00:02:50,143
all of the digital information

57
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:52,863
that was recorded that day
has been obtained.

58
00:02:53,823 --> 00:02:56,623
All of the digital information
that was confiscated.

59
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:59,663
Now, I don't know if anyone

60
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:01,423
is gonna be watching this.

61
00:03:01,423 --> 00:03:03,703
I don't know if anything
is gonna happen to me

62
00:03:03,703 --> 00:03:06,263
as a result of me
putting this out there,

63
00:03:06,263 --> 00:03:08,863
but I do know that

64
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:11,383
I can't move on with my life

65
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:14,743
until this story is told.

66
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,823
You know, it's just, um...

67
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,703
it's hard to explain
what this town used to be like.

68
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:23,503
Well, it's 6:00
in the morning

69
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:26,223
with "Mike in the Morning"
on this beautiful day,

70
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:27,503
this Day of Independence.

71
00:03:27,503 --> 00:03:30,343
Good morning, Chesapeake,
and good morning, America.

72
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,543
Listen, I'm your marathon man.

73
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:34,143
What does that mean?

74
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:36,023
Hopefully you're gonna be
with me day and night

75
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:37,983
as I am with you
and we can celebrate.

76
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:39,823
I can't think
of a better way to celebrate

77
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:41,823
than a little music
from the heartland.

78
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:44,863
I used to
come here every summer

79
00:03:44,863 --> 00:03:46,623
with my folks.

80
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:49,383
It's hard to explain what
this town used to be like.

81
00:03:49,383 --> 00:03:51,383
I mean, it was fun.

82
00:03:51,383 --> 00:03:54,623
It was where I had
my first crab dinner,

83
00:03:54,623 --> 00:03:55,943
my first summer kiss.

84
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,383
So, uh, that's the mayor
right there.

85
00:04:00,383 --> 00:04:02,103
Mayor John Stockman.

86
00:04:02,103 --> 00:04:04,623
He actually used to run
a vacuum cleaner shop,

87
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:06,623
and then one day he just
up and got everyone

88
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:07,463
to vote for him for mayor.

89
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:12,383
Right there, that's Martin
and Helen Wycoff.

90
00:04:12,383 --> 00:04:15,223
They were both involved in a lot
of community service programs.

91
00:04:15,223 --> 00:04:19,183
Um, their whole family
actually died that day.

92
00:04:19,183 --> 00:04:21,103
Three, two, one.

93
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:22,463
Good morning, Maryland.

94
00:04:24,383 --> 00:04:27,623
- Oh, wait. Sorry.
- It's okay.

95
00:04:27,623 --> 00:04:29,743
Honestly,
why didn't anyone tell me

96
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:31,623
my pants were too tight?

97
00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:34,663
I'm sorry. It's just that every
time I look at this footage,

98
00:04:34,663 --> 00:04:36,503
it's...

99
00:04:36,503 --> 00:04:39,063
it's a little difficult,
and I have this tendency

100
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:41,023
to overcompensate a little bit.

101
00:04:41,023 --> 00:04:45,063
- So...
- So you use humor, uh,

102
00:04:45,063 --> 00:04:47,103
to hide those emotions.

103
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:49,303
- I understand.
- Right.

104
00:04:49,303 --> 00:04:50,783
I mean, maybe
you should've gotten

105
00:04:50,783 --> 00:04:52,823
a voice actor
or something to do this.

106
00:04:52,823 --> 00:04:54,103
I don't know.

107
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:55,583
Okay, okay.
I gotta stop this.

108
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,503
I've been getting
too many phone calls,

109
00:04:57,503 --> 00:04:58,583
too many complaints.

110
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,463
For those of you who do care,

111
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:02,143
it is Aaron Copland.

112
00:05:02,143 --> 00:05:03,743
That's a piece
from "Our Town."

113
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:06,183
What do you say we kick
the energy up a little bit, huh?

114
00:05:06,183 --> 00:05:08,183
I was just a summer intern.

115
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,943
I was just so excited
I was gonna be

116
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,263
actually interviewing people.

117
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:15,103
I think it's every girl's dream
to be Miss Crustacean.

118
00:05:16,063 --> 00:05:18,703
I hope it's the beginning
of something much, much bigger.

119
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:20,903
I want to thank my parents
for their support

120
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,783
and my sister Taylor
for always being there for me.

121
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:26,303
Good morning, Maryland.

122
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:29,303
This is Donna Thompson,
and I'm in Claridge, Maryland.

123
00:05:29,303 --> 00:05:31,103
Claridge is the host
of our annual

124
00:05:31,103 --> 00:05:33,263
Eastern Chesapeake
July 4th party.

125
00:05:33,263 --> 00:05:35,423
And I will be here all day
to cover the events.

126
00:05:35,423 --> 00:05:38,783
It is my great pleasure
to announce

127
00:05:38,783 --> 00:05:42,823
the beginning
of the 57th Annual

128
00:05:42,823 --> 00:05:46,343
Claridge Crab Eating
Spectacular.

129
00:05:47,823 --> 00:05:48,703
Am I in the frame?

130
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,583
So, this is good old Claridge.

131
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,503
It was founded in 1903,

132
00:05:57,503 --> 00:05:59,943
supposedly by a fisherman
who ran around here

133
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,663
and liked it so much that
he started a crab restaurant.

134
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,463
- What's your name?
- Tyler.

135
00:06:04,463 --> 00:06:06,503
And have you been preparing
for a while for this?

136
00:06:06,503 --> 00:06:07,743
Not very.

137
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:10,383
All of it is, or was,

138
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:12,663
a whole population of 6,200.

139
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,463
There's a pretty big
chicken industry,

140
00:06:15,463 --> 00:06:17,143
a bunch of restaurants,

141
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,863
and a whole lot of money
is made from summer tourism

142
00:06:19,863 --> 00:06:21,143
on the water here.

143
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:25,703
Good job! Who's next?
Who's next?

144
00:06:25,703 --> 00:06:28,583
- Me! Me! Me!
- I wanna get dunked.

145
00:06:31,463 --> 00:06:34,463
♪ Who's been playin'
around with you? ♪

146
00:06:34,463 --> 00:06:37,343
♪ A real cool cat
with eyes of blue... ♪

147
00:06:39,263 --> 00:06:41,983
Oh, God. This
is my first interview ever

148
00:06:41,983 --> 00:06:43,583
with Mayor Stockman.

149
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,743
I think I made him do this interview
like four different times.

150
00:06:46,743 --> 00:06:48,703
I think I even told him
his hair dried fast

151
00:06:48,703 --> 00:06:49,983
because he's bald.

152
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:52,983
Yep, it does dry fast, yeah.

153
00:06:52,983 --> 00:06:55,463
So, I think we can show
just about everybody

154
00:06:55,463 --> 00:06:57,743
that comes on down
a really good time.

155
00:06:57,743 --> 00:06:59,903
Yeah. Cool.

156
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:00,863
Of course, at the time,

157
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,423
I had no idea
how culpable he was

158
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,143
for what was about to happen.

159
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:12,063
The first signs
that something was very wrong

160
00:07:12,063 --> 00:07:15,103
happened six weeks
before July 4th.

161
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:17,663
It was on the news,
but I don't think anybody

162
00:07:17,663 --> 00:07:18,903
really put two and two together

163
00:07:18,903 --> 00:07:21,343
and knew what was going on.

164
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,303
The bodies of
two scientists were found

165
00:07:23,303 --> 00:07:25,183
in the Chesapeake Bay
last night after having been

166
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,583
reported missing
for more than 36 hours.

167
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,143
The cause of death
was listed as unknown,

168
00:07:30,143 --> 00:07:32,863
although medical examiners found
numerous wounds on the body

169
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,983
that might be consistent
with shark bites.

170
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:36,863
The two scientists
were oceanographers

171
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:40,143
working to measure
pollution levels in the bay.

172
00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:42,703
These were two oceanographers.

173
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:45,023
One from the Cousteau Institute

174
00:07:45,023 --> 00:07:47,823
and another from
the University of Maryland.

175
00:07:47,823 --> 00:07:50,743
They were keeping a video diary
of their research

176
00:07:50,743 --> 00:07:54,343
and sending it to the Chesapeake
Environmental Council.

177
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:57,943
Red algae here and here

178
00:07:57,943 --> 00:07:59,103
does indicate bacterial growth.

179
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,823
Now Natural Resources,

180
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:04,063
they think it's feeding off
the nutrients in the water

181
00:08:04,063 --> 00:08:05,903
from the chicken runoff.

182
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,823
- That's a strange attack.
- Yes, it is.

183
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:10,303
You don't hear about shark
attacks in the bay, normally.

184
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:12,263
Well, I think bull
sharks can be aggressive.

185
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:13,543
It seems like I remember, what,

186
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:16,143
- a couple of attacks last year, maybe?
- Here and there.

187
00:08:16,143 --> 00:08:18,343
- Yeah.
- It is brackish throughout the Chesapeake Bay

188
00:08:18,343 --> 00:08:19,863
and bull sharks have been known

189
00:08:19,863 --> 00:08:21,263
to come up
in the bay occasionally.

190
00:08:21,263 --> 00:08:23,943
I gotta tell ya.
It makes me a little nervous.

191
00:08:23,943 --> 00:08:27,263
We have a boat and go out
in the bay all the time.

192
00:08:27,263 --> 00:08:29,783
They got the results
on the water analysis.

193
00:08:29,783 --> 00:08:31,543
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

194
00:08:32,503 --> 00:08:34,303
What do you have?

195
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,343
Uh, mercury levels
way above standards,

196
00:08:36,343 --> 00:08:38,503
polycyclic acids, OPs,

197
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:41,143
PCBs that haven't
been legal in 20 years.

198
00:08:41,143 --> 00:08:44,063
Endocrine disruptors, pharmaceuticals,

199
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:46,143
Viagra, estrogen, DDT,

200
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:47,863
- trace amounts of GRDF.
- Phew.

201
00:08:47,863 --> 00:08:50,583
I mean, pretty much
you name it,

202
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,183
it's in there.

203
00:08:57,943 --> 00:08:58,783
I mean, looky here.

204
00:09:01,663 --> 00:09:03,543
Naw.

205
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,983
This whole stream
of toxin is following the current.

206
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:07,463
The what's following the what?

207
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,023
- You have a very thick accent sometimes.
- Sam.

208
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:13,863
This whole stream of toxin
is following the current.

209
00:09:13,863 --> 00:09:15,983
- Yes.
- Look. It's going next to this little town.

210
00:09:15,983 --> 00:09:17,423
Claridge.

211
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,983
Claridge.

212
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:22,343
There were
people who were concerned

213
00:09:22,343 --> 00:09:23,583
about what was going on
in the bay.

214
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,543
With some of the townsfolk,
it did cause arguments.

215
00:09:26,543 --> 00:09:30,023
Your chicken plants are putting
chicken shit in my bay...

216
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:31,143
...and they're killing.

217
00:09:31,143 --> 00:09:32,943
The important thing, Jerry...

218
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:35,303
Jerry? The important
thing to understand

219
00:09:35,303 --> 00:09:38,663
is that the EPA continues
to test the bay.

220
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:40,223
And it is really...

221
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:43,343
it's really their responsibility.
It's their responsibility.

222
00:09:47,183 --> 00:09:49,183
Each one of these sheds has

223
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:52,383
approximately 32,000
chickens in it each.

224
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,943
Those chickens eat about
10,000 pounds worth of food.

225
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:58,823
They do this all
very mathematically.

226
00:09:58,823 --> 00:10:01,583
You know, I don't care what
people say about the bay.

227
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:02,623
I know it looks
a little different,

228
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,463
but all our kids have grown up

229
00:10:05,463 --> 00:10:07,023
in the water in the bay.

230
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,463
So I don't know what all
the doom and gloom

231
00:10:08,463 --> 00:10:10,303
is all about.

232
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,383
There's 45 million
pounds of chicken shit

233
00:10:13,343 --> 00:10:15,143
dumped into the bay each year.

234
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:16,703
I mean, look at that.

235
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,903
That is entirely chicken shit.

236
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:22,103
And over here.

237
00:10:22,103 --> 00:10:24,383
Look how close we are
to the water.

238
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,543
It's right there.

239
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:30,103
Chicken shit.
Water.

240
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:31,903
We gotta have
improvement in the economy.

241
00:10:31,903 --> 00:10:33,383
We got to develop.

242
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,223
I say we develop
the hell out of the bay.

243
00:10:35,223 --> 00:10:36,703
And then we can pay
to clean it up.

244
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:40,023
You know, a lot of people...

245
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:42,263
a lot of people...
gave me a hard time

246
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:44,263
when we put up
the desalination plant.

247
00:10:44,263 --> 00:10:46,143
With that desalination plant,

248
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,103
we increased the capacity

249
00:10:48,103 --> 00:10:49,983
for poultry farming
in the area.

250
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,743
The desalination plant

251
00:10:51,743 --> 00:10:52,703
filtered water from the bay

252
00:10:53,663 --> 00:10:55,343
so that people could drink it

253
00:10:55,343 --> 00:10:57,423
and use it
for the chicken industry.

254
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,303
And everyone just assumed

255
00:10:59,303 --> 00:11:02,063
it would take anything
harmful out of the water.

256
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:04,143
Your lawns benefit from that.

257
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:06,463
We have pools
that are in operation.

258
00:11:06,463 --> 00:11:08,463
And last but not least,

259
00:11:08,463 --> 00:11:10,263
I don't know about you,

260
00:11:10,263 --> 00:11:13,703
but I think this is
the best darn water

261
00:11:13,703 --> 00:11:15,103
I've ever tasted.

262
00:11:18,463 --> 00:11:21,303
People were worried
about the economy and the water,

263
00:11:21,303 --> 00:11:23,183
but mostly that
wasn't their focus.

264
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,103
They were just doing
the American thing.

265
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,983
You know, trying
to make a living,

266
00:11:27,983 --> 00:11:30,623
dealing with their children,
enjoying their lives.

267
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,543
And everything seemed

268
00:11:32,543 --> 00:11:34,263
really pretty good.

269
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,743
Someone do something.

270
00:11:44,743 --> 00:11:45,423
Do something!

271
00:11:49,183 --> 00:11:51,263
What's going on?

272
00:11:51,263 --> 00:11:52,623
Mommy!

273
00:11:56,503 --> 00:11:58,183
- What's going on?
- What happened?

274
00:12:01,063 --> 00:12:03,063
Oh, my God.

275
00:12:03,063 --> 00:12:04,943
Has anyone seen my husband?

276
00:12:04,943 --> 00:12:06,743
What's happening to me?

277
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:08,383
Please help me.

278
00:12:08,383 --> 00:12:09,983
I need my husband

279
00:12:09,983 --> 00:12:11,743
and my kids.

280
00:12:11,743 --> 00:12:13,663
I need to go to the hospital.

281
00:12:13,663 --> 00:12:16,383
Someone needs to get me
to the hospital.

282
00:12:16,383 --> 00:12:18,063
Almost done.
We should have a report

283
00:12:18,063 --> 00:12:20,183
of who the winner is shortly.

284
00:12:20,183 --> 00:12:22,103
I need to go to the hospital.

285
00:12:22,103 --> 00:12:24,863
Someone needs to get me
to the hospital.

286
00:12:24,863 --> 00:12:27,663
I've never seen
anything like that.

287
00:12:32,023 --> 00:12:32,983
Ohh.

288
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:34,903
Ooh, are you getting that?
Are you getting that?

289
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:36,543
He just vomited.
Are you getting that?

290
00:12:38,623 --> 00:12:40,343
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my God.

291
00:12:44,183 --> 00:12:46,983
It's okay... miss, cut
the cameras, please.

292
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:48,343
It's all right, Tiffany. You're
almost done, sweetheart.

293
00:12:54,103 --> 00:12:55,703
Danny, where are you?

294
00:12:55,703 --> 00:12:56,943
This is a lens cap?

295
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,543
- Am I in frame?
- Mm.

296
00:12:59,543 --> 00:13:01,743
This is Dr. Jack Abrams.

297
00:13:01,743 --> 00:13:05,503
He was the head physician
in the emergency waiting room

298
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:07,583
at Atlantic Hospital.

299
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:11,383
He would actually end up
treating over 350 patients

300
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:13,223
over the course of that day.

301
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:16,743
And he would die
later that night.

302
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:18,423
Could you take
off your shirt, please?

303
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:28,063
Just... can you... turn around
a little bit more?

304
00:13:28,063 --> 00:13:29,983
I'm just gonna point
this out to the camera.

305
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,063
CDC. Is this an emergency?

306
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:34,023
- Yes, it is.
- Are you a health professional?

307
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:36,823
- A doctor.
- Okay. Hold, please.

308
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:37,663
- Emergency operations.
- Yeah, hi.

309
00:13:38,623 --> 00:13:39,983
This is Dr. Jack Abrams
over at the Atlantic Hospital

310
00:13:39,983 --> 00:13:41,983
in Claridge, Maryland.

311
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:45,823
- How can we help you today?
- We're in the middle of some kind of bacterial outbreak.

312
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,823
This is Dr. Williams
in Communicable Disease.

313
00:13:49,823 --> 00:13:51,983
Uh, you believe you may
have a bacterial case?

314
00:13:51,983 --> 00:13:54,303
Uh, not one. 30.

315
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,543
What?

316
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,823
I got 30 people
in the waiting room

317
00:13:57,823 --> 00:14:01,023
- at my hospital right now.
- What are the symptoms?

318
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:03,623
The entire group has broken out
in blisters, boils, lesions...

319
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:07,583
- Where?
- Face, legs, neck, chest.

320
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,423
I got a woman whose entire
backside is covered in boils.

321
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:13,543
- All right. When did this begin?
- This morning.

322
00:14:13,543 --> 00:14:15,543
Today.

323
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:16,983
What do you think it is?

324
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:18,463
I have no idea what it is.

325
00:14:18,463 --> 00:14:19,703
All right.

326
00:14:19,703 --> 00:14:22,303
I'm gonna walk you through a
list of associated symptoms.

327
00:14:22,303 --> 00:14:24,343
Okay.
Okay.

328
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:25,943
I'm gonna ask you
a couple more questions.

329
00:14:25,943 --> 00:14:28,143
You been around any livestock?
Agriculture?

330
00:14:28,143 --> 00:14:29,703
- No.
- Farm animals?

331
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,943
You spend a lot of time
in the sun?

332
00:14:30,943 --> 00:14:32,543
No, not really.

333
00:14:32,543 --> 00:14:33,943
More than usual?
Less than usual? Same?

334
00:14:33,943 --> 00:14:35,583
Not really.

335
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,703
You know, it hurts

336
00:14:37,703 --> 00:14:38,983
just in my bones.

337
00:14:38,983 --> 00:14:41,463
What concerns me is we've had
a lot of people in today

338
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,063
who've had similar
symptoms to that.

339
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:46,303
Frankly, that's why
we're doing this.

340
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,223
If you wouldn't mind just
looking right into the lens

341
00:14:48,223 --> 00:14:49,983
and saying your name?

342
00:14:49,983 --> 00:14:53,503
- My name is Lamya Jezek.
- Great.

343
00:14:53,503 --> 00:14:54,823
What am I supposed to say?

344
00:14:54,823 --> 00:14:55,903
Oh, no.
You're fine.

345
00:14:55,903 --> 00:14:57,903
I'm gonna ask you
a couple questions.

346
00:14:57,903 --> 00:14:58,983
Okay.

347
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:00,783
I didn't know
it was a big deal.

348
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:02,623
I'm just asking to go
through a drive-through.

349
00:15:02,623 --> 00:15:05,583
You're insane.
You do this every day.

350
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,983
- Okay, Grandma. Okay.
- It's like clockwork.

351
00:15:06,983 --> 00:15:09,423
I'm sorry. Grab the
food, you're out.

352
00:15:09,423 --> 00:15:10,863
That's why it's
a drive-through.

353
00:15:10,863 --> 00:15:12,943
It's not a big deal.
Just go through.

354
00:15:12,943 --> 00:15:14,183
Can you do it?

355
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:16,023
This is Officer Paul.

356
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:17,783
He's the one on the left.

357
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,063
He was actually the best man
at Officer Jimson's wedding.

358
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,983
What is that?

359
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:25,343
- What is that?
- They reported the first death

360
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:29,503
in Claridge
at 12:42 PM.

361
00:15:29,503 --> 00:15:32,503
Is he shot?

362
00:15:32,503 --> 00:15:34,263
Check his pulse.

363
00:15:34,263 --> 00:15:36,223
Oh, gosh.
I don't wanna do that.

364
00:15:38,903 --> 00:15:41,103
He's dead.

365
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:43,903
I don't see any
bullet holes, though.

366
00:15:43,903 --> 00:15:46,623
All right. Central,
this is SM 10-12.

367
00:15:46,623 --> 00:15:47,623
We got a young white male

368
00:15:47,623 --> 00:15:49,663
laid out on the corner of, uh,

369
00:15:49,663 --> 00:15:51,543
Center and Hyde.

370
00:15:51,543 --> 00:15:53,143
He's dead.

371
00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:55,943
Go ahead and dispatch
EMS as soon as you can.

372
00:15:55,943 --> 00:15:58,023
Is there anyone around?

373
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:11,743
- Hi.
- Hey.

374
00:16:11,743 --> 00:16:13,183
- Huh?
- Whoo.

375
00:16:13,183 --> 00:16:14,623
What do you think, Andrew?

376
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:16,223
Oh, you like that foot.

377
00:16:16,223 --> 00:16:18,863
We're gonna go to Claridge,
see the fireworks, huh?

378
00:16:18,863 --> 00:16:20,503
Do you know what fireworks are?

379
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:22,423
This is Alex

380
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:24,823
and Stephanie Talmet.

381
00:16:24,823 --> 00:16:27,783
He was a very young,

382
00:16:27,783 --> 00:16:30,583
very successful dentist
from Townsend.

383
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:33,343
And Stephanie,
she grew up in Claridge

384
00:16:33,343 --> 00:16:36,383
before becoming a big-shot
lawyer in Baltimore.

385
00:16:36,383 --> 00:16:38,303
We're gonna call them later
and they're gonna meet us there.

386
00:16:38,303 --> 00:16:40,983
- That's their baby.
- You sure? They're gonna meet us?

387
00:16:41,023 --> 00:16:43,383
They rented
a boat in Wilmington

388
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:46,183
to sail to Claridge
for the fireworks.

389
00:16:46,183 --> 00:16:47,583
And that's why they
were headed this way.

390
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,903
All right. We're gonna
get this motorboat going.

391
00:16:50,903 --> 00:16:52,223
We ready for this?

392
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,263
Where are you, ma'am?

393
00:17:08,263 --> 00:17:10,303
My God. She's bleeding.

394
00:17:10,303 --> 00:17:14,023
Ma'am?

395
00:17:14,023 --> 00:17:15,543
I just got my camera.

396
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,983
She just ran out
into the yard, and...

397
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:19,543
Can you tell me what
your address is right now?

398
00:17:19,543 --> 00:17:21,623
I'm in my home, I'm in my home.

399
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:25,463
And what
street is your home on?

400
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,503
She's bleeding. You
gotta send somebody, please.

401
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:30,303
Where is she bleeding from?

402
00:17:30,303 --> 00:17:32,223
Just send help.
Send somebody now.

403
00:17:32,223 --> 00:17:34,303
Send somebody quick.
Please.

404
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,703
114 Maple St.

405
00:17:40,063 --> 00:17:41,663
Donna? Donna?

406
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:44,063
Hey, Donna.
Come here.

407
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,223
Did anyone tell you
what this was?

408
00:17:48,223 --> 00:17:49,503
Do you know who's in there?

409
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:51,663
All right.
Let's go.

410
00:17:51,663 --> 00:17:53,183
Let's follow it.

411
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:58,143
Hey, we got a situation
over at the 9-1-1 Call Center.

412
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,623
And the system's
about to go down.

413
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:04,863
We're just overloaded
with calls.

414
00:18:04,863 --> 00:18:06,863
Atlantic Hospital's
overcrowded.

415
00:18:06,863 --> 00:18:09,503
75 at St. Alban's Clinic.

416
00:18:09,503 --> 00:18:12,623
Clinic on Dorsey? Check out all
those people out on the curb.

417
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:14,703
Some sort of killer virus,
they say.

418
00:18:14,703 --> 00:18:17,903
You know?
So, wash your hands

419
00:18:17,903 --> 00:18:20,383
and keep your gloves on
and whatnot.

420
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:26,943
I need you to
respond from the west side.

421
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,463
Come up to Prince Street

422
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:31,903
and stop short
of St. James

423
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:35,543
and check back
to the south side.

424
00:18:35,543 --> 00:18:39,063
That's the one showing the body
was laying behind the yard.

425
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:41,343
At the address
123 St. James.

426
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:43,823
Hey, John.

427
00:18:47,663 --> 00:18:49,263
Whew. Marla Spatafora.

428
00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:50,903
She got it bad.

429
00:18:50,903 --> 00:18:53,503
I mean, somebody
really tore into her.

430
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:56,783
Bill and I found her
over on the lawn.

431
00:18:57,743 --> 00:19:00,183
Her guts were tore out.

432
00:19:00,183 --> 00:19:02,583
- And her tongue cut off.
- Her tongue was cut off?

433
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,343
Yeah.

434
00:19:04,383 --> 00:19:05,983
I imagine it's a domestic.

435
00:19:05,983 --> 00:19:07,263
Do we know anything
about the husband?

436
00:19:07,263 --> 00:19:08,903
A Jason Spatafora?

437
00:19:08,903 --> 00:19:10,783
I am at the scene
of the crime right now

438
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:13,023
with a man named Jerry.

439
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,783
He's a fisherman in the town.

440
00:19:14,783 --> 00:19:18,823
And, um, you knew
Ms. Sporafina, is that correct?

441
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:20,663
Spatafora.

442
00:19:20,663 --> 00:19:21,983
I apologize.

443
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,463
They... they sent us
the wrong name.

444
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:28,983
She was a wonderful woman.
Very calm, very quiet.

445
00:19:29,023 --> 00:19:31,103
Does this go on
in the town a lot?

446
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,103
Domestic violence cases?

447
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:34,983
- It just seems...
- I'm sorry, what?

448
00:19:34,983 --> 00:19:37,263
Try it... do
that one more time.

449
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:39,903
I thought I was
following a murder story.

450
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,063
I was just going through
the motions,

451
00:19:43,023 --> 00:19:45,343
almost trying to imitate
what I thought a reporter

452
00:19:45,343 --> 00:19:46,623
should sound like.

453
00:19:46,623 --> 00:19:48,543
No.

454
00:19:50,463 --> 00:19:53,103
Makes me cringe
when I watch this now.

455
00:19:53,103 --> 00:19:56,223
- All right, just do an ending...
- God, I feel bad.

456
00:19:58,143 --> 00:19:59,823
I didn't seem too pushy, did I?

457
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:00,823
No, no, no.

458
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,703
I don't know.
It's weird.

459
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,623
You have to, like, pretend
you don't feel anything

460
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:10,503
about the situation
when you're a reporter.

461
00:20:10,503 --> 00:20:14,143
But it's...
no, you did a good job.

462
00:20:14,143 --> 00:20:16,383
You weren't overly emotional
and you weren't too...

463
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,543
too much of a reporter
with him. It was good.

464
00:20:18,503 --> 00:20:20,823
- It was a good conversation.
- All right.

465
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:25,023
Hey, hey.

466
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,823
Are you excited?

467
00:20:26,823 --> 00:20:28,983
We're gonna go and
see Grandma and Grandpa.

468
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:31,703
Yeah.

469
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:35,183
Very exciting.

470
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:38,423
You know what? We're not gonna say
anything about Grandma's hair.

471
00:20:38,463 --> 00:20:40,343
Where did he go?

472
00:20:40,343 --> 00:20:43,063
Where's Daddy?

473
00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:46,063
Oh, look at this.

474
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:49,823
I need you to look
at this, okay?

475
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:53,943
Just... just look at this.

476
00:20:53,943 --> 00:20:55,703
It's like some kind of

477
00:20:55,743 --> 00:20:57,343
blister or something.

478
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:58,783
This girl... Jennifer...

479
00:20:58,783 --> 00:21:01,263
she was using FaceTime
with her phone

480
00:21:01,263 --> 00:21:04,503
to show a rash that suddenly
broke out on her body.

481
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:06,183
- This stuff on my arms...
- Oh, my God, Jennifer.

482
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:07,423
- That's disgusting.
- Look at my leg.

483
00:21:07,423 --> 00:21:09,343
When we looked at
her phone call list,

484
00:21:09,343 --> 00:21:11,383
it turns out she was trying
to stay in contact

485
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:13,623
with her friend
throughout the entire day.

486
00:21:13,623 --> 00:21:15,063
I can't get anyone
on the phone.

487
00:21:15,063 --> 00:21:16,943
- Did you put something on it?
- Nobody's answering.

488
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,743
It just goes straight
to voicemail.

489
00:21:18,783 --> 00:21:20,463
I know. Service
is sucking ass.

490
00:21:20,463 --> 00:21:22,783
Every time I watch
these FaceTime videos,

491
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:25,503
it makes me feel sad.

492
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:28,983
My parents left
like an hour ago.

493
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:30,343
I don't even know
where they were going.

494
00:21:30,343 --> 00:21:32,063
They didn't even tell me
they were leaving.

495
00:21:32,063 --> 00:21:33,823
They were just out the door

496
00:21:33,823 --> 00:21:35,343
and they pulled out
before I had a chance

497
00:21:35,343 --> 00:21:36,903
to even say goodbye

498
00:21:36,903 --> 00:21:38,783
or ask them where
they were going.

499
00:21:38,783 --> 00:21:41,703
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah, it does really hurt.

500
00:21:42,663 --> 00:21:43,943
Is this gonna be okay
for the audio?

501
00:21:43,943 --> 00:21:45,543
- Yeah.
- The rain on the...

502
00:21:45,543 --> 00:21:47,263
- I think it's okay.
- I'll speak loudly.

503
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,423
Um, okay. Hello.

504
00:21:50,463 --> 00:21:52,423
That was very formal.

505
00:21:52,423 --> 00:21:55,823
Okay, we have now seen
one infected fish.

506
00:21:55,823 --> 00:21:56,863
And we are going
to be using this

507
00:21:58,783 --> 00:22:00,903
borescope... hello...

508
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,703
to go inside the fish's mouth

509
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:04,463
and see if it was
an isolated incident or not.

510
00:22:06,383 --> 00:22:07,423
Come with me.

511
00:22:10,303 --> 00:22:11,423
Inside.

512
00:22:14,303 --> 00:22:16,303
Okay, secure.

513
00:22:20,143 --> 00:22:22,863
And okay.

514
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:24,903
This, everyone,

515
00:22:24,903 --> 00:22:26,983
is parasite larvae.

516
00:22:26,983 --> 00:22:28,063
Ew.

517
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:31,903
Explain for them.

518
00:22:31,903 --> 00:22:33,863
Uh, well,

519
00:22:33,863 --> 00:22:36,423
a parasite larvae,
it's, uh... it's a creature

520
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:39,103
whose eggs are
swallowed by fish

521
00:22:39,103 --> 00:22:41,583
and then they hatch
inside the belly.

522
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,263
It's fun stuff.

523
00:22:43,263 --> 00:22:45,503
I've never really seen
larvae like this, though.

524
00:22:45,503 --> 00:22:46,983
I don't know where
the parasites are coming from.

525
00:22:55,623 --> 00:22:56,863
What'd he say?

526
00:22:56,863 --> 00:22:58,423
I just heard on the car radio

527
00:22:58,463 --> 00:22:59,623
that there was another murder.

528
00:22:59,623 --> 00:23:01,623
- A second murder?
- Yes.

529
00:23:01,623 --> 00:23:03,263
Only 12 blocks from the murder

530
00:23:03,263 --> 00:23:05,143
of Marla Spatafora
this afternoon.

531
00:23:05,143 --> 00:23:06,463
And now authorities
are telling us

532
00:23:06,463 --> 00:23:07,983
the body was found in a rather

533
00:23:07,983 --> 00:23:09,503
mutilated condition.

534
00:23:09,503 --> 00:23:11,063
And I believe police believe

535
00:23:11,063 --> 00:23:12,823
that the husband could
be involved in this.

536
00:23:12,863 --> 00:23:14,103
That's what we're hearing.

537
00:23:14,103 --> 00:23:14,983
Some reports, perhaps,
of a history of abuse there.

538
00:23:15,943 --> 00:23:17,183
Or some allegations,
at least, of abuse.

539
00:23:17,183 --> 00:23:19,463
You can follow
her throughout the day

540
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:24,383
by going to
www.wvbr33news.com.

541
00:23:24,383 --> 00:23:26,583
- Uh, sir. Channel 33...
- You are pushing your luck.

542
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,223
This could be
a career-maker for her.

543
00:23:28,223 --> 00:23:30,023
- What are the odds?
- Unbelievable.

544
00:23:30,023 --> 00:23:31,863
- Unbelievable.
- Is she gonna be able to handle this?

545
00:23:31,863 --> 00:23:33,943
I just had to show you
these off-air comments.

546
00:23:33,943 --> 00:23:36,263
I mean, they're wondering
if I can handle this

547
00:23:36,263 --> 00:23:40,063
and they're right.
I'm chasing a murder mystery.

548
00:23:40,063 --> 00:23:42,943
- A small town celebration.
- Yeah. We're gonna do the parade.

549
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:45,743
- I'm from American University...
- You're out from college?

550
00:23:45,743 --> 00:23:47,703
That's it, guys.
Off the property.

551
00:23:47,743 --> 00:23:49,623
I wasn't asking
the right questions, and...

552
00:23:49,623 --> 00:23:52,943
Now she's covering what's gonna
be the biggest story of the year.

553
00:23:52,943 --> 00:23:53,983
It could be huge.
Could be huge.

554
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:55,423
Sir, we do have press passes.

555
00:23:55,423 --> 00:23:57,823
- Press passes...
- Oh, my God.

556
00:23:57,823 --> 00:23:59,423
Oh, my God.

557
00:23:59,423 --> 00:24:01,263
Looking back,
I just don't understand

558
00:24:01,263 --> 00:24:03,543
how I still thought
it was a murder case.

559
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:05,183
Jim, are you getting it?

560
00:24:05,183 --> 00:24:07,103
I can only assume

561
00:24:07,103 --> 00:24:09,423
that whatever this is
is going to continue

562
00:24:09,423 --> 00:24:11,743
to eat away at the leg
and at the knee

563
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:13,343
and probably move
to the upper body

564
00:24:13,343 --> 00:24:15,023
and into the gonads.

565
00:24:15,023 --> 00:24:17,143
I think that what we're
talking about here

566
00:24:17,183 --> 00:24:19,423
are two separate strains
of some kind of parasite.

567
00:24:21,343 --> 00:24:23,783
Something that is
literally eating its way

568
00:24:23,783 --> 00:24:25,783
into the body from the outside.

569
00:24:26,743 --> 00:24:28,503
Uh, there are lesions

570
00:24:28,543 --> 00:24:30,383
and there's boils

571
00:24:30,383 --> 00:24:31,823
and also there's something

572
00:24:31,823 --> 00:24:34,743
eating its way out from inside.

573
00:24:34,743 --> 00:24:36,463
What I need you to do

574
00:24:36,463 --> 00:24:38,303
is figure out
what the hell this is.

575
00:24:40,223 --> 00:24:42,343
John, what is going on?

576
00:24:42,343 --> 00:24:43,943
Oh, man. You know...

577
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:45,183
- We've never had murders...
- Well, you know...

578
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,703
...reported here
in the city.

579
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:48,223
You know, actually, um...

580
00:24:48,223 --> 00:24:49,983
I've been so busy

581
00:24:49,983 --> 00:24:52,183
with the reelection
and July 4th.

582
00:24:52,183 --> 00:24:53,863
I mean, the sheriff
office is...

583
00:24:53,863 --> 00:24:55,503
I've made contact with them.

584
00:24:55,503 --> 00:24:57,623
- It's not even labeled murder yet.
- Yeah.

585
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:58,583
- It isn't.
- Just an ongoing investigation.

586
00:24:59,543 --> 00:25:01,783
- It's a totally open investigation, yeah.
- Okay.

587
00:25:03,223 --> 00:25:04,583
All right, we're back.
It's "Radio on the Bay."

588
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:06,023
George Khouri.

589
00:25:06,023 --> 00:25:07,543
Uh, we've got
our podcast 24-7,

590
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:09,943
all the updates,
KhouriRadio.com.

591
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:11,783
Right now we're just
gonna get right to it.

592
00:25:11,783 --> 00:25:13,943
We've got our esteemed
mayor, John Stockman.

593
00:25:13,943 --> 00:25:16,703
He's got a very important
announcement for the town,

594
00:25:16,703 --> 00:25:18,423
so right now we're just gonna

595
00:25:18,423 --> 00:25:19,743
turn it over to you,
Your Honor.

596
00:25:19,743 --> 00:25:20,983
Hey, Khouri.
Thanks so much.

597
00:25:20,983 --> 00:25:23,303
- I really appreciate this opportunity.
- Absolutely.

598
00:25:23,303 --> 00:25:27,223
There's a lot
of rumors being spread.

599
00:25:27,223 --> 00:25:29,503
And rumors can get you
into nothing but trouble,

600
00:25:29,503 --> 00:25:31,823
as we all know.
So, let me give you

601
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:33,943
a little more clarity
as to what's going on.

602
00:25:33,943 --> 00:25:37,583
And we all know that
during warm weather

603
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:39,063
bacteria levels can rise.

604
00:25:39,063 --> 00:25:42,143
And because of that,
sometimes there are those of us

605
00:25:42,143 --> 00:25:44,423
who pick up some kind
of digestive problems

606
00:25:44,423 --> 00:25:45,903
and sometimes rashes.

607
00:25:45,903 --> 00:25:49,143
It's unfortunate, but it's a
fact of life here on the bay.

608
00:25:49,143 --> 00:25:51,263
However...

609
00:25:51,263 --> 00:25:53,903
and I hope everyone
is paying attention to this...

610
00:25:53,903 --> 00:25:56,383
let's not go around
scaring one another

611
00:25:56,383 --> 00:25:59,103
with crazy
and outlandish stories

612
00:25:59,103 --> 00:26:01,943
that serve no one's benefit.

613
00:26:01,983 --> 00:26:04,063
So, and I can't
stress this enough,

614
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:07,383
if you have a sensitivity
to that type of bacteria,

615
00:26:07,423 --> 00:26:11,343
or if you just want
to take special precautions,

616
00:26:11,343 --> 00:26:13,383
you can limit your time
in the water today.

617
00:26:13,383 --> 00:26:16,543
The bacteria level here
is much, much higher

618
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:19,863
than even the high level
we see after a storm,

619
00:26:19,863 --> 00:26:21,503
and the fertilizer
from the farm

620
00:26:21,503 --> 00:26:23,743
- run into the water.
- You're rushing on the fertilizer.

621
00:26:23,743 --> 00:26:24,943
- Slow down on that.
- Okay.

622
00:26:24,943 --> 00:26:26,783
And the fertilizer
from the farm

623
00:26:26,783 --> 00:26:28,183
are running to the water.

624
00:26:28,183 --> 00:26:29,663
Um...

625
00:26:29,663 --> 00:26:31,743
It's, uh...
not good at all.

626
00:26:31,743 --> 00:26:34,223
It's very, very high.

627
00:26:34,223 --> 00:26:37,183
Yeah, that ending
is kind of sloppy on that.

628
00:26:38,143 --> 00:26:41,063
And if I have any information,

629
00:26:41,063 --> 00:26:42,143
and I do mean to stress this,

630
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:45,863
if I have any information
that would alter those facts...

631
00:26:45,863 --> 00:26:47,343
and I say facts...

632
00:26:47,343 --> 00:26:50,943
I'll be right back here
talking to you again.

633
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,863
And Khouri and everyone
out there,

634
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:55,663
I just want to wish you
the happiest of 4th of Julys.

635
00:26:55,663 --> 00:26:56,543
Thanks again.

636
00:27:01,343 --> 00:27:03,343
There he is.

637
00:27:03,343 --> 00:27:05,143
- There he is.
- Oh, yeah!

638
00:27:05,143 --> 00:27:07,063
Who's buying dinner?

639
00:27:07,063 --> 00:27:08,463
Let's see it, let's see it.

640
00:27:08,463 --> 00:27:09,863
- Reel it in.
- There he is.

641
00:27:09,863 --> 00:27:12,183
That's so big, I don't
think he fits in this boat.

642
00:27:12,183 --> 00:27:13,343
Looks like he's trying to kiss you.

643
00:27:13,343 --> 00:27:14,743
There you go, huh? Nice.

644
00:27:15,703 --> 00:27:18,543
- That's not right, Danny.
- Look at that, Brad, huh?

645
00:27:18,543 --> 00:27:20,063
- That thing's huge.
- That's not right.

646
00:27:20,063 --> 00:27:22,463
It is right.
Look at that thing.

647
00:27:22,463 --> 00:27:23,903
Danny, you ever see
anything like that?

648
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:26,103
What is that?

649
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,423
- I've never seen nothing like that.
- What the heck is it?

650
00:27:27,423 --> 00:27:28,663
Ow! Son of a bitch!

651
00:27:28,663 --> 00:27:30,503
What the...

652
00:27:31,463 --> 00:27:32,783
Get it... get off of me!

653
00:27:32,783 --> 00:27:33,943
What is that?

654
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,383
- Step back!
- Move away!

655
00:27:36,343 --> 00:27:37,903
That thing bit me.

656
00:27:37,903 --> 00:27:40,223
Holy shit, that thing is nasty.

657
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:44,023
All right. Welcome back.
"Radio on the Bay."

658
00:27:44,023 --> 00:27:46,263
It's George Khouri.
We are live on the air,

659
00:27:46,263 --> 00:27:48,863
and of course 24-7,
we got our podcasts.

660
00:27:48,863 --> 00:27:51,303
You can grab 'em.
RadioKhouri.com.

661
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:54,103
Now there's a lot of speculation,
a lot of phone calls coming in.

662
00:27:54,143 --> 00:27:56,503
People not quite sure
what to make of this,

663
00:27:56,503 --> 00:27:58,383
but theories do abound,
my friends.

664
00:27:58,383 --> 00:27:59,503
It's true.

665
00:27:59,503 --> 00:28:02,623
Maybe a satanic cult
has invaded the town.

666
00:28:02,623 --> 00:28:04,543
There's drugs loose in the air.

667
00:28:04,543 --> 00:28:06,543
We've got theories
running wild.

668
00:28:07,503 --> 00:28:10,263
I think it's al-Qaeda,
or whatever it's called.

669
00:28:10,303 --> 00:28:12,583
It's a terrorist plot
to poison the food supply.

670
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:14,543
Gathering a lot of
information about the flu shots

671
00:28:14,543 --> 00:28:15,703
and the vaccines
and how they've caused...

672
00:28:15,703 --> 00:28:16,983
We've been warned
about pesticides.

673
00:28:16,983 --> 00:28:17,903
They're spraying all the food
with them these days.

674
00:28:17,903 --> 00:28:20,783
I saw this strange cloud.

675
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:22,903
It was hovering over the water
down by the bay.

676
00:28:22,903 --> 00:28:25,343
It was this
very circular shape...

677
00:28:25,343 --> 00:28:27,503
Biological warfare.
Um, Iran,

678
00:28:27,503 --> 00:28:29,623
and they're probably trying to
get people out of Guantanamo.

679
00:28:29,663 --> 00:28:32,383
I bet everybody's gonna
say it's about global warming.

680
00:28:35,223 --> 00:28:37,743
I still can't get them.
It's going to voicemail.

681
00:28:38,703 --> 00:28:40,143
Well...

682
00:28:40,143 --> 00:28:42,503
We said we'd meet them
at the pier.

683
00:28:42,503 --> 00:28:44,103
That's what we'll do.
We'll meet them at the pier.

684
00:28:44,103 --> 00:28:46,703
- Okay.
- That's the plan. We'll just...

685
00:28:46,703 --> 00:28:48,303
do that.

686
00:28:52,143 --> 00:28:54,783
Okay, we have
some more dead fish here.

687
00:28:54,783 --> 00:28:56,903
- All mutilated.
- What?

688
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:58,903
- All mutilated.
- Oh, mutilated.

689
00:28:58,943 --> 00:29:01,783
We have... here, we have...
the tongue is missing on these.

690
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:04,423
- No tongue?
- And on these others,

691
00:29:04,423 --> 00:29:07,543
the flesh looks almost
like it's been bitten.

692
00:29:07,543 --> 00:29:10,903
- It's very confusing.
- Why is that?

693
00:29:10,943 --> 00:29:13,183
I'm not sure what does this.

694
00:29:13,183 --> 00:29:15,103
Um, fish don't bite fish.

695
00:29:17,983 --> 00:29:19,623
There she is.

696
00:29:19,623 --> 00:29:20,663
I'm so tired of posing.

697
00:29:20,703 --> 00:29:22,543
- Come on, let me film you.
- No, no, no, no, no.

698
00:29:22,543 --> 00:29:24,663
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, God.

699
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:26,663
I don't wanna end up
on the Internet.

700
00:29:29,543 --> 00:29:32,303
Come on. It's not like I'm gonna
put you naked on my Facebook page

701
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,943
and see what the comments are.

702
00:29:33,943 --> 00:29:35,943
Well, I might, actually.
Now that I think about it.

703
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:38,263
Who knows? I could end up
being a pretty big star.

704
00:29:38,263 --> 00:29:40,823
Uh-huh. Sure.
A big star. Whatever.

705
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,743
This was Denise
Button's digital camera.

706
00:29:43,743 --> 00:29:45,863
She was a star pitcher
for the softball team.

707
00:29:45,863 --> 00:29:47,743
A little shirt off.

708
00:29:47,743 --> 00:29:50,343
- Um, I don't think so.
- Let me see this.

709
00:29:50,343 --> 00:29:53,903
- Aw, come on.
- Why do you want me to do that?

710
00:29:53,903 --> 00:29:56,223
'Cause I wanna see
how beautiful you are.

711
00:29:56,223 --> 00:29:58,463
You already know.

712
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,223
You know my mom doesn't like us
being together in the first place,

713
00:30:00,223 --> 00:30:02,063
so why would I do
something even worse?

714
00:30:02,063 --> 00:30:04,103
Because you like me.

715
00:30:07,943 --> 00:30:09,703
All right, but you
better come in with me.

716
00:30:09,703 --> 00:30:11,783
You're coming in,
no doubt about it.

717
00:30:11,783 --> 00:30:14,263
Whoa.

718
00:30:14,263 --> 00:30:15,583
You better come in after me.

719
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:17,543
Whoo-hoo!

720
00:30:19,463 --> 00:30:22,303
- How's it feel?
- Awesome. Come on!

721
00:30:22,303 --> 00:30:25,143
- No. Mm-mm.
- Come on, baby.

722
00:30:25,183 --> 00:30:27,983
Naw, that's okay. I think you can
just get stung by the jellyfish.

723
00:30:27,983 --> 00:30:29,463
What?

724
00:30:29,463 --> 00:30:31,503
Oh, ha ha.
Very funny.

725
00:30:31,503 --> 00:30:33,943
No, there's seriously
something in the... ow!

726
00:30:33,983 --> 00:30:35,623
You're not getting to me.

727
00:30:37,623 --> 00:30:39,383
You're just jeal...
are you okay?

728
00:30:59,463 --> 00:31:02,663
That camera was
apparently found a month later

729
00:31:02,663 --> 00:31:05,183
by a 12-year-old
on the shore.

730
00:31:08,063 --> 00:31:10,463
Their bodies
were never discovered.

731
00:31:17,103 --> 00:31:20,423
It's so pretty here.

732
00:31:20,423 --> 00:31:22,463
Isn't it?

733
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,263
Hey.

734
00:31:26,263 --> 00:31:27,423
Hello.

735
00:31:27,423 --> 00:31:28,383
- Oh, my God. Look behind you.
- What?

736
00:31:28,383 --> 00:31:31,583
Behind you.
It's like a sign.

737
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,503
- Oh, is it?
- Yeah.

738
00:31:33,503 --> 00:31:35,223
It's a sign you wanna
make a little love?

739
00:31:35,263 --> 00:31:37,143
Knock it off.
It's not a sex sign.

740
00:31:37,143 --> 00:31:39,063
Oh, well.
It is to me.

741
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,503
- It is a sex sign to me.
- No, everything is...

742
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:44,423
Hi.

743
00:31:50,183 --> 00:31:52,543
Come on. It just helps
it a little bit.

744
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:53,783
No, no.

745
00:31:53,823 --> 00:31:56,383
Sometimes
when I watch this footage,

746
00:31:56,383 --> 00:31:58,743
this private footage...

747
00:31:58,743 --> 00:31:59,983
I mean, here they are.

748
00:31:59,983 --> 00:32:04,103
They're being playful.
They're loving one another.

749
00:32:04,103 --> 00:32:07,503
And they have no idea that
something so much darker

750
00:32:07,503 --> 00:32:10,583
and sinister
is about to happen.

751
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:12,303
- ...you get in the mood?
- Oh, definitely.

752
00:32:12,303 --> 00:32:14,423
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

753
00:32:14,423 --> 00:32:16,583
There we go.
Let's just cool off a little.

754
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,383
Oh, my God.
Alex, Alex, Alex.

755
00:32:18,383 --> 00:32:20,503
- The camera. Put me down.
- Oh, the camera, the camera.

756
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:22,183
- Asshole.
- Ouch!

757
00:32:27,023 --> 00:32:28,063
- Serves you right.
- Wow.

758
00:32:28,063 --> 00:32:30,823
Wow, it tastes...

759
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:34,583
How does it feel in there?

760
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,703
Some went in my mouth.

761
00:32:36,703 --> 00:32:39,503
- Oh, you're coming in at some point.
- Looks so good.

762
00:32:39,503 --> 00:32:41,303
You know that, don't you?

763
00:32:44,183 --> 00:32:46,183
Look at you, up there
on your high boat.

764
00:32:50,983 --> 00:32:53,983
About a hundred years ago,
the sea floor was entirely grass bed,

765
00:32:53,983 --> 00:32:57,823
with enough oysters to self-clean
about every four days.

766
00:32:58,783 --> 00:33:02,543
Today, the bay
is 40% dead zone.

767
00:33:02,543 --> 00:33:04,303
There's nothing here.

768
00:33:04,303 --> 00:33:06,263
Wait, I don't understand.
Are you saying that 40%

769
00:33:06,263 --> 00:33:08,263
- of the bay is a dead zone?
- Is good? Is okay?

770
00:33:08,263 --> 00:33:11,183
No, no. It's not clear
that 40% is dead.

771
00:33:12,823 --> 00:33:14,143
Dr. Abrams.

772
00:33:14,143 --> 00:33:16,223
The CDC is on the line.

773
00:33:16,223 --> 00:33:18,543
They're on right now?

774
00:33:18,543 --> 00:33:19,903
Can you get somebody
to get an orderly?

775
00:33:19,903 --> 00:33:22,423
Get that guy out of the hall.

776
00:33:22,463 --> 00:33:24,503
Put him in 104.

777
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,343
Well? Well?

778
00:33:26,343 --> 00:33:30,423
Uh, yeah. You said
that you have 30 of these...

779
00:33:30,423 --> 00:33:31,863
I have about 60 people

780
00:33:31,863 --> 00:33:33,503
with some kind of blister
and lesion outbreak.

781
00:33:33,503 --> 00:33:35,103
Some of whom went into
anaphylactic shock.

782
00:33:35,103 --> 00:33:37,623
- I have wart overgrowth...
- Excuse me, you said now you have 60 cases?

783
00:33:37,623 --> 00:33:39,263
I just saw three people
with their tongues half gone.

784
00:33:39,263 --> 00:33:41,863
Okay, that's a lot
of information.

785
00:33:41,863 --> 00:33:44,423
Did you administer methicillin
to the lesion victims?

786
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:47,583
Of course I gave them methicillin.
It had no response.

787
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:50,463
- What do you mean?
- It kept spreading.

788
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:53,143
- In how many cases?
- In all of the cases.

789
00:33:53,183 --> 00:33:54,623
Okay, that's important.

790
00:33:54,623 --> 00:33:56,143
Yeah, I know that's important
because they still have

791
00:33:56,143 --> 00:33:57,183
spreading lesions.

792
00:33:57,183 --> 00:33:59,223
Do you have any
new information for me?

793
00:34:01,143 --> 00:34:02,983
Not at this time.

794
00:34:02,983 --> 00:34:04,943
This could be
any number of things.

795
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,823
It could be fungal
or bacterial.

796
00:34:06,823 --> 00:34:09,303
- Fungal?
- We had a tropical fungus outbreak

797
00:34:09,303 --> 00:34:12,343
last year in Vancouver.

798
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:14,423
Spread in about
three hours, actually.

799
00:34:14,423 --> 00:34:16,463
Vancouver?
Three hours?

800
00:34:16,463 --> 00:34:18,423
Yeah.

801
00:34:18,463 --> 00:34:19,903
With, uh, about 30...

802
00:34:19,903 --> 00:34:21,503
we lost... about 30
people died, I think.

803
00:34:21,503 --> 00:34:23,023
But it was just the fact that

804
00:34:23,023 --> 00:34:24,943
we hadn't seen it in
the northern hemisphere before.

805
00:34:24,943 --> 00:34:26,783
Now, I did wanna ask you.

806
00:34:26,783 --> 00:34:28,063
Did you say that you had people

807
00:34:28,063 --> 00:34:29,903
with half their tongues gone?

808
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:32,343
Uh, yeah. Hold on.
You didn't get pictures?

809
00:34:32,343 --> 00:34:33,903
Did you send those pictures
to the CDC?

810
00:34:33,903 --> 00:34:35,783
You did?

811
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:38,303
You should have an attachment
with pictures we sent you.

812
00:34:38,303 --> 00:34:39,743
Do you have them?

813
00:34:39,743 --> 00:34:41,663
Okay.

814
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:44,223
Okay, we're coming to you

815
00:34:44,223 --> 00:34:46,103
from the straits at Claridge,

816
00:34:46,103 --> 00:34:47,983
where we think we have found...

817
00:34:47,983 --> 00:34:49,623
dun-dun-dun...

818
00:34:49,623 --> 00:34:50,903
the culprit.

819
00:34:50,903 --> 00:34:53,823
Let's go take a look inside
the laboratory here.

820
00:34:53,823 --> 00:34:55,543
See what we got.

821
00:34:55,543 --> 00:34:58,863
As you can see here,
we have these parasites

822
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:01,623
that seem to have latched
onto the gills.

823
00:35:01,623 --> 00:35:04,103
Oh, my God.

824
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:06,303
- This is disgusting.
- Right here.

825
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:08,543
You get it?

826
00:35:08,543 --> 00:35:11,023
There.

827
00:35:11,023 --> 00:35:12,343
This is called

828
00:35:13,303 --> 00:35:15,503
an isopod right here.

829
00:35:17,423 --> 00:35:19,703
It's one of the world's
oldest creatures.

830
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:21,503
Dates back from the
Carboniferous period.

831
00:35:24,383 --> 00:35:25,103
Here.

832
00:35:28,943 --> 00:35:30,303
- Look at that.
- What is that?

833
00:35:30,303 --> 00:35:32,103
Look at that.

834
00:35:32,103 --> 00:35:34,023
It ate right through
the fish's tongue.

835
00:35:34,023 --> 00:35:36,023
This is enormous.

836
00:35:36,023 --> 00:35:38,023
Do you think
this is an anomaly?

837
00:35:38,023 --> 00:35:40,783
Do I think it's...
"omelee"? What?

838
00:35:40,783 --> 00:35:42,023
No, do you think it's normal?

839
00:35:42,023 --> 00:35:43,583
Oh, anomaly.

840
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:44,703
- I don't know.
- It's huge.

841
00:35:44,703 --> 00:35:47,343
I think it's... it must be
some kind of mutated version.

842
00:35:47,343 --> 00:35:48,543
Isopods shouldn't even
be in the brackish water.

843
00:35:48,543 --> 00:35:50,303
This is a huge one.

844
00:35:52,223 --> 00:35:54,143
Look at this.

845
00:35:54,143 --> 00:35:57,223
All these isopods
are eating this fish alive.

846
00:35:58,183 --> 00:35:59,343
I don't understand this.

847
00:36:00,303 --> 00:36:02,023
This doesn't make any sense.

848
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:12,823
What is it?

849
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:20,503
It aches.

850
00:36:20,503 --> 00:36:21,983
The pain in my...

851
00:36:21,983 --> 00:36:24,783
there's something really wrong.

852
00:36:25,743 --> 00:36:28,783
Help me.

853
00:36:46,703 --> 00:36:47,983
What's happening?

854
00:36:47,983 --> 00:36:49,903
I think... I think
you need to see this.

855
00:36:49,903 --> 00:36:51,863
- What's that noise?
- Look how many people are here.

856
00:36:51,863 --> 00:36:53,503
- Oh, my God.
- Look at this.

857
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,423
- Look.
- What's wrong with everyone?

858
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:56,703
- Look at all these people.
- That's Mr. Long.

859
00:36:56,703 --> 00:36:58,343
They need help.

860
00:37:03,103 --> 00:37:04,463
Did... did you just
hear that?

861
00:37:04,463 --> 00:37:06,103
Look.
Look at this.

862
00:37:06,103 --> 00:37:08,023
Look at this.
Look.

863
00:37:08,063 --> 00:37:11,383
- Somebody help me!
- Please, please. Somebody.

864
00:37:11,383 --> 00:37:13,303
They were just
there for a car show.

865
00:37:13,303 --> 00:37:15,263
Within 24 hours, he got ill.

866
00:37:15,263 --> 00:37:16,863
And they said with
this parasite,

867
00:37:16,863 --> 00:37:18,463
that is what happens.

868
00:37:18,463 --> 00:37:20,503
Only his feet
touched the water,

869
00:37:20,503 --> 00:37:22,423
but a short time later,
he became sick.

870
00:37:22,463 --> 00:37:25,263
Doctors say he
was infected by a bacteria

871
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:27,303
called Vibrio vulnificus.

872
00:37:27,303 --> 00:37:29,263
If he'd survived,
he would've lost

873
00:37:29,263 --> 00:37:31,303
his arms and legs.

874
00:37:31,303 --> 00:37:33,383
When walking through brackish
water or at the beach,

875
00:37:33,383 --> 00:37:36,303
if you get a cut, don't just
think it's gonna go away.

876
00:37:36,303 --> 00:37:37,183
You have to seek medical
attention immediately

877
00:37:38,103 --> 00:37:40,663
if it starts to turn red or
you start to feel really bad.

878
00:37:40,663 --> 00:37:43,343
The Vibrio vulnificus bacteria

879
00:37:43,343 --> 00:37:47,583
can lead to heart failure,
loss of limbs, or death.

880
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:49,463
All right, this is the leg
of a man treated today

881
00:37:49,463 --> 00:37:51,583
at Atlantic Hospital
in Maryland.

882
00:37:53,503 --> 00:37:56,063
This is the IR slide
of the same infection.

883
00:37:56,063 --> 00:37:58,823
Notice the bruising
below the skin.

884
00:37:58,823 --> 00:38:00,943
It looks like
Vibrio vulnificus.

885
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:03,823
Now, it's a bit different than
the normal symptoms of a vibrio

886
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,103
or a Cryptosporidium outbreak.

887
00:38:07,343 --> 00:38:11,223
And we got people up there
with their tongues half gone.

888
00:38:11,263 --> 00:38:14,183
So, what have
we got here, people?

889
00:38:14,183 --> 00:38:15,703
Stephanie?

890
00:38:15,743 --> 00:38:19,063
Stephanie, where are you? You're
not answering your phone.

891
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,943
I've been trying to reach you.

892
00:38:20,943 --> 00:38:22,383
I'm at the hospital.

893
00:38:23,183 --> 00:38:25,783
Your dad is at the hospital.

894
00:38:25,783 --> 00:38:29,703
They're taking him in. He has
some kind of very bad infection.

895
00:38:29,703 --> 00:38:33,263
And I think they're going
to amputate his leg.

896
00:38:33,263 --> 00:38:35,543
It's crazy here.

897
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:38,063
I mean, really crazy here.

898
00:38:38,063 --> 00:38:40,543
So the most important thing
is to know

899
00:38:40,543 --> 00:38:43,343
that I do not want you
to get off that boat.

900
00:38:44,303 --> 00:38:45,943
Do you hear me, Stephanie?

901
00:38:45,943 --> 00:38:47,823
Don't get off the boat.

902
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:53,983
- Hey, Stephanie.
- What?

903
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:55,583
Come up here
for a minute, will ya?

904
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,823
And there is
something else I want you to know.

905
00:38:57,823 --> 00:38:59,463
Look at this boat.
It's just adrift.

906
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:00,583
I think I need to tell you.

907
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:02,143
- Grab this camera.
- I have lesions.

908
00:39:02,143 --> 00:39:03,783
Grab the camera...

909
00:39:03,783 --> 00:39:06,903
I think a lot of
people here are not gonna make it.

910
00:39:06,943 --> 00:39:07,703
...and film it
off the side.

911
00:39:07,743 --> 00:39:10,103
I'm gonna come up over...
here it comes.

912
00:39:10,103 --> 00:39:13,143
But remember, I love you,

913
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:15,863
and I will try to call again.

914
00:39:15,863 --> 00:39:17,103
There's nobody in it.

915
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,463
Hey, you see anyone
in the water?

916
00:39:30,103 --> 00:39:32,863
I don't think we can rule out
a food-borne virus

917
00:39:32,863 --> 00:39:34,263
or anything airborne,

918
00:39:34,263 --> 00:39:36,143
but this looks
like a water vector.

919
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:39,063
I agree. The blistering
looks like echinococcosis.

920
00:39:39,063 --> 00:39:40,983
The lesions could be

921
00:39:41,023 --> 00:39:42,583
Mycobacterium marinum

922
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:44,783
or schistosomiasis.

923
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:47,263
I mean, Jesus, there could
be cholera in there.

924
00:39:47,263 --> 00:39:49,703
Yeah, but I don't see
it spreading this fast.

925
00:39:49,703 --> 00:39:52,023
If the water's being polluted
with anything chemical

926
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:53,623
on top of the bacteria,
we could easily

927
00:39:53,663 --> 00:39:56,543
be looking at
a new form evolve.

928
00:39:56,543 --> 00:39:58,023
Maybe a fungal bacteria,

929
00:39:58,023 --> 00:39:59,703
maybe a mutated tapeworm.
Who knows?

930
00:39:59,743 --> 00:40:02,223
I need labs back in two.

931
00:40:02,223 --> 00:40:05,463
I need labs back in two. I need
Prolix and I need morphine.

932
00:40:05,463 --> 00:40:07,583
- Somebody call Materials Management...
- Dr. Abrams.

933
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:09,863
- I need 4x8...
- Dr. Abrams.

934
00:40:09,863 --> 00:40:11,463
- What?
- It's the fellow you amputated.

935
00:40:11,463 --> 00:40:13,223
- What about him?
- It's on the other leg.

936
00:40:13,223 --> 00:40:15,543
- What?
- It's on the other leg.

937
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:17,303
Christ.
I need morphine in two

938
00:40:17,303 --> 00:40:19,023
and I need labs back.
I need labs back STAT.

939
00:40:19,023 --> 00:40:20,223
I have EPA on the line.

940
00:40:20,223 --> 00:40:21,943
What the hell's going on
at the Chesapeake Bay?

941
00:40:21,943 --> 00:40:23,903
What are you talking about?

942
00:40:23,903 --> 00:40:26,543
Is there anything in there
that could cause disease,

943
00:40:26,543 --> 00:40:28,463
bacterial outbreak,
or mutations?

944
00:40:28,463 --> 00:40:30,583
Well, the bay has been
found to have pollutants,

945
00:40:30,623 --> 00:40:33,463
algae, agricultural runoff,

946
00:40:33,463 --> 00:40:35,383
chicken excrement, um...

947
00:40:35,383 --> 00:40:36,823
Go on.

948
00:40:36,823 --> 00:40:40,063
There was a small leak from
a nuclear reactor in 2002.

949
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,143
- God damn it.
- But we weren't expecting it to hit the bay

950
00:40:42,143 --> 00:40:43,543
till 2014.

951
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:44,823
But it is coming
through the ground,

952
00:40:44,863 --> 00:40:46,263
so it could've hit earlier.

953
00:40:46,263 --> 00:40:47,863
Are people drinking this water?

954
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,983
Of course not. The bay is brackish.
You can't drink it.

955
00:40:49,983 --> 00:40:53,783
There is a level of seepage
into local wells

956
00:40:53,783 --> 00:40:55,903
and of course the desalination
plant in Claridge.

957
00:40:55,903 --> 00:40:57,663
With that desalination plant,

958
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,623
we have increased the capacity

959
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,383
for poultry farming
in the area.

960
00:41:01,383 --> 00:41:03,223
Those chickens drink about

961
00:41:03,223 --> 00:41:05,463
2,000 gallons of water a day.

962
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,823
I think the NEF said it was
0.3 liters of dirty water,

963
00:41:08,823 --> 00:41:10,463
so there could be radium
or tritium in there.

964
00:41:10,463 --> 00:41:12,343
...endocrine
disruptors, pharmaceuticals...

965
00:41:12,343 --> 00:41:14,743
Algae, agricultural
runoff, chicken excrement...

966
00:41:14,743 --> 00:41:17,983
There was a small leak from
a nuclear reactor in 2002...

967
00:41:17,983 --> 00:41:19,543
And you don't warn anyone?

968
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,463
Well, it's not under
our regulations

969
00:41:21,463 --> 00:41:23,583
to test for
radioactivity levels in water.

970
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:26,423
Look... half the water in America
probably has some leaks in it.

971
00:41:26,423 --> 00:41:28,063
Don't you regulate the water?

972
00:41:28,063 --> 00:41:31,103
The filtered water has met
all regulatory standards.

973
00:41:33,943 --> 00:41:37,103
- That dome over there...
- 5 million pounds of chicken shit

974
00:41:37,103 --> 00:41:38,703
dumped into the bay each year.

975
00:41:38,703 --> 00:41:41,543
This is the best darn water
I've ever tasted.

976
00:41:48,903 --> 00:41:50,663
What are you doing?
Let's go back this way.

977
00:41:50,663 --> 00:41:53,663
- Just hold on.
- What are you doing?

978
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,823
I can't...
I'm burning up.

979
00:41:55,823 --> 00:41:57,183
Let me just put
some water on my face.

980
00:41:57,183 --> 00:41:58,463
Jesus.

981
00:42:00,383 --> 00:42:02,743
That's my cameraman, Jim Hoyt.

982
00:42:02,743 --> 00:42:04,223
- Hey, Katie Couric.
- Um...

983
00:42:04,223 --> 00:42:06,423
Can you just chill
the fuck out for two seconds?

984
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:09,023
I think that's the only time
we actually ever see him.

985
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,743
- That's not an insult. I like her.
- He died that night.

986
00:42:11,743 --> 00:42:15,223
- I know you do.
- A lot of this footage

987
00:42:15,223 --> 00:42:17,023
is thanks to him.

988
00:42:17,023 --> 00:42:17,903
Where are you going?

989
00:42:17,903 --> 00:42:19,463
Governor's office.

990
00:42:19,463 --> 00:42:21,303
Yeah, hi.
This is Dr. Jack Abrams.

991
00:42:21,303 --> 00:42:22,983
I'm at the Atlantic Hospital
in Claridge.

992
00:42:22,983 --> 00:42:25,623
I need to speak
to the governor immediately.

993
00:42:25,623 --> 00:42:27,543
The governor is
away from his desk.

994
00:42:27,543 --> 00:42:29,503
I don't
understand how the nurses

995
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,623
are just hurrying by
and they're not even stopping.

996
00:42:31,623 --> 00:42:32,983
Look at that.
She didn't even stop.

997
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,463
Scoot up.

998
00:42:34,463 --> 00:42:37,823
- Look, I am.
- There are like 20 feet in front of us.

999
00:42:37,823 --> 00:42:39,743
- Jesus.
- Dad!

1000
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,983
Stop honking the horn!

1001
00:42:41,983 --> 00:42:43,583
- Please stop texting.
- I'm not texting.

1002
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,863
Please don't be YouTubeing this.
Please.

1003
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,983
Oh, my God. She
just said "YouTubeing."

1004
00:42:46,903 --> 00:42:49,103
We're having an
outbreak of some kind here.

1005
00:42:49,103 --> 00:42:51,543
A medical outbreak
down here in Claridge.

1006
00:42:51,543 --> 00:42:53,183
People are dying here.

1007
00:42:53,183 --> 00:42:54,663
I have been speaking to the CDC

1008
00:42:54,663 --> 00:42:56,543
They are moving
at a snail's pace...

1009
00:42:56,543 --> 00:42:57,943
I will pass the
message on to the governor

1010
00:42:57,943 --> 00:42:59,423
- as soon as he gets back.
- What do you mean, you have it?

1011
00:43:00,343 --> 00:43:04,143
Well, go. Go out there and
document everybody that you see.

1012
00:43:04,143 --> 00:43:06,263
Don't document me.
Don't waste the damn film.

1013
00:43:06,263 --> 00:43:07,503
Get back in, please.

1014
00:43:07,503 --> 00:43:09,503
Nobody
ever got off that bridge.

1015
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:12,663
It was shut down
for three days, actually.

1016
00:43:12,663 --> 00:43:14,103
Um...

1017
00:43:14,103 --> 00:43:16,223
I did a lot of research.

1018
00:43:16,223 --> 00:43:19,383
There's no record
of who ordered it shut down.

1019
00:43:19,383 --> 00:43:21,863
I got it on autopilot.

1020
00:43:21,863 --> 00:43:24,423
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

1021
00:43:27,303 --> 00:43:29,183
- GPS is amazing.
- Oh, yeah?

1022
00:43:29,183 --> 00:43:30,543
Really mastered the technology.

1023
00:43:30,543 --> 00:43:32,983
- Yeah, well...
- They said take the next right, though.

1024
00:43:33,943 --> 00:43:35,743
And I don't know
what they're referring to.

1025
00:43:37,623 --> 00:43:40,903
- Just go around in circles.
- That's fine by me.

1026
00:43:56,223 --> 00:43:57,783
You know, we don't
have to be here.

1027
00:43:57,783 --> 00:43:58,983
They're not gonna
post any of this.

1028
00:43:58,983 --> 00:44:00,863
The FBI are not gonna allow it.

1029
00:44:00,863 --> 00:44:02,503
They said we shouldn't
try and scare people.

1030
00:44:02,503 --> 00:44:04,463
Well, there's a little
something called the First Amendment.

1031
00:44:04,463 --> 00:44:05,703
- Is it rolling?
- Yeah, we're rolling.

1032
00:44:09,543 --> 00:44:11,183
Good evening.

1033
00:44:11,183 --> 00:44:13,623
This is Donna Thompson
reporting from what used to be

1034
00:44:13,623 --> 00:44:15,543
the fairgrounds
of the July 4th party...

1035
00:44:19,063 --> 00:44:22,183
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, what was it?

1036
00:44:22,183 --> 00:44:24,263
What the fuck is that?

1037
00:44:28,223 --> 00:44:30,143
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1038
00:44:37,783 --> 00:44:39,623
You say you
were hearing these screams

1039
00:44:39,623 --> 00:44:44,023
all across...

1040
00:44:44,023 --> 00:44:45,503
I'm sorry. The Skype
broke up a little bit.

1041
00:44:45,503 --> 00:44:47,103
What did you say?

1042
00:44:47,103 --> 00:44:48,343
Just echoing through the air?

1043
00:44:48,343 --> 00:44:50,103
I mean, all different
directions?

1044
00:44:50,103 --> 00:44:52,463
Oh, yeah.
I mean, there...

1045
00:44:52,463 --> 00:44:55,623
it was very faint,
but it was very,

1046
00:44:55,623 --> 00:44:57,783
um, prominent.

1047
00:44:57,823 --> 00:44:59,863
I heard them coming from here.

1048
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,663
I've heard them
coming from there.

1049
00:45:01,663 --> 00:45:04,583
It was far away, but...

1050
00:45:05,543 --> 00:45:08,823
it was very ghostlike.

1051
00:45:08,823 --> 00:45:11,263
You know, I...

1052
00:45:11,263 --> 00:45:14,943
And the pain in the people's
voices, I could hear them.

1053
00:45:14,943 --> 00:45:16,943
They were like cries or...

1054
00:45:16,943 --> 00:45:18,663
like cries for help.

1055
00:45:18,663 --> 00:45:19,903
But you didn't know
where anyone was?

1056
00:45:19,903 --> 00:45:23,783
No. I had no idea
where anybody was.

1057
00:45:23,783 --> 00:45:25,623
Be advised.
Need you to respond

1058
00:45:25,623 --> 00:45:27,543
to the corner of
St. James and Highmarket.

1059
00:45:27,543 --> 00:45:29,383
We just got a phone call
in reference to

1060
00:45:29,383 --> 00:45:31,543
hearing some screaming
or some type of

1061
00:45:31,543 --> 00:45:34,823
loud verbal noises
from across the street.

1062
00:45:37,183 --> 00:45:40,983
You think it's, like,
a group or one person?

1063
00:45:41,023 --> 00:45:43,583
- I don't know.
- Like, maybe one of those cults, you know?

1064
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:45,503
Like they were talking
about on the radio?

1065
00:45:45,503 --> 00:45:47,623
I don't know.

1066
00:45:54,343 --> 00:45:55,823
All right.

1067
00:45:55,823 --> 00:45:57,463
Stay here and keep
your eyes out, huh?

1068
00:45:57,503 --> 00:45:58,583
All right.

1069
00:45:58,623 --> 00:46:01,903
What was that?

1070
00:46:05,023 --> 00:46:06,823
Did you hear that?

1071
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:16,263
Police, open up.

1072
00:46:22,943 --> 00:46:25,143
Police, open up.

1073
00:46:25,143 --> 00:46:26,543
I'm gonna go in.

1074
00:46:28,463 --> 00:46:29,943
Hello?

1075
00:46:31,863 --> 00:46:33,383
Hello?

1076
00:46:35,303 --> 00:46:38,343
This is Donna Thompson
reporting from what used to be

1077
00:46:38,343 --> 00:46:41,263
the fairgrounds of the July 4th party.

1078
00:46:41,263 --> 00:46:44,383
Um, at the moment, we are not
quite sure what's going on.

1079
00:47:01,463 --> 00:47:03,423
Central, this is SM 10-12.

1080
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,143
Be advised, shots fired,

1081
00:47:05,143 --> 00:47:07,343
shots fired
at 352 St. James Street.

1082
00:47:07,343 --> 00:47:09,303
Send assistance immediately.

1083
00:47:11,423 --> 00:47:14,143
Central, advise.
Did you copy?

1084
00:47:16,023 --> 00:47:18,583
Central, please advise.
Do you copy?

1085
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:19,863
Send backup.
A shot has been fired

1086
00:47:19,863 --> 00:47:22,583
- Jim?
- at 352 St. James Street.

1087
00:47:25,463 --> 00:47:27,383
- Central, be advised...
- Jim, are you in there?

1088
00:47:27,383 --> 00:47:28,543
I don't know if
anyone's listening there.

1089
00:47:28,543 --> 00:47:30,223
I'm gonna enter
the premises now.

1090
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:33,183
SM 10-18 is
currently inside.

1091
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:36,063
- Please send backup.
- Jim?

1092
00:47:39,903 --> 00:47:41,463
Jim!

1093
00:47:41,463 --> 00:47:44,543
I'm coming in!
I'm coming in!

1094
00:47:47,383 --> 00:47:49,183
- Oh, my God. What's this?
- Please!

1095
00:47:49,183 --> 00:47:51,463
What are you doing?

1096
00:47:51,463 --> 00:47:52,943
No, no, they're not
dying, they're not dying.

1097
00:47:52,943 --> 00:47:56,023
They're all dying, they're all dying.
Look at them all.

1098
00:47:56,023 --> 00:47:58,303
No way. What
have you done, Jim?

1099
00:48:00,223 --> 00:48:02,063
Oh, my God.

1100
00:48:02,063 --> 00:48:03,783
I don't know...
I don't know what they are.

1101
00:48:03,783 --> 00:48:05,183
- What is on those people?
- I don't know what it is.

1102
00:48:05,183 --> 00:48:07,423
It's crawling on their bodies.

1103
00:48:13,143 --> 00:48:15,583
Let's get out of here!

1104
00:48:22,263 --> 00:48:25,303
Did you cut it off?

1105
00:48:30,103 --> 00:48:31,703
You can't do this.

1106
00:48:31,703 --> 00:48:33,623
You can't do this!
Oh, my God!

1107
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:41,503
Get it off, get it off!

1108
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,023
Jim, wait.

1109
00:48:48,023 --> 00:48:49,863
Jim, no, no, no, no!
It's me, Paul.

1110
00:48:55,663 --> 00:48:57,823
This is Cessna 1-5-7.

1111
00:48:58,783 --> 00:49:01,143
Go ahead, Cessna 1-5-7.

1112
00:49:01,143 --> 00:49:04,263
I'm just trying to
figure out what the hell's going on.

1113
00:49:04,263 --> 00:49:06,623
I know they shut down all the
roads going into Claridge,

1114
00:49:06,623 --> 00:49:08,543
but now I'm flying over
the water here

1115
00:49:08,543 --> 00:49:11,183
and there's just, like,
a shitload

1116
00:49:11,183 --> 00:49:13,143
of dead fish everywhere.

1117
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,703
Did you say "dead fish"?

1118
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:17,143
I don't know
how many, but, um...

1119
00:49:17,183 --> 00:49:19,863
it goes as far as I can see.

1120
00:49:19,863 --> 00:49:21,623
So you just got this?

1121
00:49:21,623 --> 00:49:23,703
Yeah, from a research professor

1122
00:49:23,703 --> 00:49:25,463
at the University of Maryland.

1123
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:28,503
And this, uh, Cymothoa exigua?

1124
00:49:28,543 --> 00:49:30,423
Do we have any
information on this?

1125
00:49:30,423 --> 00:49:33,183
Yeah, the exigua
is a crustaceous isopod

1126
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,223
normally found in the Pacific.

1127
00:49:35,223 --> 00:49:37,783
It's been making a number of
appearances in the Atlantic.

1128
00:49:37,783 --> 00:49:40,063
Last year, they found a
two-and-a-half-foot one

1129
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:42,823
trying to burrow its way
into a submarine.

1130
00:49:42,823 --> 00:49:44,543
The thing thought it
was a dead whale.

1131
00:49:44,543 --> 00:49:47,863
Are you making this up?
This looks Photoshopped.

1132
00:49:48,823 --> 00:49:50,663
No, it's real.

1133
00:49:54,503 --> 00:49:57,183
So, how's that getting
into the water supply?

1134
00:49:57,183 --> 00:50:00,023
Well, at normal
scale, they're quite common.

1135
00:50:00,023 --> 00:50:01,703
The fishermen
call them "sea lice."

1136
00:50:01,703 --> 00:50:03,983
Yeah, but, I mean,
it's this big.

1137
00:50:03,983 --> 00:50:06,063
How's it gonna get through
a filtration system?

1138
00:50:06,063 --> 00:50:07,903
Well, what about the larvae?

1139
00:50:09,783 --> 00:50:12,183
All right, now we're bringing up
more questions than we can answer.

1140
00:50:12,183 --> 00:50:14,103
We gotta find out what
happened to those two divers.

1141
00:50:14,103 --> 00:50:16,103
Yeah?

1142
00:50:16,103 --> 00:50:17,023
Let's go.

1143
00:50:23,703 --> 00:50:24,983
Okay, here we are.

1144
00:50:24,983 --> 00:50:26,863
We got a nice break
in the weather.

1145
00:50:26,863 --> 00:50:29,943
So, we're gonna go catch
the current out to Claridge,

1146
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:34,663
take an up-close, personal
look at these parasites.

1147
00:50:34,663 --> 00:50:36,623
See what we're dealing with.

1148
00:50:38,543 --> 00:50:40,303
See, you take a look around,

1149
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:43,223
it's beautiful.
It's breathtaking.

1150
00:50:43,223 --> 00:50:45,143
One of the most beautiful
estuaries in all of America.

1151
00:50:45,143 --> 00:50:47,783
You'd have no idea
what's underneath.

1152
00:50:50,663 --> 00:50:52,863
How was that? Was that
not very good at all?

1153
00:50:52,863 --> 00:50:54,743
- Great.
- What?

1154
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,623
- That was very good.
- Okay, one more time.

1155
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:59,223
A little crisper.

1156
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,823
I feel like I'm sitting
very strangely.

1157
00:51:00,823 --> 00:51:02,743
Do people sit
like this? Okay.

1158
00:51:02,743 --> 00:51:04,383
Now bring the camera to me.

1159
00:51:04,383 --> 00:51:06,623
I'm gonna get us
some beauty shots here.

1160
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:10,703
Get a sense of place here.

1161
00:51:10,703 --> 00:51:12,703
You wanna see the vista,
here, and the sun.

1162
00:51:17,463 --> 00:51:18,983
Beautiful water.

1163
00:51:21,863 --> 00:51:22,903
Beautiful, placid water.

1164
00:51:23,863 --> 00:51:25,823
You have no sense
of how the ecosystem's

1165
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,423
actually being affected.

1166
00:51:29,343 --> 00:51:30,943
You have no idea of the
nightmare underneath here.

1167
00:51:40,183 --> 00:51:42,943
Take an up close and personal
look at these parasites.

1168
00:51:42,943 --> 00:51:44,903
See what we're actually
dealing with.

1169
00:51:45,863 --> 00:51:47,783
We'll go take a look ourselves.

1170
00:52:54,023 --> 00:52:55,863
You can see in this footage

1171
00:52:55,863 --> 00:52:58,703
that the oceanographers dove
right into a school

1172
00:52:58,703 --> 00:53:00,623
of fully-grown isopods.

1173
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:03,703
This is not
the sea lice variety

1174
00:53:03,703 --> 00:53:05,063
or the larvae.

1175
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:09,303
This is what killed them.

1176
00:53:09,303 --> 00:53:11,263
And what killed
those young teenagers.

1177
00:53:13,183 --> 00:53:15,223
The question we
continue to ask is,

1178
00:53:15,263 --> 00:53:17,863
did the authorities
not look at this footage?

1179
00:53:17,863 --> 00:53:20,623
Or chose not to reveal it?

1180
00:53:22,543 --> 00:53:24,183
Jim?

1181
00:53:24,183 --> 00:53:25,103
Jim?

1182
00:53:27,023 --> 00:53:29,063
Do you hear that?

1183
00:53:31,983 --> 00:53:34,183
I hear something.

1184
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:41,223
Yeah, I hear it.

1185
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:54,343
It's this way.

1186
00:53:59,823 --> 00:54:01,143
Do you fucking hear that?

1187
00:54:01,143 --> 00:54:03,743
It's like a moaning
or something.

1188
00:54:08,503 --> 00:54:10,503
Can you come closer?

1189
00:54:43,543 --> 00:54:46,103
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1190
00:54:46,103 --> 00:54:47,903
Oh!

1191
00:54:50,063 --> 00:54:51,703
What do I need to do, Doctor?

1192
00:54:51,703 --> 00:54:53,183
What do I need to do?

1193
00:54:54,143 --> 00:54:55,743
Well, I would suggest that

1194
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,383
you and your staff
leave the hospital.

1195
00:54:59,303 --> 00:55:01,383
My staff left 20 minutes ago.

1196
00:55:02,343 --> 00:55:04,023
Well, good.
That's wise.

1197
00:55:04,023 --> 00:55:06,063
Wise? That's...
why is that wise?

1198
00:55:06,063 --> 00:55:08,303
Well, because the bacteria...

1199
00:55:08,303 --> 00:55:11,703
uh, the... once it's
entered the human body...

1200
00:55:11,703 --> 00:55:14,743
it's a miracle you aren't infected
already, as a matter of fact.

1201
00:55:16,663 --> 00:55:18,903
- I'm... I'm fine.
- Well, that's good.

1202
00:55:18,903 --> 00:55:20,663
But what I'm saying is that,

1203
00:55:20,663 --> 00:55:22,303
at this point,
it is too late, Doctor.

1204
00:55:22,303 --> 00:55:25,303
And I strongly suggest that
you leave immediately.

1205
00:55:26,263 --> 00:55:28,263
Look, I have people
in pain here.

1206
00:55:28,263 --> 00:55:31,223
I'm amputating feet,
I'm amputating legs,

1207
00:55:31,223 --> 00:55:33,103
I'm amputating arms.
You want me to get up

1208
00:55:33,103 --> 00:55:34,863
- and just leave the hospital?
- Yes, we're aware of that,

1209
00:55:34,863 --> 00:55:38,103
Doctor, and we are sorry.

1210
00:55:38,103 --> 00:55:39,983
You need to get...
you need to get somewhere.

1211
00:55:39,983 --> 00:55:41,103
Get some help.

1212
00:55:41,103 --> 00:55:43,583
But don't come here 'cause
they're not gonna help you.

1213
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:45,303
And they're not helping me.

1214
00:55:45,303 --> 00:55:46,903
It looks like there
are dead bodies up there.

1215
00:55:46,903 --> 00:55:48,343
- It's only a rash.
- I'm being serious.

1216
00:55:48,343 --> 00:55:50,303
- Dead people. They're not breathing.
- How can people be dead?

1217
00:55:50,303 --> 00:55:52,983
They just collapsed and no
one's coming out to get them.

1218
00:55:52,983 --> 00:55:55,343
- Nothing. Nope. No one.
- And no one's helping?

1219
00:55:55,343 --> 00:55:56,863
Jennifer, is
your tongue hurting?

1220
00:55:56,863 --> 00:55:59,023
Mine hurts so badly.

1221
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:00,663
I'm just...
I'm really scared.

1222
00:56:00,663 --> 00:56:02,823
I don't know what to do.

1223
00:56:02,823 --> 00:56:04,663
I just... I don't
wanna hang up.

1224
00:56:04,663 --> 00:56:06,503
I don't wanna be by myself.

1225
00:56:06,503 --> 00:56:07,943
I can't get anyone...

1226
00:56:18,503 --> 00:56:20,543
Can you see my parents?
Are they here?

1227
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,663
No.

1228
00:56:21,663 --> 00:56:23,703
There's a bunch of dead shit
in the water.

1229
00:56:23,743 --> 00:56:26,583
- Whoa.
- What is that stuff?

1230
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,063
That is weird.

1231
00:56:29,983 --> 00:56:31,543
Have you heard
anything from the governor yet?

1232
00:56:31,543 --> 00:56:33,383
Yes, Lee. I talked to him.

1233
00:56:33,383 --> 00:56:35,183
The governor wanted to know
if we should call

1234
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,263
a state of emergency.

1235
00:56:36,263 --> 00:56:38,263
And I told him to give us
a few more hours

1236
00:56:38,263 --> 00:56:39,863
to get a handle on this.

1237
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:42,583
Some of the folks have nothing wrong
with them, for heaven's sake.

1238
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:45,823
And the CDC doesn't even know
if it's contagious.

1239
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:48,183
We've got the National Guard isolating us...

1240
00:56:48,183 --> 00:56:50,783
...from surrounding communities
as a preventative measure.

1241
00:56:50,783 --> 00:56:53,463
If we get people in here
with those hazmat suits,

1242
00:56:53,463 --> 00:56:55,103
all hell's gonna break loose.

1243
00:56:55,103 --> 00:56:57,783
Now listen, Lee. Right now
we've got no media on this

1244
00:56:57,783 --> 00:56:59,223
except that student running
around with a camera.

1245
00:56:59,863 --> 00:57:02,143
And the FBI shut down her blog.

1246
00:57:02,143 --> 00:57:03,103
So let's keep it that way.

1247
00:57:03,103 --> 00:57:05,983
And, Lee, you and your deputies

1248
00:57:05,983 --> 00:57:07,863
have got to get on top of this.

1249
00:57:07,863 --> 00:57:09,783
I lost all
contact with my deputies

1250
00:57:09,783 --> 00:57:11,783
about 30 minutes ago.

1251
00:57:11,783 --> 00:57:13,263
What?

1252
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,903
I'm not getting any
response from my guys.

1253
00:57:15,903 --> 00:57:18,583
Well, we shut
down all the towers

1254
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:20,383
to kill the cell phones,

1255
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,463
but it shouldn't
affect you guys.

1256
00:57:22,463 --> 00:57:23,703
Listen, Lee.

1257
00:57:23,703 --> 00:57:26,103
Why don't you swing by
and pick me up right now?

1258
00:57:26,103 --> 00:57:29,223
I wanna get a firsthand look
at what's going on out there.

1259
00:57:30,183 --> 00:57:32,343
All right, I'll be by there
in about five minutes.

1260
00:57:35,223 --> 00:57:36,303
You okay?

1261
00:57:41,103 --> 00:57:43,983
I don't think I've ever been
so scared in my whole life.

1262
00:57:49,743 --> 00:57:51,263
Is the blood off my face?

1263
00:57:51,263 --> 00:57:53,303
- What?
- Is the blood off my face?

1264
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,423
No, you've got
a ton on your side.

1265
00:58:04,023 --> 00:58:05,463
What the...

1266
00:58:05,463 --> 00:58:06,903
- What?
- What is that?

1267
00:58:06,943 --> 00:58:08,343
What is it?

1268
00:58:08,343 --> 00:58:10,743
Holy shit.

1269
00:58:10,743 --> 00:58:12,663
- Fuck.
- What the fuck?

1270
00:58:14,423 --> 00:58:16,263
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

1271
00:58:16,263 --> 00:58:18,023
Look at his face.

1272
00:58:18,023 --> 00:58:20,143
- Oh, my God.
- Look at his face.

1273
00:58:28,543 --> 00:58:29,943
Oh, my God.

1274
00:58:29,983 --> 00:58:32,343
Look at me,
I was running in a circle.

1275
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:35,383
I mean, if it wasn't...

1276
00:58:35,383 --> 00:58:37,783
if this wasn't
a tragedy situation,

1277
00:58:37,783 --> 00:58:39,703
it would actually
be somewhat comedic.

1278
00:58:39,703 --> 00:58:41,263
Um...

1279
00:58:41,263 --> 00:58:43,503
I was just so fucking scared.

1280
00:58:43,503 --> 00:58:47,103
I... I never reported
another thing after that

1281
00:58:47,103 --> 00:58:48,983
until I made this film.

1282
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,143
I...

1283
00:58:54,023 --> 00:58:57,303
That was actually
the last footage we shot.

1284
00:59:02,103 --> 00:59:03,543
Well, I'll come and
get the rest of the stuff

1285
00:59:03,543 --> 00:59:07,423
when we figure out
where we're going.

1286
00:59:09,383 --> 00:59:12,143
Where are you leading us
other than off of this dock?

1287
00:59:12,143 --> 00:59:14,583
Alex, where do you think?
I have no idea.

1288
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:16,503
I can't get a hold of them.

1289
00:59:16,503 --> 00:59:18,503
This is quite a greeting,
isn't it?

1290
00:59:18,503 --> 00:59:19,943
- Oh, come on.
- This is pretty nice.

1291
00:59:19,943 --> 00:59:21,383
You know, would you please...

1292
00:59:21,383 --> 00:59:23,703
- it's...
- All documented.

1293
00:59:23,703 --> 00:59:27,663
This is the quietest
4th of July I have ever seen.

1294
00:59:27,663 --> 00:59:29,623
We missed the fireworks?
What the hell's going on?

1295
00:59:29,623 --> 00:59:30,903
Yeah, what's with that?

1296
00:59:30,903 --> 00:59:33,743
Is it necessary
to get video of this?

1297
00:59:33,743 --> 00:59:37,303
Yes, I am filming
the lack of fireworks

1298
00:59:37,303 --> 00:59:39,543
so we can show your parents
we were here

1299
00:59:39,543 --> 00:59:42,103
- for the nonfestivities.
- Oh, great. You know, they'll...

1300
00:59:42,103 --> 00:59:44,863
When Alex and
Stephanie got to Claridge,

1301
00:59:44,863 --> 00:59:49,583
more than 700 people had died.

1302
00:59:49,583 --> 00:59:52,023
And here they were,
coming in with a baby.

1303
00:59:52,023 --> 00:59:53,903
...this celebration
for 4th of July.

1304
00:59:53,903 --> 00:59:55,143
Would you
please... You know...

1305
00:59:55,143 --> 00:59:58,063
if you would turn the damn camera
off and help me look for them,

1306
00:59:58,063 --> 00:59:59,663
that might be
a little more useful.

1307
00:59:59,663 --> 01:00:01,143
Oh, you're doing great.
You're doing just...

1308
01:00:01,143 --> 01:00:04,143
- This is fantastic. I love it when you...
- This is ridiculous.

1309
01:00:04,143 --> 01:00:06,903
make me be the grown-up and
you don't do any of the work.

1310
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:10,423
- They all look...
- What the hell is that?

1311
01:00:10,423 --> 01:00:12,423
Oh, my God.

1312
01:00:12,423 --> 01:00:14,063
Oh, God.

1313
01:00:14,063 --> 01:00:16,303
- Alex, Alex...
- Holy shit.

1314
01:00:16,303 --> 01:00:17,743
- Alex, do not take...
- Hello?

1315
01:00:17,743 --> 01:00:20,063
- I wanna get out of here.
- Oh, my God.

1316
01:00:20,063 --> 01:00:24,103
- Look at this.
- Do not get any closer.

1317
01:00:24,103 --> 01:00:26,743
- I want to get out of here...
- Where are we gonna go?

1318
01:00:26,743 --> 01:00:29,023
I don't wanna be out here with
a dead body and Andrew here...

1319
01:00:29,023 --> 01:00:30,863
- Aw, Jesus.
- Stop.

1320
01:00:30,863 --> 01:00:32,863
- No, just...
- Get away from... don't touch her.

1321
01:00:34,783 --> 01:00:37,183
Yes, of course.
A toxic soup of chemicals

1322
01:00:37,183 --> 01:00:38,743
could produce
certain mutations.

1323
01:00:38,743 --> 01:00:40,663
What's also concerning
is the level

1324
01:00:40,663 --> 01:00:42,423
of chicken excrement
in the bay.

1325
01:00:42,423 --> 01:00:44,983
I mean, if the numbers
you gave me are correct,

1326
01:00:44,983 --> 01:00:46,783
the amount of steroids
in that amount of manure,

1327
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:50,103
um, could be
accelerating growth

1328
01:00:50,103 --> 01:00:52,103
by 50, 60 times.

1329
01:00:52,103 --> 01:00:54,423
That's both in size
and quantity.

1330
01:00:54,423 --> 01:00:57,703
This stuff has so much
chemical steroid in it,

1331
01:00:57,703 --> 01:00:59,903
it will take a little birdie,
turn it into a fullgrown birdie

1332
01:00:59,903 --> 01:01:03,543
in 42 days, what Mother Nature
would take six months.

1333
01:01:03,543 --> 01:01:05,583
They think it's feeding off the
nutrients from the chicken runoff.

1334
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:07,463
We've noticed
a five-to-one

1335
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:10,383
female-to-male ratio
among these fish here.

1336
01:01:10,383 --> 01:01:13,223
We could easily be looking
at a new form evolve.

1337
01:01:13,223 --> 01:01:15,223
Ow! Son of a bitch!

1338
01:01:15,223 --> 01:01:17,143
Must be some kind
of mutated version.

1339
01:01:17,143 --> 01:01:18,943
Isopods shouldn't even
be in the brackish water.

1340
01:01:18,943 --> 01:01:20,503
I would like to give Buzz

1341
01:01:20,503 --> 01:01:21,823
a big round of applause

1342
01:01:21,823 --> 01:01:23,703
for getting these
misters going.

1343
01:01:25,743 --> 01:01:27,623
Are people drinking this water?

1344
01:01:27,623 --> 01:01:29,143
Some went in my mouth.

1345
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:31,063
How's it gonna get through
a filtration system?

1346
01:01:31,063 --> 01:01:32,023
What about the larvae?

1347
01:01:33,943 --> 01:01:36,063
The desalination plant
in Claridge...

1348
01:01:37,983 --> 01:01:40,183
A new
form evolve... Steroids...

1349
01:01:40,183 --> 01:01:43,063
So much chemical steroid...
Mutated version...

1350
01:01:43,063 --> 01:01:44,783
They found a
two-and-a-half-foot one

1351
01:01:44,783 --> 01:01:46,703
trying to burrow its way
into a submarine...

1352
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,783
Jane? Jane.

1353
01:01:49,743 --> 01:01:52,223
Get me...

1354
01:01:52,223 --> 01:01:53,183
Will you get me
the White House?

1355
01:01:56,983 --> 01:01:58,383
Oh, my God.

1356
01:01:58,383 --> 01:02:00,223
- Oh, my God.
- Careful, please.

1357
01:02:00,223 --> 01:02:02,663
Oh, you're kidding me.
Holy shit.

1358
01:02:02,663 --> 01:02:05,063
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck?

1359
01:02:05,063 --> 01:02:07,383
Oh, my God.

1360
01:02:09,303 --> 01:02:11,383
Where the hell are we?

1361
01:02:11,383 --> 01:02:14,743
Apparently, a lot
of people came up to Main Street.

1362
01:02:14,743 --> 01:02:16,703
And they were
just waiting for an EMS

1363
01:02:16,703 --> 01:02:19,543
or an ambulance
or someone to come by.

1364
01:02:19,543 --> 01:02:21,303
- Alex, I wanna go.
- Where do you want to go?

1365
01:02:21,343 --> 01:02:23,863
They were just
waiting and hoping.

1366
01:02:23,863 --> 01:02:26,103
Are we gonna get back on the boat in the
middle of the night without any gas?

1367
01:02:26,143 --> 01:02:28,983
I wanna call the police.

1368
01:02:28,983 --> 01:02:31,783
You just told me that
there's no cell phone service.

1369
01:02:31,783 --> 01:02:34,783
- You just told me that.
- Can we go someplace where we have service

1370
01:02:34,783 --> 01:02:36,823
- so we can call the police?
- Look, look.

1371
01:02:36,823 --> 01:02:38,663
This place is open.

1372
01:02:38,663 --> 01:02:40,183
This place is open up here.
Let's go in here.

1373
01:02:40,183 --> 01:02:44,343
- Will you look inside...
- Let's just go in here and regroup.

1374
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:45,903
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1375
01:02:45,903 --> 01:02:47,423
Come on.

1376
01:02:48,343 --> 01:02:51,263
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.

1377
01:02:54,143 --> 01:02:56,823
Um, here.
Let's set this stuff down.

1378
01:02:56,823 --> 01:02:57,903
- Where?
- How is Andrew?

1379
01:02:57,903 --> 01:03:00,703
He's fine.
He's sleeping.

1380
01:03:00,703 --> 01:03:02,143
Well, this
couldn't be creepier.

1381
01:03:04,983 --> 01:03:07,143
- Can we make sure there are no
more dead people in here? - Yes.

1382
01:03:07,143 --> 01:03:09,463
I'll make sure they're not.

1383
01:03:12,343 --> 01:03:13,783
Okay.

1384
01:03:13,783 --> 01:03:14,903
No, this is good.

1385
01:03:14,903 --> 01:03:16,183
This is good.
Let's stay here.

1386
01:03:16,183 --> 01:03:17,623
I'm gonna see if
I can find a landline.

1387
01:03:17,623 --> 01:03:18,903
Maybe I can get one to work.

1388
01:03:18,903 --> 01:03:20,663
Okay.
I'm gonna go out

1389
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:23,343
and see if I see anyone
on the street at all.

1390
01:03:23,343 --> 01:03:25,823
Cops, something.

1391
01:03:26,743 --> 01:03:28,623
- We'll find 'em.
- Find 'em?

1392
01:03:28,623 --> 01:03:30,463
We'll find 'em.

1393
01:03:30,463 --> 01:03:32,423
Nothing's happened.
We just... we just...

1394
01:03:32,423 --> 01:03:35,023
have some deputies off radio.

1395
01:03:35,023 --> 01:03:37,223
You know, if I find these guys
are playing a joke on me...

1396
01:03:37,223 --> 01:03:38,623
Well, they're fired.

1397
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:42,023
I've never had this happen.

1398
01:03:42,023 --> 01:03:43,583
There's got to be a reason.

1399
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:45,863
I'm gonna make the next
town meeting, I can tell you that.

1400
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:49,303
- We're gonna have to get some...
- Come on, Lee.

1401
01:03:49,303 --> 01:03:51,343
That's the last thing we need right now.

1402
01:03:51,343 --> 01:03:54,063
- What's that?
- Put your seatbelt on.

1403
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:55,303
Oh, Jesus.

1404
01:03:55,303 --> 01:03:57,383
You're riding in a police car.

1405
01:03:59,303 --> 01:04:01,783
Yeah, I'm worried
about my seat belt.

1406
01:04:01,783 --> 01:04:04,103
That's what I'm
worried about, right?

1407
01:04:04,103 --> 01:04:05,943
Whose car?

1408
01:04:08,823 --> 01:04:10,903
I think that's Jimson's car.

1409
01:04:10,903 --> 01:04:13,623
- I can't be for sure.
- Is that him in the car?

1410
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:16,543
I don't know.

1411
01:04:16,543 --> 01:04:19,823
- Whose house is this?
- What the hell is he doing, Lee?

1412
01:04:19,823 --> 01:04:21,463
- Now, wait a minute.
- I had to kill 'em.

1413
01:04:21,463 --> 01:04:23,783
That's Jim.

1414
01:04:23,783 --> 01:04:24,983
- What's wrong with him?
- What's wrong with him?

1415
01:04:24,983 --> 01:04:27,983
He looks like
he's done something.

1416
01:04:27,983 --> 01:04:30,423
- Is he drunk?
- He's got his gun out.

1417
01:04:30,423 --> 01:04:33,463
- Go away!
- What's the matter, Jim?

1418
01:04:33,463 --> 01:04:35,743
Come here, buddy!

1419
01:04:36,703 --> 01:04:38,583
Come here!

1420
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:41,543
Something's
wrong with his face.

1421
01:04:41,543 --> 01:04:43,823
- Oh, God, he's got...
- Oh, Christ.

1422
01:04:43,823 --> 01:04:45,343
- Go away!
- Jim?

1423
01:04:47,223 --> 01:04:48,343
- Go away!
- Come on, Jim.

1424
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:51,063
- Just chill out, buddy!
- Just go!

1425
01:04:51,063 --> 01:04:52,903
Come on!

1426
01:04:53,863 --> 01:04:55,543
Come on and get
in the back of the car.

1427
01:04:55,543 --> 01:04:56,823
Get in the back
of the car, Jim.

1428
01:04:56,823 --> 01:04:58,663
I'll take you to the hospital.

1429
01:04:58,663 --> 01:05:00,863
- Come on, we'll take you somewhere.
- Just go!

1430
01:05:01,783 --> 01:05:04,263
Come on, bud.

1431
01:05:05,223 --> 01:05:07,303
Don't let me lose you, Jim.
Come on, now.

1432
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:09,823
We're all gonna die.

1433
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:12,063
- We're all gonna die.
- Oh, God.

1434
01:05:12,063 --> 01:05:13,303
- I don't wanna die like this.
- It's okay, buddy.

1435
01:05:13,303 --> 01:05:15,063
- I'm coming to get you!
- No, Lee. Lee, stay.

1436
01:05:15,103 --> 01:05:17,143
- No, no, no, no.
- Let him go, Lee.

1437
01:05:17,143 --> 01:05:18,743
No, no, no. We gotta
get him somewhere.

1438
01:05:18,743 --> 01:05:19,983
- You stay here.
- Lee, for God's sake.

1439
01:05:19,983 --> 01:05:22,263
- Jim.
- They're eating my flesh.

1440
01:05:22,263 --> 01:05:23,503
- They're eating everybody's flesh.
- Jim, buddy. Get in the car.

1441
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:25,623
- Let's go somewhere. Come on.
- We're all gonna die.

1442
01:05:25,623 --> 01:05:28,423
- Come on. Hey, what's that?
- We shouldn't have to die like this.

1443
01:05:28,423 --> 01:05:30,063
Huh?

1444
01:05:30,063 --> 01:05:31,303
No, you're not gonna die.
Nobody's gonna die.

1445
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:32,983
Get in the car.

1446
01:05:32,983 --> 01:05:34,023
You don't have
to die like this, sir.

1447
01:05:34,023 --> 01:05:35,423
I can't touch you,
but get in the car.

1448
01:05:35,423 --> 01:05:37,063
Jim, now, wait a minute.

1449
01:05:37,063 --> 01:05:38,743
No, Deputy!
Put that gun down!

1450
01:06:06,583 --> 01:06:08,023
Bill, just hang on
for a second.

1451
01:06:08,063 --> 01:06:09,743
I'm gonna go and get Alex.

1452
01:06:09,743 --> 01:06:11,183
Okay?
Don't go anywhere.

1453
01:06:11,183 --> 01:06:14,103
Alex. Alex?

1454
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:16,063
I got Bill on the Skype.

1455
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:20,183
- Bill, can you hear me?
- Yeah, what's going on?

1456
01:06:20,183 --> 01:06:22,143
Okay, we came to Claridge

1457
01:06:22,143 --> 01:06:23,663
to meet up with my parents.

1458
01:06:23,663 --> 01:06:26,743
- And, um...
- Where are you, at an antique store or something?

1459
01:06:26,743 --> 01:06:27,983
There are these...
there are dead bodies

1460
01:06:27,983 --> 01:06:29,903
- everywhere, Bill.
- What?

1461
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:31,903
- And...
- Bill, the entire town is covered

1462
01:06:31,903 --> 01:06:34,263
- in dead fucking bodies.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

1463
01:06:34,263 --> 01:06:35,583
That's a good one.
All right.

1464
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:37,583
- Bill, please!
- What, are you guys serious?

1465
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:40,023
Yeah, we are entirely
fucking serious here, Bill.

1466
01:06:40,023 --> 01:06:42,223
Oh, okay.
Call the cops, guys.

1467
01:06:42,223 --> 01:06:44,343
No, we called the cops.
We can't get through to them.

1468
01:06:44,343 --> 01:06:45,943
We can't get through
to my parents.

1469
01:06:45,943 --> 01:06:47,743
Our cell phones aren't working.
We can't get service.

1470
01:06:47,743 --> 01:06:50,063
We need for
you to do something.

1471
01:06:50,063 --> 01:06:51,743
Okay, all right.
Where are you?

1472
01:06:51,743 --> 01:06:52,983
Claridge.

1473
01:06:52,983 --> 01:06:54,743
- Claridge?
- Claridge.

1474
01:06:54,743 --> 01:06:55,783
In Maryland, for God's sake.

1475
01:06:55,783 --> 01:06:57,783
- Call somebody, anybody.
- All right, hey.

1476
01:06:57,783 --> 01:06:59,223
Just get us
some help here, please.

1477
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:00,503
Tell me, what happened to you?

1478
01:07:00,503 --> 01:07:02,103
We don't know what happened.

1479
01:07:02,103 --> 01:07:04,983
I mean, what is that
on your neck?

1480
01:07:06,903 --> 01:07:08,863
What's on my neck?

1481
01:07:08,863 --> 01:07:11,063
- Oh, my God, Alex.
- What is it?

1482
01:07:12,023 --> 01:07:13,903
Oh, holy shit.

1483
01:07:23,503 --> 01:07:26,183
My name is
Dr. Jack Abrams.

1484
01:07:26,183 --> 01:07:28,623
I am a physician
at the Atlantic Hospital

1485
01:07:28,623 --> 01:07:30,183
in Maryland.

1486
01:07:34,983 --> 01:07:37,623
I'm making this video
in the hope that

1487
01:07:37,623 --> 01:07:40,503
I will be able to watch it
at some point in the future,

1488
01:07:40,503 --> 01:07:43,423
and I'm gonna show the world
what happened here.

1489
01:07:43,423 --> 01:07:45,783
Uh, coming out
into the hall now...

1490
01:07:45,783 --> 01:07:48,223
I locked myself
in the ICU for...

1491
01:07:52,023 --> 01:07:54,223
The CDC stopped
taking my phone calls.

1492
01:07:54,223 --> 01:07:55,823
Contacted FEMA.
Help hasn't arrived.

1493
01:07:57,743 --> 01:08:01,943
I think I now know
what is killing people.

1494
01:08:01,943 --> 01:08:03,863
We were looking
for some kind of virus,

1495
01:08:03,863 --> 01:08:05,583
some kind of viral outbreak.

1496
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:07,903
And when we called CDC,
they needed to send

1497
01:08:07,903 --> 01:08:12,183
a fucking army down here to put
some goddamn minds together

1498
01:08:12,183 --> 01:08:14,103
to find what I know now,

1499
01:08:14,103 --> 01:08:16,343
which is this is not a virus.
This is an organism.

1500
01:08:16,343 --> 01:08:18,143
It is an organism
that has somehow

1501
01:08:18,143 --> 01:08:19,863
infiltrated these
people's bodies.

1502
01:08:19,863 --> 01:08:22,463
The blistering...
that's a symptom.

1503
01:08:22,463 --> 01:08:24,343
It is not...

1504
01:08:24,343 --> 01:08:27,863
that is what...
that is what threw us off.

1505
01:08:27,863 --> 01:08:30,463
It is the isopod.

1506
01:08:30,463 --> 01:08:32,503
It's eating their organs.

1507
01:08:32,503 --> 01:08:36,383
It's... it's... it's literally
eating them from the inside.

1508
01:08:36,383 --> 01:08:38,303
It is eating their intestines,

1509
01:08:38,303 --> 01:08:40,503
it is eating their liver.
It goes for kidneys,

1510
01:08:40,503 --> 01:08:42,903
lungs, tissue.

1511
01:08:42,903 --> 01:08:46,823
This is a rapidly growing,
accelerating organism.

1512
01:08:46,823 --> 01:08:49,783
How it's growing this fast,
I have no idea.

1513
01:08:49,783 --> 01:08:52,863
Um, I noticed this rash
about 45 minutes ago.

1514
01:08:56,663 --> 01:08:59,703
And I'm gonna continue
to take the camera

1515
01:08:59,703 --> 01:09:04,023
and I'm gonna document
everything that I see here.

1516
01:09:04,023 --> 01:09:06,423
If you find this tape,
just please get it out.

1517
01:09:08,423 --> 01:09:10,303
Get it out.

1518
01:09:58,023 --> 01:10:00,343
Alex? Alex, Jesus!

1519
01:10:00,343 --> 01:10:01,783
- Alex?
- Stephanie, would you please talk to me?

1520
01:10:01,783 --> 01:10:03,223
- What's happening?
- What's wrong?

1521
01:10:03,223 --> 01:10:04,743
Talk to me.
What's wrong?

1522
01:10:04,743 --> 01:10:06,703
- Alex?
- There's something crawling

1523
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:08,703
inside of my stomach.

1524
01:10:08,703 --> 01:10:11,823
Alex.

1525
01:10:11,823 --> 01:10:13,383
Please explain
to me what's going on.

1526
01:10:13,383 --> 01:10:16,023
Okay.

1527
01:10:16,023 --> 01:10:17,943
- They're coming, they're coming.
- I can't...

1528
01:10:17,943 --> 01:10:20,983
They're gonna come.
Help is here, okay?

1529
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:22,863
You're okay.
You're gonna be fine.

1530
01:10:22,863 --> 01:10:24,703
- It hurts.
- I know, darling.

1531
01:10:24,703 --> 01:10:26,103
I know it hurts,
but we gotta get you outside.

1532
01:10:26,103 --> 01:10:27,703
No!

1533
01:10:31,543 --> 01:10:34,503
I'm in too much pain.
I can't handle it.

1534
01:10:35,463 --> 01:10:39,263
- Alex... no.
- Take it, take it!

1535
01:10:39,263 --> 01:10:41,023
What's wrong with you?
Come on!

1536
01:10:41,023 --> 01:10:45,863
- Please. It's too much.
- No.

1537
01:10:45,863 --> 01:10:48,023
- Help me.
- Alex, come on.

1538
01:10:48,023 --> 01:10:50,063
Help.
Finish...

1539
01:11:13,823 --> 01:11:17,623
Alex died at 1:26 AM.

1540
01:11:17,623 --> 01:11:19,423
The larvae he swallowed
in the bay

1541
01:11:19,423 --> 01:11:20,743
had grown into
a full-sized parasite

1542
01:11:21,703 --> 01:11:24,503
in eight hours
from the toxic soup.

1543
01:11:28,423 --> 01:11:30,623
Hi, this is Steve Slattery
over at Homeland Security.

1544
01:11:30,623 --> 01:11:32,063
I just wanted
to get back to you

1545
01:11:32,063 --> 01:11:34,823
on that message
about Chesapeake Bay.

1546
01:11:35,783 --> 01:11:36,983
Yeah? And?

1547
01:11:36,983 --> 01:11:39,143
Yeah, uh... turns out

1548
01:11:39,143 --> 01:11:41,183
we did hear something
a few weeks back

1549
01:11:41,183 --> 01:11:42,623
about a couple divers' bodies

1550
01:11:42,623 --> 01:11:45,423
being found in the water.
Natural Resources Police

1551
01:11:45,423 --> 01:11:47,263
thought it was
a bull shark bite.

1552
01:11:47,263 --> 01:11:50,223
And they were getting ready
to pull people out of the water

1553
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:51,543
and put up a shark alert,

1554
01:11:51,543 --> 01:11:54,103
but a medical examiner
determined

1555
01:11:54,103 --> 01:11:56,903
that it was not
a shark bite at all.

1556
01:11:56,903 --> 01:11:58,303
What was it?

1557
01:11:58,303 --> 01:12:00,863
They weren't sure, so they
sent reports over to us,

1558
01:12:00,863 --> 01:12:03,703
and then we sent them over
to the Coast Guard

1559
01:12:03,703 --> 01:12:05,423
and they said it didn't make
any sense to them,

1560
01:12:05,423 --> 01:12:07,383
so then we sent it to FEMA
and they never responded,

1561
01:12:07,383 --> 01:12:08,783
so I figured
we'd send it to you.

1562
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:10,623
Yeah, that's good.

1563
01:12:13,503 --> 01:12:15,103
What did the report say?

1564
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:18,023
Well, uh...

1565
01:12:18,023 --> 01:12:20,343
kinda strange stuff.
It said the cause of death was

1566
01:12:20,343 --> 01:12:25,303
"undetermined due
to a multiplicity of parasites

1567
01:12:25,303 --> 01:12:28,103
and a variety of infections."

1568
01:12:28,103 --> 01:12:29,823
Do you want a copy
of this report?

1569
01:12:29,823 --> 01:12:31,463
Oh, yeah.

1570
01:12:31,463 --> 01:12:32,863
Funny enough, I would love to
see a copy of that report.

1571
01:12:36,663 --> 01:12:38,583
Here we are, baby.

1572
01:12:39,383 --> 01:12:41,223
So let me get this straight.

1573
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:44,343
Two divers are found
with a bunch of holes in them

1574
01:12:44,343 --> 01:12:47,663
and all that we know is that
they're mysteriously being eaten

1575
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:48,983
by parasites and infections.

1576
01:12:48,983 --> 01:12:50,423
That's right.

1577
01:12:50,423 --> 01:12:53,583
Nobody knows what
happened and it takes 16 days

1578
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:55,903
to get this information to us?

1579
01:12:55,903 --> 01:12:58,303
Listen, we set
up an incident center

1580
01:12:58,303 --> 01:13:00,223
without cause and we're
in deep doo-doo here.

1581
01:13:00,223 --> 01:13:03,063
Really? Well, I've got
a town full of dead bodies.

1582
01:13:03,063 --> 01:13:04,663
A small town.
I think we need to

1583
01:13:04,663 --> 01:13:06,543
keep this whole thing
in perspective here.

1584
01:13:06,543 --> 01:13:08,823
What kind of perspective
are you talking about?

1585
01:13:11,663 --> 01:13:12,783
Help me! Help me!

1586
01:13:12,783 --> 01:13:14,703
Get off of me!

1587
01:13:14,703 --> 01:13:16,543
Get off of me!

1588
01:13:25,303 --> 01:13:28,663
Listen, it's not that easy to
pull the trigger on something like this.

1589
01:13:28,663 --> 01:13:30,863
We...

1590
01:13:30,863 --> 01:13:33,783
we blow up a nonissue and shut
down the entire Chesapeake Bay...

1591
01:13:33,783 --> 01:13:37,263
I mean, we're talking about beaches,
restaurants, vacation fishing.

1592
01:13:37,263 --> 01:13:41,183
The public panics if word gets out
we're setting up an incident center

1593
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:43,543
about a spreading disease
or for a spreading disease.

1594
01:13:43,543 --> 01:13:46,343
You don't just shut down the
Eastern Seaboard without approval

1595
01:13:46,343 --> 01:13:47,863
from a higher authority.

1596
01:13:47,863 --> 01:13:51,343
Great, I understand. Thank you
very much, Officer Slattery.

1597
01:13:51,343 --> 01:13:52,983
That's it?

1598
01:13:52,983 --> 01:13:55,143
Okay.
Thanks.

1599
01:14:14,303 --> 01:14:17,543
Um, then at about 5:30,

1600
01:14:17,543 --> 01:14:19,223
they came in the hazmat suits,

1601
01:14:19,223 --> 01:14:20,463
and the National Guard came,

1602
01:14:20,463 --> 01:14:23,303
and then they quarantined
the town for another three days

1603
01:14:23,303 --> 01:14:25,623
and that was when they
confiscated

1604
01:14:25,623 --> 01:14:27,023
every single camera
they could find.

1605
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:37,783
You know, there were
those who survived,

1606
01:14:37,783 --> 01:14:41,023
and for some reason,
they never became sick.

1607
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,463
Uh, the town as a whole

1608
01:14:42,463 --> 01:14:45,863
reached a financial agreement
with the government.

1609
01:14:45,863 --> 01:14:48,303
I don't know how much
money changed hands,

1610
01:14:48,303 --> 01:14:50,783
but I do know that silence
was part of the agreement.

1611
01:14:52,703 --> 01:14:54,983
I tried to reach out
to people like Stephanie,

1612
01:14:54,983 --> 01:14:57,623
but she didn't want to
participate in this film.

1613
01:15:05,303 --> 01:15:06,583
Oh, and by the way.

1614
01:15:06,583 --> 01:15:08,823
The official line
from the government

1615
01:15:08,823 --> 01:15:10,423
was that the outbreak
was due to

1616
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:13,623
unseasonably high
water temperatures.

1617
01:15:14,583 --> 01:15:16,503
This is Donna Thompson...

1618
01:15:16,503 --> 01:15:18,503
signing off.

1619
01:15:19,305 --> 01:15:25,426
