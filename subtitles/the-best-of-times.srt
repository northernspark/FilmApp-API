Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:53,420
These are not the best of times.
And nothing comes easy anymore.

3
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,990
In fact, ever since the fall of man,
things have been tough everywhere,

4
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,691
especially in the San Joaquin valley.

5
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:04,096
In 1910, in the southwest corner
of Kern County,

6
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:07,497
god spoke in a gusher of black gold.

7
00:01:07,497 --> 00:01:09,166
We had a chance for greatness,

8
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:11,759
And in 1911,
we changed our name.

9
00:01:14,637 --> 00:01:18,539
That was also the first year
Taft Midway Union High School

10
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:20,640
played Bakersfield High in football.

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,575
We lost...

12
00:01:22,575 --> 00:01:24,776
56 to 0.

13
00:01:24,776 --> 00:01:27,945
We also lost 25,000 barrels
of oil a day

14
00:01:27,945 --> 00:01:30,380
because nobody could figure out
how to cap the well.

15
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,382
But we got on the map.

16
00:01:32,382 --> 00:01:34,751
You got to make trade-offs.
For instance...

17
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:37,451
We've got the worst god damn
weather in the world,

18
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:41,189
but it builds character.
That's a trade-off.

19
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:44,691
And in 1913, we had a chance
to test that character.

20
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:47,192
Taft's own Kid Lester,

21
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:49,694
the toughest bastard ever
to come out of the oil fields,

22
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:51,696
got to fight Sam Langford,

23
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:54,391
the number one heavyweight
contender in the world.

24
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,367
Rumor had it that
Langford was out of shape

25
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:01,303
and didn't take the fight seriously.

26
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:03,939
They say he didn't have
a right hand anymore.

27
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:06,906
Kid Lester predicted a
knockout in the fifth round,

28
00:02:06,906 --> 00:02:09,809
and, unfortunately,
he got it.

29
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:13,579
The Kid slipped quietly out of town
and was never seen again,

30
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:17,240
though he vowed he would
someday return to redeem himself.

31
00:02:18,415 --> 00:02:21,417
Bakersfield beat us
by four touchdowns that year.

32
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:24,319
And then plague was thrown
upon the people of Taft...

33
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,688
that even Jobe didn't
have to deal with... mice.

34
00:02:27,688 --> 00:02:31,924
100 million mice came up out of
a dry lake and marched on Taft.

35
00:02:31,924 --> 00:02:34,227
0nly when thousands of sea gulls

36
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:36,560
flew over from Ventura County
were they beaten back.

37
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,363
Well, eaten back, actually.

38
00:02:39,363 --> 00:02:42,599
It rained all the next winter.

39
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,567
Bakersfield 82,

40
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:46,500
Taft 6.

41
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:50,331
It seems like every year
they beat us 82 to 6,

42
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:54,207
but in 1972, something happened.

43
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,976
A great athlete rose
up out of the Taft desert

44
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,544
to cast a shadow beyond
the boundaries of Kern County.

45
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:03,248
A greek god, a leader of men,
a quarterback.

46
00:03:03,248 --> 00:03:05,681
A great quarterback.

47
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:08,851
We had Reno Hightower.

48
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:12,020
At last, a chance to beat Bakersfield.

49
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,023
November 15, 1972,
our moment in history,

50
00:03:16,023 --> 00:03:18,391
only seconds left
in a scoreless game.

51
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:20,025
Reno goes back to pass.
A golden arm...

52
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:21,526
He lets it fly...
and as he does...

53
00:03:21,526 --> 00:03:24,829
he's hit by half of the Bakersfield team.

54
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:28,131
His knee is smashed.
His career is over.

55
00:03:28,131 --> 00:03:31,333
But what a pass.
Sixty-five yards in the air.

56
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,270
At least we still had a chance
to beat Bakersfield.

57
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,069
And somebody's open!

58
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:37,638
Some third-string wide receiver.

59
00:03:37,638 --> 00:03:40,140
The ball's laid right in his hands,

60
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,404
but that son-of-a-bitch dropped it!

61
00:03:44,644 --> 00:03:48,412
I was that son-of-a-bitch.

62
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:51,415
And as you can see,
my mistake was so horrible,

63
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:53,916
not only has it haunted me
ever since,

64
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:59,053
but it's forced the entire town to
slip quietly into oblivion forever.

65
00:03:59,053 --> 00:04:00,953
Sort of like Kid Lester.

66
00:04:06,992 --> 00:04:09,395
I'm sorry, sir.
Your wife is here.

67
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:11,129
Thank you, Marcy.

68
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:12,619
Go file something.

69
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:15,499
I should've caught the damn thing.

70
00:04:15,499 --> 00:04:17,967
What can I do for you?

71
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,669
I'm sorry to disturb you at work.

72
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:21,269
I know you're a busy man.

73
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,203
Could the bank make a
$100 donation

74
00:04:23,203 --> 00:04:25,672
to the Women's Club production
of "Fiddler on the Roof"?

75
00:04:25,672 --> 00:04:28,574
- We're doing a modern version.
- "If I were that rich dude."

76
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:30,609
How about $200?

77
00:04:30,609 --> 00:04:33,645
Jack, you're a doll.
Jaki's class is having a party.

78
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:36,079
Could you drop off
some potato chips?

79
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,014
Honey, I'm the Vice President
of a bank.

80
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:39,683
- I'm very busy...
- Ruffles.

81
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:41,274
You have it.

82
00:04:42,518 --> 00:04:43,746
Hon?

83
00:04:44,486 --> 00:04:45,887
Are you happy?

84
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:47,087
I'm happy.

85
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,189
Don't just say that to make me happy.

86
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,248
- Are you happy?
- I'm happy!

87
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,693
Me, too.

88
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,160
0h, my god.

89
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,261
Daddy's here.

90
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:57,462
Mayday!

91
00:04:57,462 --> 00:04:59,697
Look busy.

92
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:02,666
- Does this look busy?
- Looks busy to me.

93
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:05,434
Surprise!

94
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:06,835
Hello.

95
00:05:06,835 --> 00:05:09,271
Bring it in, boys.
0n the wall behind the desk.

96
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:10,838
What's that?

97
00:05:10,838 --> 00:05:15,442
Me. I had ten painted.
0ne for each bank.

98
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:18,410
All in the tradition of Velazquez.

99
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,244
So, what do you think?

100
00:05:20,244 --> 00:05:21,946
I like Velazquez.

101
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,747
He's damn good for a Mexican, huh?

102
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:26,816
What are you doing?
Trying to look busy?

103
00:05:26,816 --> 00:05:28,613
Look busy, sir?
I am busy.

104
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:32,354
Don't get hurt.

105
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:34,289
Thank you very much for calling.

106
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:35,618
So, Jack...

107
00:05:36,456 --> 00:05:39,653
What do you think?
Think it's a bit too much?

108
00:05:40,926 --> 00:05:42,561
Tell me the truth.

109
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:45,363
Well, it's slightly ostentatious.

110
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:46,863
Damn right!

111
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:49,165
Grand statement on a grand theme!

112
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:52,901
No brush strokes.
Paid extra for that.

113
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:55,303
Well, butterfingers...

114
00:05:55,303 --> 00:05:58,106
Daddy, I'm sorry
you can't stay longer.

115
00:05:58,106 --> 00:06:00,540
Sorry I can't stay
longer, honey.

116
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,042
Got nine more of these to go.

117
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:03,643
- Is that all?
- Come on, boys.

118
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:06,378
I hope everything's 0K
in Bakersfield.

119
00:06:06,378 --> 00:06:11,181
0K? Bakersfield High's got
one hell of a team this year!

120
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:14,014
Should beat Taft 84 to 0 again!

121
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:16,483
(chuckles)
Bye!

122
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,381
(mocking)
"0K...

123
00:06:22,856 --> 00:06:25,824
Bakersfield High has a great
football team this year!

124
00:06:25,824 --> 00:06:27,693
Should beat Taft..."

125
00:06:27,693 --> 00:06:28,352
[knocking]

126
00:06:35,064 --> 00:06:36,292
0hh.

127
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:40,469
God damn it!

128
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:42,904
Why did Reno Hightower
throw that ball to me?

129
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:44,638
0h, Jack.

130
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,906
You've only seen him once a week
for the last thirteen years.

131
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,242
You've had a thousand chances.
Why don't you ask him?

132
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,611
- What's the problem?
- What's the problem?

133
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,945
The problem is EI,
it's that time of year again

134
00:06:54,945 --> 00:06:57,014
when the first leaf...

135
00:06:57,014 --> 00:07:00,449
"of autumn falls forlornly
on the barren ground below."

136
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:02,986
EI...

137
00:07:02,986 --> 00:07:05,319
- I'm happy, 0K?
- 0K.

138
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,422
Thanks for the donation.

139
00:07:07,422 --> 00:07:10,084
Don't forget the chips.
Bye-bye.

140
00:07:20,464 --> 00:07:22,565
Aw, Carlos, more sharks.

141
00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:24,699
My client wants lots of sharks.

142
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:27,436
Lady Di's got to be in deep shit.

143
00:07:27,436 --> 00:07:28,736
It's more emotional.

144
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:30,704
I thought that was Pia Zadora.

145
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:34,840
- Is this dry yet?
- Yeah, man. It's ready.

146
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,967
0K, take it down.

147
00:07:37,276 --> 00:07:38,868
Easy, now.

148
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:41,337
Careful.

149
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:44,881
What do you think?

150
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,939
- It's your best work, Reno.
- Thanks, man.

151
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:51,120
(sputtering and backfiring)

152
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,254
A little more shading on the bicep.

153
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:55,118
God needs more definition.

154
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:58,458
Hey, Jack. What's your problem?

155
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,086
It sounds like crap.
That's what the problem is.

156
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:07,064
See, it's clicking.
No, it's pinging.

157
00:08:07,064 --> 00:08:09,633
That's just technical talk.

158
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:12,235
You need a valve job.

159
00:08:12,235 --> 00:08:13,770
Reno, I need to talk to you.

160
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,336
Not now, honey.

161
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:16,437
I got a noisy Continental
and a wet Lady Di.

162
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:19,606
You always got a noisy
Continental and a wet Lady Di.

163
00:08:19,606 --> 00:08:21,141
- Hi, Gigi.
- Hi, Jack.

164
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:22,541
I want to talk alone.

165
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,633
Come on.

166
00:08:31,014 --> 00:08:34,249
I don't like being embarrassed
like that in front of the guys.

167
00:08:34,249 --> 00:08:36,485
- It's not good for business.
- Sorry.

168
00:08:36,485 --> 00:08:38,587
What do you want, sweetheart?

169
00:08:38,587 --> 00:08:40,387
I want a divorce.

170
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,990
0K. I know your v-dub
needs a new muffler...

171
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,025
Yeah, and ti-rod bushing
and an exhaust manifold...

172
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,559
That's not why I'm here.

173
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,428
I'll get Eddie on it.

174
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,563
My life's out of tune,
not my v-dub.

175
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:53,965
Well, this is sudden.

176
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:55,265
No, it's not.

177
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:56,766
Come on, Reno, face it...

178
00:08:56,766 --> 00:08:58,901
things haven't been
the way they were between us.

179
00:08:58,901 --> 00:09:01,070
They haven't been
that way for a long time.

180
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,272
I made some notes
so I wouldn't mess up.

181
00:09:03,272 --> 00:09:05,405
"I've gotto get out of Taft."

182
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:09,943
This is no place for
a singer to get launched.

183
00:09:09,943 --> 00:09:12,745
"My mind's made up."
It has been for a long time.

184
00:09:12,745 --> 00:09:16,047
I was waiting for the right time,
but there is no right time.

185
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:19,983
"L..." I was crying
and the words smudged.

186
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:22,484
- I can't read this.
- I can read your writing.

187
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:26,053
"As soon as I get the courage,
I'll talk to Teddy.

188
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:28,688
I'm sorry, I don't want to
be married to you anymore."

189
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:30,121
- Right?
- Right.

190
00:09:37,128 --> 00:09:38,596
I... I got to go.

191
00:09:38,596 --> 00:09:40,085
0h, come on, honey.

192
00:09:41,465 --> 00:09:43,634
I'm moving out.

193
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:45,535
Now, wait a minute, honey.

194
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:47,035
Bye.

195
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:48,670
Aw, come on, Gigi.

196
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,932
Aw, shoot.

197
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,710
Ah, a family spat.

198
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,200
Dinner and a movie,
she'll be fine.

199
00:10:02,614 --> 00:10:04,848
Can I offer you some marital advice?

200
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:05,782
No.

201
00:10:05,782 --> 00:10:08,418
There's only one way a
man can come back to his woman

202
00:10:08,418 --> 00:10:11,253
after she's dumped him
and still maintain one's pride...

203
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:13,422
There's only one way.

204
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:15,924
Crawl, with dignity, of course,

205
00:10:15,924 --> 00:10:18,058
and women will forgive anything.

206
00:10:18,058 --> 00:10:19,581
- Shut up, Jack.
- You got it.

207
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:24,395
Gigi got as far as county line
before she always comes back.

208
00:10:24,395 --> 00:10:26,625
She can't get L.A. Out of her head.

209
00:10:27,898 --> 00:10:30,667
First time she's ever said divorce.

210
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,302
What?

211
00:10:32,302 --> 00:10:33,269
Yeah.

212
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:37,772
That's a terrible word, Reno,
"Divorce", terrible.

213
00:10:37,772 --> 00:10:40,740
She'll leave me
as soon as I fix her car.

214
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,709
- You gonna fix it?
- Hell, no! I love her!

215
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,644
I don't know what to say.

216
00:10:46,644 --> 00:10:48,009
Neither do I.

217
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,915
You got a burned out
intake valve on number five.

218
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:53,517
It's going to cost you 400 bucks.

219
00:10:53,517 --> 00:10:55,279
$400?!

220
00:10:55,618 --> 00:10:59,417
How the hell can I argue with you
when your wife just left you.

221
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:03,058
My great sorrow
at your domestic problems

222
00:11:03,058 --> 00:11:05,592
prevents me from
calling you a crook.

223
00:11:05,592 --> 00:11:07,355
Get out of here.

224
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:10,395
What about my car?

225
00:11:10,395 --> 00:11:12,664
God damnit!
You've got a choice.

226
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:14,398
For $400, I'll fix it right,

227
00:11:14,398 --> 00:11:16,766
or for $1.50,
I'll throw in some STP, again.

228
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:19,368
It'll still run shitty,
but for a week sound great.

229
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:21,970
- So, what do you want?
- Here's $1.50.

230
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,870
In a week,
I might be dead.

231
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,940
Can I at least have a loaner
so I can get back to the bank?

232
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,141
It'll take 15 minutes.

233
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:31,234
I've got a board meeting.

234
00:11:31,944 --> 00:11:33,613
That's all I got.

235
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:35,169
Perfect.

236
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:54,226
Hey, Jack...

237
00:11:54,226 --> 00:11:57,162
Some of us think you
take a loaner every week

238
00:11:57,162 --> 00:11:59,497
because you're going
to the massage parlor

239
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:04,567
and need a car you won't
be recognized in.

240
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:07,866
I won't even dignify that
with a reply.

241
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:13,838
I've never paid for it
in my life.

242
00:12:17,443 --> 00:12:19,273
Adios, muchacho.

243
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,458
- Visa or Mastercard?
- Visa.

244
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,447
Thanks.

245
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,559
0kay, you can start.
Meter's running.

246
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:53,802
There are times when a man must look
deep into the bowels of his soul,

247
00:12:53,802 --> 00:12:56,772
into the darkest
chambers where demons lurk.

248
00:12:56,772 --> 00:12:58,406
What's wrong?

249
00:12:58,406 --> 00:13:00,708
- My wife's unhappy.
- How do you know?

250
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,677
Men know.

251
00:13:02,677 --> 00:13:05,310
- Am I a good lover, Darla?
- The best.

252
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,980
Thank you. How do you know?
We never do it.

253
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,416
Women know. Is that what
we're going to talk about?

254
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:15,018
No. I'm going into
the bowels of hell.

255
00:13:15,018 --> 00:13:16,585
Which bowels of hell?

256
00:13:16,585 --> 00:13:19,587
Taft versus Bakersfield, 1972.

257
00:13:19,587 --> 00:13:21,389
Football.

258
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:23,515
That's a bowel of hell, all right.

259
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:28,326
If I'd caught that ball,
my whole life would be different.

260
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:30,462
This is Ace Jointers and Extruders.

261
00:13:30,462 --> 00:13:33,997
Number 441-06-9542.

262
00:13:33,997 --> 00:13:35,799
$60.

263
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,567
What the hell are you doing?

264
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,035
It's a new rule. We have to
call in anything over $50.

265
00:13:40,035 --> 00:13:42,271
This is outrageous!
I'm emotionally naked!

266
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,572
Get a gold card.
I don't have to call those in.

267
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:45,772
I've applied.

268
00:13:45,772 --> 00:13:48,475
I want to discuss
my darkest sides!

269
00:13:48,475 --> 00:13:51,844
As soon as I get approval.
I hate this, too.

270
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:55,313
It hit me right in the hands!

271
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:58,082
Thank you.
Sorry, Jack. It's no good.

272
00:13:58,082 --> 00:14:00,217
You're right. It's no good.
I can't live like this.

273
00:14:00,217 --> 00:14:01,919
The card!

274
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,852
I'll sue!

275
00:14:03,852 --> 00:14:06,955
Calm down, Jack.

276
00:14:06,955 --> 00:14:10,658
Maybe we can work
something out for under $50.

277
00:14:10,658 --> 00:14:12,860
Can we discuss the game for $50?

278
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,486
- Aw, Jack!
- Please.

279
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:19,997
I know every county
line in San Jaquine valley.

280
00:14:19,997 --> 00:14:22,365
I came here for a little variety.

281
00:14:22,365 --> 00:14:26,368
All I hear about is some tie game played
13 years ago I can barely remember.

282
00:14:26,368 --> 00:14:28,069
0h, come on, Darla.

283
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:30,705
You were gridiron princess.

284
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:32,407
Remember the homecoming queen?

285
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:36,309
Come on. You remember.
Reno remembers.

286
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,010
The whole town remembers.

287
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,345
- 0K, I remember!
- And?

288
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:41,913
You should have caught
the damn ball.

289
00:14:41,913 --> 00:14:43,081
0h, I knew it!

290
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:45,071
0hhh! Aggghhh!

291
00:14:49,185 --> 00:14:50,675
[Sobbing]

292
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:02,095
Can't you make a comeback?

293
00:15:02,095 --> 00:15:03,595
From what?

294
00:15:03,595 --> 00:15:05,597
I'm not a has-been.

295
00:15:05,597 --> 00:15:07,465
I'm a never-was.

296
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:09,666
I aspire to be a has-been.

297
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:14,604
I'm not listening to this crapola,
and it is crapola, every week.

298
00:15:14,604 --> 00:15:16,471
You got unfinished business,
finish it.

299
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:17,739
How?

300
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:19,173
Play the game again.

301
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:21,541
Just play the game again.
You can't play the game again.

302
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,609
- Why not?
- You can't rewrite history.

303
00:15:23,609 --> 00:15:26,011
- Why not?
- It's an unnatural act.

304
00:15:26,011 --> 00:15:28,946
There's no such
thing as an unnatural act.

305
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:31,182
I should know.
Tell me one good reason

306
00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:32,884
you can't play
that game again?

307
00:15:32,884 --> 00:15:34,550
All right, I'll tell you!

308
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,185
You can't because...

309
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,453
Because...

310
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:40,012
0ne reason, Jack.
Just one.

311
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:58,768
- Hey, Teddy.
- Hey, dad.

312
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:00,203
How was school today?

313
00:16:00,203 --> 00:16:02,305
PE was okay.

314
00:16:02,305 --> 00:16:04,639
Shop teacher started
acting weird again.

315
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,842
He told us Taft, California
was the safest place America

316
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,776
in case of a nuclear war.

317
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:13,046
- He said it's the winds.
- That's weird enough.

318
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:14,706
Teddy, are you out there, honey?

319
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,182
I guess mom told you
she's moving?

320
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:19,950
Yeah, she said something.

321
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,018
It's just to the motel.
She'll be back.

322
00:16:22,018 --> 00:16:24,853
Hell, I know. A women needs
breathing room occasionally.

323
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:26,388
Hell, I know.

324
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:29,290
Teddy, give me a hand.

325
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,985
0h, hurry!

326
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,456
Thanks, honey.

327
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,031
I'm bogged down in Taft.

328
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,599
So's your father.
0nly he doesn't know it.

329
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:43,293
Your father's lost his drive.

330
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,466
0h! Careful!

331
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:49,238
I'm going to give singing a shot.

332
00:16:49,238 --> 00:16:52,968
I just don't want
to settle for second-best.

333
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,443
Second-best?

334
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:58,511
Second-best?

335
00:16:58,511 --> 00:17:02,248
I'll tell you why
I don't want to leave Taft.

336
00:17:02,248 --> 00:17:03,881
I'll tell you.

337
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:05,746
It's a fair question.

338
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:09,419
You say why...

339
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:11,721
Why I don't want to leave Taft?

340
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:15,790
- I'm comfortable here.
- This place is a hellhole.

341
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,124
If you knew anything
you'd know...

342
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:22,761
Taft has been judged America's
safest city in case of a nuclear war.

343
00:17:22,761 --> 00:17:25,196
It's because of the winds.

344
00:17:25,196 --> 00:17:27,531
Ha! The winds?

345
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:30,667
0h, man, you're unbelievable!

346
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:33,902
You think the Russians
won't go for the oil fields?

347
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:36,972
They'll wipe out our energy.

348
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,473
Taft will be the first to go.

349
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:42,076
You think they won't hit L. A?

350
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:48,447
0f course they would, but at least
till then I'd be in the big leagues!

351
00:17:48,447 --> 00:17:51,616
Here's another reason I won't leave.

352
00:17:51,616 --> 00:17:54,551
I have a successful business here.

353
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:57,319
You owe six months' mortgage.

354
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,721
Five months!

355
00:17:58,721 --> 00:18:00,356
Besides, you can't leave me yet.

356
00:18:00,356 --> 00:18:02,625
Why not?

357
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,488
Your v-dub doesn't work.

358
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,690
I'm taking it to another shop.

359
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:14,532
0h, wow.

360
00:18:14,532 --> 00:18:17,167
I have never been unfaithful to you.

361
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:18,668
Never.

362
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:22,004
0h, you know...

363
00:18:22,004 --> 00:18:24,631
I'm just tired of all the junk.

364
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,941
The junk in my life...

365
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,273
The junk in this yard.

366
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:36,114
0K, now we're getting somewhere.

367
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:40,918
Name one piece of junk,
and I'll get rid of it.

368
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:42,818
You don't even understand.

369
00:18:42,818 --> 00:18:44,487
- I do.
- No, you don't.

370
00:18:44,487 --> 00:18:46,488
Just name one piece of junk...

371
00:18:46,488 --> 00:18:49,150
junk... and it's gone.

372
00:18:59,197 --> 00:19:00,494
What's this?

373
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,502
That's... a '53 Studebaker brake drum.

374
00:19:05,502 --> 00:19:07,037
It's a classic.

375
00:19:07,037 --> 00:19:09,772
Interchangeable with later
model Volvos, small Chevys,

376
00:19:09,772 --> 00:19:12,474
some imported pickups,
'74s to '78s.

377
00:19:12,474 --> 00:19:13,908
Some '79s.

378
00:19:13,908 --> 00:19:15,841
Right.

379
00:19:20,946 --> 00:19:23,641
I'll be at the Top Hat Motel.

380
00:19:32,155 --> 00:19:33,848
[Honking]

381
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:44,819
Reno, I've got to talk to you.

382
00:19:46,364 --> 00:19:50,535
Reno, I have just
come up with a big idea.

383
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:52,569
It's a one-in-a-lifetime,
monster concept.

384
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:54,303
It's a killer.
You want to hear it?

385
00:19:54,303 --> 00:19:55,705
Can't wait.

386
00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:58,036
We play the game again.

387
00:19:59,474 --> 00:20:00,976
What game?

388
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:02,775
What do you mean,
What game?

389
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:04,577
The game!

390
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:06,579
How many were there,
for Christ's sakes?

391
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:09,715
Your greatest pass,
my greatest drop.

392
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:11,984
0h, that game.

393
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:14,218
You and me are going
to breathe new life

394
00:20:14,218 --> 00:20:16,186
into the bowels of our souls.

395
00:20:16,186 --> 00:20:18,287
We'll charge into chambers
where demons lurk

396
00:20:18,287 --> 00:20:20,122
kick the shit out of
the little bastards...

397
00:20:20,122 --> 00:20:23,590
- and change the miserable past.
- I like the miserable past.

398
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,115
0K! All right!
All right! 0K!

399
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:31,897
If not for me and not for you,

400
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,798
why don't we replay
the game for the whole town.

401
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,427
We can raise Taft out of lethargy.

402
00:20:40,636 --> 00:20:42,904
0kay, you listen to me
for a change.

403
00:20:42,904 --> 00:20:46,173
You dropped the ball.
The whole town didn't.

404
00:20:46,173 --> 00:20:49,710
You want to breathe new life into
the bowels where chambers lurk,

405
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,937
you do it.

406
00:20:53,379 --> 00:20:55,080
Colonel, sir.

407
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,618
I propose we replay
the historic game of 1972.

408
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:03,419
"Jack, Jack, Jack.

409
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,254
Life is short.

410
00:21:05,254 --> 00:21:08,190
I don't have time for
this descent into this..."

411
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,291
...personal madness of yours.

412
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:14,328
In layman's terms,
Jack, you make me sick.

413
00:21:14,328 --> 00:21:16,062
Is that a yes?

414
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:17,496
I'm a busy man.

415
00:21:17,496 --> 00:21:19,865
I got the booster club,
the sports federation...

416
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:21,866
I've got the Black _
0range Roundtable.

417
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:26,302
As you know, I'm the CE0
of the new Potato Bowl.

418
00:21:26,302 --> 00:21:28,604
You think I'm here on my own?

419
00:21:28,604 --> 00:21:30,205
Who could you represent?

420
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:34,007
Taft. The entire god damn town.

421
00:21:34,007 --> 00:21:36,510
I am throwing down the gauntlet!

422
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,378
Gauntlet, my ass!

423
00:21:38,378 --> 00:21:41,647
- I don't believe this!
- Are you afraid, Colonel?

424
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:44,249
Poor Elly, ten years
ago I gave you a job

425
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:46,550
so she wouldn't be
married to a bum.

426
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,552
The day I hear she's
thrown you out,

427
00:21:48,552 --> 00:21:51,154
is the day you resign
from the bank

428
00:21:51,154 --> 00:21:53,989
and slip quietly
out of town forever,

429
00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:57,625
- sort of like Kid Lester.
- That was a lucky punch.

430
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:01,195
Victories for the underdog are
aberrations of the universal order.

431
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:06,065
That's why I've had few losses.

432
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:08,900
The biggest was
you marrying my daughter.

433
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,562
She could have had Johnny "0".

434
00:22:14,004 --> 00:22:18,339
You must admit she'd have been better
off married to this great halfback.

435
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:20,241
I wouldn't say that.

436
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:24,277
Bakersfield high
school football is my life.

437
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:26,411
And your tax write-off.

438
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:29,714
Tax loopholes are a god-given right!

439
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:32,582
Probably even constitutional.

440
00:22:32,582 --> 00:22:35,518
These young men
are like sons to me.

441
00:22:35,518 --> 00:22:39,388
Look at this.
Great men, great poses.

442
00:22:39,388 --> 00:22:42,091
There's more to life than this.

443
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:45,759
0h, Jack, you can't even pose.

444
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:50,930
In your entire life, you've
done one significantly correct thing.

445
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,064
What was that, sir?

446
00:22:53,064 --> 00:22:55,967
You dropped the ball.

447
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:59,236
You verified the order of things.

448
00:22:59,236 --> 00:23:01,939
We accept the challenge.

449
00:23:01,939 --> 00:23:04,539
Well, thank you, sir.

450
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:07,702
With all due respect,
we'll kick your ass.

451
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,745
You're replaying what game?

452
00:23:11,745 --> 00:23:14,746
I'm sick of games and hearing
about some ball you dropped.

453
00:23:14,746 --> 00:23:16,715
I'm sick of anything
with a ball in it.

454
00:23:16,715 --> 00:23:20,017
Let me rephrase my intentions.

455
00:23:20,017 --> 00:23:23,452
What I propose to do,
stated rather simply,

456
00:23:23,452 --> 00:23:26,088
is to remake history.

457
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:28,282
Pass the lima beans, please.

458
00:23:31,459 --> 00:23:34,427
We'll blitz like Dick Butkus
into the future and

459
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:39,261
throw a vicious forearm shiver on
the demon ball carriers of the past.

460
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:44,467
I don't want to talk about
Dick Butkus at the dinner table.

461
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:45,869
I told you that.

462
00:23:45,869 --> 00:23:48,171
Who's Dick Butkus?

463
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:50,539
All American Linebacker for
the University of Illinois.

464
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:54,142
11 years all-pro with the Bears.
Now he's doing beer commercials.

465
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:56,109
And I still don't want
to talk about him.

466
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:57,711
That's fine, Elly.

467
00:23:57,711 --> 00:24:00,280
But this town is headed
into the bowels of hell.

468
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,214
0nly a great victory can act
as an enema for its soul.

469
00:24:03,214 --> 00:24:05,350
That is gross, dad.

470
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,619
Can I be excused?

471
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:10,521
Can't we stay at the table and
talk like other families?

472
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:13,055
[Doorbell play Taft's Alma mater]
Entre.

473
00:24:13,055 --> 00:24:18,092
I'm sick of our doorbell
playing Taft's Alma mater.

474
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:20,527
- It's a great tune!
- Can I be excused?

475
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:22,494
I don't like your fights.

476
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,696
It's not a fight.

477
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,364
It's a disagreement.

478
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:27,765
I forgot.

479
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:29,233
Did you finish your
thank-you notes?

480
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:30,701
0ui.

481
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:32,599
[Crash]

482
00:24:36,071 --> 00:24:38,538
You don't need those
sunglasses inside.

483
00:24:40,275 --> 00:24:42,442
She thinks I'm a fool.

484
00:24:42,442 --> 00:24:45,178
No, she doesn't.
I do.

485
00:24:45,178 --> 00:24:48,181
I've lived with that
dropped ball for 13 years!

486
00:24:48,181 --> 00:24:49,749
I knew you weren't happy.

487
00:24:49,749 --> 00:24:51,616
0nly when you talk
about happiness.

488
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:53,384
The rest of the time
I never think about it.

489
00:24:53,384 --> 00:24:55,519
That's why we'll kill Bakersfield.

490
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,255
If you play that game again,
you'll humiliate me,

491
00:24:59,255 --> 00:25:03,758
you'll humiliate the town and
yourself worse than you can imagine.

492
00:25:03,758 --> 00:25:05,960
You don't think I'll catch it?

493
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,728
I don't care if you catch it,
drop it or sit on it!

494
00:25:08,728 --> 00:25:10,597
How can I live with someone
who doesn't care?

495
00:25:10,597 --> 00:25:12,198
Jack, you're torturing me!

496
00:25:12,198 --> 00:25:14,961
You call the meaning of life torture?

497
00:25:20,836 --> 00:25:23,738
I hate it when we shout.

498
00:25:23,738 --> 00:25:25,607
Me, too.

499
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,336
Jaki's out of the house.

500
00:25:29,743 --> 00:25:32,039
Mr. Weasel's here.

501
00:25:33,545 --> 00:25:35,775
Bon appetit.

502
00:25:37,982 --> 00:25:39,745
0h, Jack.

503
00:25:41,252 --> 00:25:43,946
Elly, I've got a
new move for you.

504
00:25:45,221 --> 00:25:46,789
Show me.

505
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:49,124
It's part Smokey Robinson,
part Gladys Knight,

506
00:25:49,124 --> 00:25:50,454
but it's all me.

507
00:25:52,326 --> 00:25:55,028
Jack Aquarius.

508
00:25:55,028 --> 00:25:57,894
Gotta, gotta, gotta,
gotta satisfy.

509
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:04,168
Sort of a white pip.

510
00:26:04,168 --> 00:26:06,503
I love it.

511
00:26:06,503 --> 00:26:09,528
I love that we can
have sex after fighting.

512
00:26:11,773 --> 00:26:14,297
We do fight about stupid things.

513
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:16,870
Stupid?

514
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:20,879
The game. Give me a kiss.

515
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,847
Honey, let me clarify something.

516
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:26,149
Just because we're making
up after our disagreement

517
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:29,753
doesn't necessarily mean that
the terms of that disagreement

518
00:26:29,753 --> 00:26:33,121
are necessarily resolved.

519
00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:34,990
Am I right?

520
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:40,894
I've given you every Monday night for
13 years so you could watch football.

521
00:26:40,894 --> 00:26:46,999
I've given you most bowl games,
excluding, of course,

522
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:51,502
the hula and blue-gray, which
coincide with our theater production

523
00:26:51,502 --> 00:26:53,203
at the petroleum club.

524
00:26:53,203 --> 00:26:56,296
You've been more than fair.

525
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:02,676
But for the last few
years and the last few months,

526
00:27:02,676 --> 00:27:06,146
your demons have
become my demons,

527
00:27:06,146 --> 00:27:08,409
and quite frankly, baby...

528
00:27:09,882 --> 00:27:12,450
I can't take it anymore.

529
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,551
0hh. Who can?

530
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:18,454
And not to mention,
If you play that game again,

531
00:27:18,454 --> 00:27:24,792
I'll have to put up with a whole
new batch of crap from my father.

532
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:26,660
0h.

533
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,529
I am playing that game again, EI.

534
00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:33,164
Jack, if you play
that game again,

535
00:27:33,164 --> 00:27:36,334
you're not
sleeping in this bed.

536
00:27:36,334 --> 00:27:39,169
Honey, now who's torturing who?

537
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:41,204
It's a tough choice?

538
00:27:41,204 --> 00:27:43,538
0f course.
I love you, but...

539
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:46,029
Take your pick, Jack.

540
00:27:47,575 --> 00:27:50,411
Me...

541
00:27:50,411 --> 00:27:52,105
0r the game.

542
00:27:53,813 --> 00:27:55,081
Huh? Baby.

543
00:27:55,081 --> 00:27:56,843
Which is it?

544
00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:31,967
[Sounds of lovemaking]

545
00:28:34,308 --> 00:28:36,577
[Bed squeaking]

546

[Moaning]

547
00:28:58,126 --> 00:28:59,957
Get out of here or
I'll kick your ass.

548
00:29:03,896 --> 00:29:05,090
That was a cat.

549
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,802
You've got an hour to clear out.

550
00:29:10,802 --> 00:29:13,133
Don't be here when I get back.

551
00:29:35,018 --> 00:29:36,576
Right.

552
00:29:42,057 --> 00:29:44,191
0h, that's a nice sky.

553
00:29:44,191 --> 00:29:45,954
Looks like Taft.

554
00:29:51,797 --> 00:29:53,999
This time I think she's
going to leave me

555
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:56,367
even if I don't fix her car.

556
00:29:56,367 --> 00:29:58,597
I know how you can
get her back.

557
00:30:00,738 --> 00:30:01,804
No, you don't, Jack.

558
00:30:01,804 --> 00:30:05,341
Yes, I do, Reno.
I really do.

559
00:30:05,341 --> 00:30:08,070
Come on.
I want to show you something.

560
00:30:12,746 --> 00:30:14,914
Pose for me.

561
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:16,048
What?

562
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:19,417
- Nobody could pose like you.
- 0h, my god.

563
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:22,118
Give me that one where you're
stiff arming the tackler

564
00:30:22,118 --> 00:30:24,053
and your right arm's cocked
for quick release.

565
00:30:24,053 --> 00:30:26,121
You can't replay that game!

566
00:30:26,121 --> 00:30:28,180
You know what Schutte'd say to that.

567
00:30:29,358 --> 00:30:31,158
"The words of Lucifer.

Let's play some football!" Remember?

570
00:30:38,164 --> 00:30:41,232
Gigi loved you
in the home whites.

571
00:30:41,232 --> 00:30:43,034
And you had on those white shoes.

572
00:30:43,034 --> 00:30:45,502
You were the only quarterback
in the history of Kern County

573
00:30:45,502 --> 00:30:47,337
to have white shoes!

574
00:30:47,337 --> 00:30:50,339
We'd run down that tunnel,
and photographers...

575
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:53,508
"Mr. Hightower."
Boom! Boom! Boom!

576
00:30:53,508 --> 00:30:56,911
And the crowd going,
"Reno! Reno! Reno!"

577
00:30:56,911 --> 00:31:02,114
They're calling your number now.
"Number 12, Reno Hightower!"

578
00:31:02,114 --> 00:31:03,916
Pose... yes!

579
00:31:03,916 --> 00:31:05,684
Don't forget the teeth!

580
00:31:05,684 --> 00:31:08,345
0h, this means you'll play!

581
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:19,893
We'd get killed, Jack.

582
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:23,429
You can't remake history
without an offensive line.

583
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:25,197
We'll get an offensive line.

584
00:31:25,197 --> 00:31:26,698
I don't want to throw
the football anymore.

585
00:31:26,698 --> 00:31:28,066
I can't believe that.

586
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:30,502
I don't even want to
throw a beer can into the trash

587
00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:32,402
'cause if I miss,
some jerk will say,

588
00:31:32,402 --> 00:31:35,064
"Hey, Ren, what's the matter?
Losing the old touch?"

589
00:31:36,473 --> 00:31:38,740
I'm not a quarterback anymore.

590
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,943
I'm a van specialist.
And I like it.

591
00:31:40,943 --> 00:31:43,376
I don't want to play.

592
00:31:43,376 --> 00:31:46,470
Get off your knees.
I'll buy you a beer.

593
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:54,052
You've put me in a
difficult position,

594
00:31:54,052 --> 00:31:56,451
but you do owe me something.

595
00:31:59,656 --> 00:32:03,558
You're not going to pull that on me?

596
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:07,361
Reno, you're behind
on your mortgage payments.

597
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:11,731
If you were our quarterback,

598
00:32:11,731 --> 00:32:15,131
we might be able to arrange
financing for your shop.

599
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,569
You got no shame at all.

600
00:32:19,569 --> 00:32:22,371
I'd like to tell the caribou tomorrow

601
00:32:22,371 --> 00:32:28,707
I have the greatest quarterback
in the history of south Kern County.

602
00:32:31,177 --> 00:32:34,881
Do I hear the variable mortgage
interest rates coming down?

603
00:32:34,881 --> 00:32:38,583
17%. 16%.

604
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:41,385
0h. Coming back up again.

605
00:32:41,385 --> 00:32:43,720
Tell the Caribou
whatever you want.

606
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,355
But I'm going to
tell you something.

607
00:32:45,355 --> 00:32:48,924
You're a lowlife, blackmailing,
chickenshit squid.

608
00:32:48,924 --> 00:32:52,560
"Lowlife, blackmailing,
chickenshit squid."

609
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,528
Welcome aboard, Reno!

610
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:02,026
Hey, Reno!

611
00:33:03,434 --> 00:33:05,732
Are you still the caribou president?

612
00:33:07,504 --> 00:33:09,306
Aaaoooo!

613
00:33:09,306 --> 00:33:10,973
There's your answer.

614
00:33:10,973 --> 00:33:12,841
Give me a beer.

615
00:33:12,841 --> 00:33:15,036
Charlie, I got to ask you a question.

616
00:33:16,644 --> 00:33:18,546
Do you think Taft's lethargic?

617
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:21,280
Damn right. Proud of it.

618
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,616
You don't think we ought to
rise up out of lethargy

619
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:27,685
and breathe new life
into the bowels of our soul?

620
00:33:27,685 --> 00:33:31,587
Hell no. We got it made.
No one bothers us.

621
00:33:31,587 --> 00:33:37,425
500,000 people move into L.A.
Annually and make it miserable.

622
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:40,061
You know how many people
moved into Taft last year?

623
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:43,362
- Just Arthur and Earl.
- That's right.

624
00:33:43,362 --> 00:33:45,965
And if you ask me Arthur won't last.

625
00:33:45,965 --> 00:33:47,489
Come here, Charlie.

626
00:33:48,733 --> 00:33:51,902
Jack Dundee's going
to be coming in here.

627
00:33:51,902 --> 00:33:54,771
He's got a crazy idea
and needs the men of Taft...

628
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:57,106
he's going to tell you
I'm part of it, but I'm not.

629
00:33:57,106 --> 00:34:02,276
Whatever he asks,
you just tell him no.

630
00:34:02,276 --> 00:34:05,074
Anything for a brother Caribou.

631
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:18,854
In short, gentlemen,
we really need the men of Taft

632
00:34:18,854 --> 00:34:26,493
to forge from the foundry of
history a new past and a new future

633
00:34:26,493 --> 00:34:31,830
with, hopefully, a new
present caught in the middle.

634
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:36,960
In closing, I have to say,
Bakersfield must be destroyed!

635
00:34:47,309 --> 00:34:51,011
Motion's on the floor.
Anyone second it?

636
00:34:51,011 --> 00:34:52,145
Second.

637
00:34:52,145 --> 00:34:55,581
Any motion not on the
agenda requires a second second

638
00:34:55,581 --> 00:34:57,550
before discussion.
Second second?

639
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,951
Second second.

640
00:34:58,951 --> 00:34:59,518
- Discussion?
- Discussion.

641
00:34:59,518 --> 00:35:00,718
Second.

642
00:35:00,718 --> 00:35:04,054
Chair thanks Mac Lynch
for seconding these motions

643
00:35:04,054 --> 00:35:06,457
and opens the floor
to discussing the motion

644
00:35:06,457 --> 00:35:11,259
that Taft challenge Bakersfield
to settle the question of who

645
00:35:11,259 --> 00:35:12,693
or is it "whom?"

646
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:13,828
- Who.
- Second.

647
00:35:13,828 --> 00:35:16,229
Who was the best...

648
00:35:16,229 --> 00:35:20,199
Bestest. Best. Bestest. Best. Better.

649
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,432
Second.

650
00:35:21,432 --> 00:35:23,801
Better team in 1972.

651
00:35:23,801 --> 00:35:24,935
Discussion.

652
00:35:24,935 --> 00:35:27,204
I'd like to go on
record and say

653
00:35:27,204 --> 00:35:30,374
I despise Bakersfield
as much as any man in this room.

654
00:35:30,374 --> 00:35:34,009
However, we don't need
to get our butts whipped again

655
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:38,145
by some giant metropolitan city
that has an unfair advantage anyway.

656
00:35:38,145 --> 00:35:41,714
- Exactly.
- Sounds like you're scared.

657
00:35:41,714 --> 00:35:43,915
Yeah! That you'll drop
the damn ball!

658
00:35:43,915 --> 00:35:45,150
0rder!

659
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,352
0rder unto the Caribou!

660
00:35:47,352 --> 00:35:48,686
I'm 0K.

661
00:35:48,686 --> 00:35:51,688
Brother Caribou,
let's not rush to judgment.

662
00:35:51,688 --> 00:35:55,891
Jack may have stumbled
across an idea here.

663
00:35:55,891 --> 00:36:02,796
If Jack, who screwed up so badly,
is willing to replay the game,

664
00:36:02,796 --> 00:36:06,133
then we ought to throw some antlers
in the ring and kick some ass.

665
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:08,167
Yeah!

666
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,535
Kick some ass.

667
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:12,603
No one hates the scum of
Bakersfield worse than I do.

668
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,905
Half the old team lives out of town.

669
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:17,473
And the half that don't
is in miserable shape.

670
00:36:17,473 --> 00:36:20,975
Felipe Rivera's in Fresno,
Luther Jackson lives in San Jose.

671
00:36:20,975 --> 00:36:23,978
0ur whole offensive line
moved away.

672
00:36:23,978 --> 00:36:26,746
Where's Mando, Bam Bam,
and Dickie Larue?

673
00:36:26,746 --> 00:36:28,982
We'll get them back
and we will get in shape.

674
00:36:28,982 --> 00:36:31,082
- We're not organized.
- We'll get organized.

675
00:36:31,082 --> 00:36:32,817
It's against the bylaws.

676
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:36,420
- What? Getting in shape?
- Shit no. Getting organized.

677
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,656
Have we no dignity or pride?

678
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:41,223
I object to your insinuations!

679
00:36:41,223 --> 00:36:43,124
Sit down, Jack!

680
00:36:43,124 --> 00:36:45,558
0rder to the Caribou!

681
00:36:47,529 --> 00:36:49,496
Lodge bellow!

682
00:36:49,496 --> 00:36:51,395
Aaaoooo!

683
00:36:58,036 --> 00:37:01,004
I say in summation,
Jack's idea, no offense,

684
00:37:01,004 --> 00:37:02,539
is sprinkled with horseshit.

685
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:03,907
Discussion over!

686
00:37:03,907 --> 00:37:10,012
All those who think Jack's proposition
is horseshit signify by saying aye.

687
00:37:10,012 --> 00:37:11,612
Aye!

688
00:37:11,612 --> 00:37:12,245
0pposed.

689
00:37:12,245 --> 00:37:13,814
No.

690
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,015
Ayes are above nos.

691
00:37:16,015 --> 00:37:18,683
- I propose we head to for bar.
- Second.

692
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:19,980
Meeting adjourned!

693
00:37:28,725 --> 00:37:31,726
[Telephone rings]

694
00:37:31,726 --> 00:37:33,994
Marcy, I told you never
to disturb me here.

695
00:37:33,994 --> 00:37:38,164
Excuse me for interrupting you,
but the Colonel's on the phone.

696
00:37:38,164 --> 00:37:39,132
Marcy, I can't talk...

697
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:40,432
- Jack!
- Hello, Herbert.

698
00:37:40,432 --> 00:37:41,934
What's happening?

699
00:37:41,934 --> 00:37:44,969
I've got a problem.
Nobody here wants to play the game.

700
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:47,371
Having any luck over there?

701
00:37:47,371 --> 00:37:50,473
There's a lot of excitement here.

702
00:37:50,473 --> 00:37:55,243
I got no players, no coaches, nothing.

703
00:37:55,243 --> 00:37:57,045
0h, my god.

704
00:37:57,045 --> 00:38:00,379
Is there any way
I could get out of this?

705
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:03,983
You've put me in a difficult position

706
00:38:03,983 --> 00:38:07,886
because everyone here's
giddy with expectation.

707
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:16,425
I suppose I could let you
off the hook, but you'll owe me one.

708
00:38:16,425 --> 00:38:19,026
Jack-o, just kidding!

709
00:38:19,026 --> 00:38:20,794
You went for the fake as usual.

710
00:38:20,794 --> 00:38:21,852
Pardon me?

711
00:38:23,663 --> 00:38:26,165
Jack, say hello to Tony Tiger!

712
00:38:26,165 --> 00:38:28,599
Grrr!

713
00:38:29,602 --> 00:38:31,568
Jack, we'll eat you alive.

714
00:38:31,568 --> 00:38:33,971
All right,
here are the rules.

715
00:38:33,971 --> 00:38:36,372
0nly men from
the '72 team can play.

716
00:38:36,372 --> 00:38:39,408
We'll go fifteen minute
quarters, NFL style.

717
00:38:39,408 --> 00:38:42,409
0ne point conversions.
We're pros, right?

718
00:38:42,409 --> 00:38:44,678
0ne more thing, Iron Hands.

719
00:38:44,678 --> 00:38:49,774
When you put on your uniform,
the jockstrap goes on the inside.

720
00:39:22,405 --> 00:39:24,338
Buy me a drink?

721
00:39:25,974 --> 00:39:27,976
Whatever she wants, Chico.

722
00:39:27,976 --> 00:39:30,710
Reno, it's me.

723
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,145
Darla.

724
00:39:32,145 --> 00:39:34,347
Darla Robinson!

725
00:39:34,347 --> 00:39:36,916
I didn't recognize you!

726
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,018
It's been what, 12 years?

727
00:39:39,018 --> 00:39:40,712
13.

728
00:39:51,126 --> 00:39:52,928
Have you seen Jack?

729
00:39:52,928 --> 00:39:57,164
He drives around the house
every night, circles the block,

730
00:39:57,164 --> 00:39:59,865
and heads to the motel.

731
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,466
- Seen Reno?
- No.

732
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:06,804
I think he's been sneaking out to
Darla's the past couple of months.

733
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,706
Darla? Please.

734
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:10,106
Do you think Jack
ever went out there?

735
00:40:10,106 --> 00:40:12,630
0f course not. I'd know.

736
00:40:20,046 --> 00:40:22,515
I remember it
like it was yesterday.

737
00:40:22,515 --> 00:40:25,350
I was standing on the fifty
yard line at half time.

738
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:32,522
I was the damn homecoming queen,
surrounded by rocket princesses.

739
00:40:32,522 --> 00:40:33,716
And pregnant.

740
00:40:35,924 --> 00:40:38,694
We both screwed up.

741
00:40:38,694 --> 00:40:40,761
What do they want?

742
00:40:40,761 --> 00:40:44,397
It's simple what men want.
What men want is more eye make-up.

743
00:40:44,397 --> 00:40:46,867
Lots and lots of eye make-up.

744
00:40:46,867 --> 00:40:49,335
Heavy liner on the bottom lid.

745
00:40:49,335 --> 00:40:51,199
Thank you, Linda.

746
00:40:54,471 --> 00:40:57,304
Hey, Darla,
I got to ask you something.

747
00:40:58,675 --> 00:41:02,444
How many touchdown passes did
I throw against Porterville in '72?

748
00:41:02,444 --> 00:41:05,313
Six. You were terrific.

749
00:41:05,313 --> 00:41:08,082
You were a terrific bastard, too.

750
00:41:08,082 --> 00:41:11,017
But we were undefeated, so it was 0K.

751
00:41:11,017 --> 00:41:13,685
You seem nicer now.

752
00:41:13,685 --> 00:41:15,879
- Nicer?
- Yeah.

753
00:41:27,395 --> 00:41:28,555
Hit it.

754
00:41:33,266 --> 00:41:37,099
I always dreamed the
boy I loved would come along.

755
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:49,272
He'd be tall, handsome,
rich, and strong.

756
00:41:50,711 --> 00:41:53,543
Now that boy I love has come to me.

757
00:41:56,416 --> 00:41:59,112
But it sure ain't the
way I thought it would be.

758
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:04,422
# Sha-la-la-la
Hey, hey, hey #

759
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:07,791
# Sha-la-la-la
Hey, hey, hey #

760
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:11,260
# Sha-la-la-la
Hey, hey, hey #

761
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,693
# 'cause you're the boy I love #

762
00:42:14,296 --> 00:42:17,597
# He don't look like a movie star #

763
00:42:17,597 --> 00:42:21,900
# He don't drive a cadillac car #

764
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,669
# Sure ain't the boy I been dreamin' of #

765
00:42:24,669 --> 00:42:27,160
# but sure is the boy I love #

766
00:42:37,412 --> 00:42:40,514
#... when he holds me tight #

767
00:42:40,514 --> 00:42:44,210
# Everything's right crazy
as it seems #

768
00:42:45,551 --> 00:42:50,721
# I'm his wherever he is
and I forget all of my dreams #

769
00:42:50,721 --> 00:42:52,556
# Everybody knows #

770
00:42:52,556 --> 00:42:55,858
# He doesn't hang diamonds
'round my neck #

771
00:42:55,858 --> 00:42:59,195
# And all he's got's an
unemployment check #

772
00:42:59,195 --> 00:43:02,229
# He sure ain't the boy
I been dreamin' of #

773
00:43:02,229 --> 00:43:04,527
# but he's sure the boy I love #

774
00:43:14,138 --> 00:43:17,440
# I'm his wherever he is #

775
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,808
# But don't forget all
of your dreams #

776
00:43:19,808 --> 00:43:21,376
# But I love him so #

777
00:43:21,376 --> 00:43:23,844
# He doesn't hang
diamonds 'round your neck #

778
00:43:23,844 --> 00:43:27,881
# And all he's got's an
unemployment check #

779
00:43:27,881 --> 00:43:30,849
# Sure ain't the boy
I been dreamin' of #

780
00:43:30,849 --> 00:43:33,352
# But sure the boy I love #

781
00:43:33,352 --> 00:43:34,386
# Whoa-ho-ho. #

782
00:43:34,386 --> 00:43:36,751
Bakersfield kicks ass!

783
00:43:42,124 --> 00:43:43,557
Who was that?

784
00:43:47,595 --> 00:43:49,391
Who the hell did that?

785
00:43:50,897 --> 00:43:53,626
Damn tiger!
I'm going to kick his ass!

786
00:43:55,234 --> 00:43:57,259
I'll kill that bastard.

787
00:44:08,878 --> 00:44:11,242
0f all the dirty tricks!

788
00:44:12,646 --> 00:44:14,514
There's a lunatic out there.

789
00:44:14,514 --> 00:44:16,783
Lunatic, my ass.
It's Bakersfield.

790
00:44:16,783 --> 00:44:18,350
What's is going on here?

791
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:20,451
Chickenshit son of a bitches.

792
00:44:20,451 --> 00:44:21,919
It's terrorism.

793
00:44:21,919 --> 00:44:25,188
Simple god damn terrorism.

794
00:44:25,188 --> 00:44:26,757
We've been violated.

795
00:44:26,757 --> 00:44:28,125
I don't understand this.

796
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:29,257
That's how they work.

797
00:44:29,257 --> 00:44:32,060
They confuse you,
then divide and conquer.

798
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,428
That's how terrorism works.

799
00:44:33,428 --> 00:44:35,562
Damn right.

800
00:44:35,562 --> 00:44:39,232
1971 wasn't 42 to 0.
That was 35 to 0.

801
00:44:39,232 --> 00:44:41,256
This graffiti's all wrong.

802
00:44:43,001 --> 00:44:45,265
0h, my god!

803
00:44:46,171 --> 00:44:48,263
Charlie.

804
00:44:49,572 --> 00:44:51,541
They broke my gavel.

805
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:54,076
Attacking symbols
of office and authority.

806
00:44:54,076 --> 00:44:56,169
It's nihilism, I tell you.

807
00:44:57,413 --> 00:44:58,747
They defaced our women.

808
00:44:58,747 --> 00:45:01,305
We must redeem our dignity and pride.

809
00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:05,052
We'll redeem your
dignity and pride.

810
00:45:05,052 --> 00:45:07,453
My dignity and pride
are just fine, thanks.

811
00:45:07,453 --> 00:45:09,154
I know you're upset.

812
00:45:09,154 --> 00:45:10,922
No shit!

813
00:45:10,922 --> 00:45:13,524
We'll kill Bakersfield for you, ma'am!

814
00:45:13,524 --> 00:45:15,191
Well, I don't care.

815
00:45:15,191 --> 00:45:17,092
You understand that?

816
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:18,994
She cares.

817
00:45:18,994 --> 00:45:21,095
I propose a vote without
a quorum...

818
00:45:21,095 --> 00:45:25,799
that Reno Hightower was the greatest
quarterback in the history of America!

819
00:45:25,799 --> 00:45:27,133
Yeah!

820
00:45:27,133 --> 00:45:28,501
Right!

821
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:30,768
Reno, you're going
to play ball again.

822
00:45:30,768 --> 00:45:32,637
Who said anybody
was replaying anything?

823
00:45:32,637 --> 00:45:34,839
Rosie, tell them
this is all unnecessary.

824
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:38,442
Actually, I'd like
to have my honor defended.

825
00:45:38,442 --> 00:45:40,176
Yeah!

826
00:45:40,176 --> 00:45:43,478
Jack, is it too late
to get the game on?

827
00:45:43,478 --> 00:45:45,343
Geez, I don't know.

828
00:45:46,514 --> 00:45:48,447
Ask Mr. Hightower.

829
00:45:51,017 --> 00:45:52,785
God damn it.

830
00:45:52,785 --> 00:45:55,582
Let's kill Bakersfield!

831
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:02,058
If I ever find who
did this, I'll kill him!

832
00:46:02,058 --> 00:46:07,563
Land of hope and glory
'neath the azure skies

833
00:46:07,563 --> 00:46:12,499
where our friendships are welded

834
00:46:12,499 --> 00:46:15,797
ever bonded our ties.

835
00:46:50,126 --> 00:46:52,328
Getting in shape isn't enough.

836
00:46:52,328 --> 00:46:55,063
To remake history,
we need an edge.

837
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:57,599
We don't need an edge,
we need an offensive line.

838
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,930
We need Felipe, Mando,
Bam Bam, Dickie Larue!

839
00:47:10,374 --> 00:47:11,965
Felipe!

840
00:47:12,976 --> 00:47:15,010
Bam Bam!

841
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:16,272
Mando. Mando.

842
00:47:17,612 --> 00:47:20,080
Bam Bam. Bam Bam!

843
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,911
Dickie Larue!

844
00:47:22,716 --> 00:47:25,885
Return to the scene
of their greatest triumphs.

845
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:27,253
Ready!

846
00:47:27,253 --> 00:47:29,019
Set!

847
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:30,145
Hut!

848
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:36,182
Hut! Hut!

849
00:47:45,933 --> 00:47:49,067
0ur offensive line sounds
like a tuberculosis ward.

850
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:50,836
We got to get scientific.

851
00:47:50,836 --> 00:47:52,826
- What do you mean?
- Aerobics.

852
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:54,970
What?

853
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:59,375
1... 2... 3... 4...

854
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:03,078
And 1... 2... 3... 4...

855
00:48:03,078 --> 00:48:04,306
and 1...

856
00:48:05,346 --> 00:48:07,815
Get those legs up there, girls.

857
00:48:07,815 --> 00:48:08,712
Yes!

858
00:48:13,985 --> 00:48:16,010
Now dessert!

859
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,787
Well, what do you think?

860
00:48:30,397 --> 00:48:32,299
I think it's pathetic.

861
00:48:32,299 --> 00:48:35,768
Makes a grown man want to cry.
We gotta get back to fundamentals.

862
00:48:35,768 --> 00:48:37,861
- No shit.
- How do we do that?

863
00:48:50,278 --> 00:48:53,147
Men, this is the play book.

864
00:48:53,147 --> 00:48:56,016
There's more than 200 plays in here.

865
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:59,618
Learn every damn one.

866
00:48:59,618 --> 00:49:01,987
What kind of offense
will Taft run?

867
00:49:01,987 --> 00:49:05,823
0ffense? They're probably
drawing plays in the dirt.

868
00:49:05,823 --> 00:49:08,658
Eddie, this pebble is you.
Chico, you're the bottle cap.

869
00:49:08,658 --> 00:49:11,160
Run a post to this piece of glass.

870
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,628
I thought I was the glass.

871
00:49:13,628 --> 00:49:15,296
You're the twig, damn it!

872
00:49:15,296 --> 00:49:16,964
Twig.

873
00:49:16,964 --> 00:49:19,198
Just go long.

874
00:49:19,198 --> 00:49:21,934
0K. On 4.
Ready? Break!

875
00:49:21,934 --> 00:49:26,504
# Land of hope and glory #

876
00:49:26,504 --> 00:49:31,941
# 'neath the azure skies #

877
00:49:31,941 --> 00:49:36,912

00:49:36,912 --> 00:49:42,282

880
00:49:46,819 --> 00:49:50,955

881

00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:59,628

884
00:50:08,002 --> 00:50:14,802
# Land of our Alma mater

885
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:02,731
BIG RE0PENING S00N

886
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:18,817
Gigi, they've all gone crazy.

887
00:51:18,817 --> 00:51:23,753
Sometimes I think Reno never
knew how to get through to me.

888
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:30,159
Gigi, I know you're inside.

889
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:31,994
I want to talk.

890
00:51:31,994 --> 00:51:33,621
Honey?

891
00:51:35,129 --> 00:51:41,334
0K, honey, just listen
to me and... remember.

892
00:51:41,334 --> 00:51:43,069
God.

893
00:51:43,069 --> 00:51:48,972
# Why do birds suddenly appear... #

894
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:50,607
This is low.

895
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,742
What a cheap shot.

896
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:54,877
#... every time you are near #

897
00:51:54,877 --> 00:52:00,247
# Just like me they like to be... #

898
00:52:00,247 --> 00:52:03,617
Gigi, we got to get you out of here.

899
00:52:03,617 --> 00:52:09,521
# Why do stars fall down
from the sky #

900
00:52:09,521 --> 00:52:13,717
# every time you walk by #

901
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:17,026
This way.
0ut the window.

902
00:52:17,026 --> 00:52:19,027
Come on. Shh.

903
00:52:19,027 --> 00:52:22,129
# Close to you #

904
00:52:22,129 --> 00:52:28,333
# on the day that you were
born the angels got together #

905
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:33,271
# and decided to create
a dream come true #

906
00:52:33,271 --> 00:52:37,041
Careful.
Let's get out of here.

907
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:41,810
#... hair of gold and
starlight in your eyes of blue #

908
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:44,005
tiddle-um, tiddle-um.

909
00:52:59,423 --> 00:53:03,761
Look at all that phony,
virile, pseudo-macho posing.

910
00:53:03,761 --> 00:53:06,129
Yeah.
They look great.

911
00:53:06,129 --> 00:53:08,397
Yeah.

912
00:53:08,397 --> 00:53:10,231
Maybe we've been too rough on them.

913
00:53:10,231 --> 00:53:12,800
I know you don't want to se Reno.

914
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,535
Maybe I could ask Jack to dinner.

915
00:53:15,535 --> 00:53:17,136
Just to talk, of course.

916
00:53:17,136 --> 00:53:18,736
You caving in?

917
00:53:18,736 --> 00:53:22,296
No! There'd be very
strict ground rules.

918
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:27,267
What kind of ground rules?

919
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:39,752
We shouldn't have trouble
with the ground rules.

920
00:53:39,752 --> 00:53:41,820
What ground rules?

921
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,823
There's two things
we can't talk about.

922
00:53:44,823 --> 00:53:46,190
What?

923
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,891
Football and sex.

924
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,893
0h...

925
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,087
Jesus, what will we talk about?

926
00:53:52,795 --> 00:53:55,127
What are we going to talk about?

927
00:53:56,432 --> 00:54:00,196
Steer clear of anything personal.
Don't make it too hard on them.

928
00:54:02,669 --> 00:54:05,137
What if they pass
the Monday-night test?

929
00:54:05,137 --> 00:54:06,968
Then we can get personal.

930
00:54:08,273 --> 00:54:11,901
I'm not getting personal.
I don't care how good they look.

931
00:54:13,743 --> 00:54:15,111
How do I look?

932
00:54:15,111 --> 00:54:16,812
You look hot.

933
00:54:16,812 --> 00:54:18,279
I look like a dork.

934
00:54:18,279 --> 00:54:20,907
You look hot.

935
00:54:22,315 --> 00:54:24,851
What are we going to talk about?

936
00:54:24,851 --> 00:54:26,853
What are we going to talk about?

937
00:54:26,853 --> 00:54:28,920
Go with the flow.

938
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,155
If things go well,

939
00:54:31,155 --> 00:54:33,424
the old magical glow
could kick in...

940
00:54:33,424 --> 00:54:34,891
we might even score.

941
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:37,327
We got to be careful.

942
00:54:37,327 --> 00:54:41,429
Right, careful.
With a hint of reckless.

943
00:54:41,429 --> 00:54:44,299
They like that.
Women and the game.

944
00:54:44,299 --> 00:54:46,733
We could have it all.

945
00:54:46,733 --> 00:54:48,801
I want my wife back.
Don't screw this up.

946
00:54:48,801 --> 00:54:51,634
Hey, me?
I'm in control.

947
00:54:52,871 --> 00:54:54,206
Hey, dad.

948
00:54:54,206 --> 00:54:55,173
Teddy.

949
00:54:55,173 --> 00:54:56,341
- Hi, Mr. Dundee.
- Hi, boys.

950
00:54:56,341 --> 00:54:58,408
We didn't think
you'd show up tonight.

951
00:54:58,408 --> 00:54:59,542
Why not?

952
00:54:59,542 --> 00:55:01,711
It's Monday night.
Atlanta-Minnesota.

953
00:55:01,711 --> 00:55:03,576
My god!
Monday Night Football.

954
00:55:04,746 --> 00:55:07,882
They scheduled it
on Monday night on purpose.

955
00:55:07,882 --> 00:55:11,918
Atlanta and Minnesota have
lost 17 straight games between them.

956
00:55:11,918 --> 00:55:14,487
Even we don't want to watch them.

957
00:55:14,487 --> 00:55:16,420
- Hi, dad.
- Hey, Jaki.

958
00:55:19,423 --> 00:55:21,425
She's glad you came.

959
00:55:21,425 --> 00:55:23,085

to give it a perspective

01:04:37,386 --> 01:04:39,853
If she doesn't, I don't want
to give her any clues.

1118
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:43,892
My bazooka's dead.

1119
01:04:43,892 --> 01:04:46,193
Don't tell me this.

1120
01:04:46,193 --> 01:04:49,462
My arm.
I can't throw anymore.

1121
01:04:49,462 --> 01:04:51,663
- You're great.
- I was never great.

1122
01:04:51,663 --> 01:04:53,732
I was great for around here.

1123
01:04:53,732 --> 01:04:56,134
Every year I got better.

1124
01:04:56,134 --> 01:04:58,735
The kids always ask me about
the six touchdown passes

1125
01:04:58,735 --> 01:05:01,905
I threw against Porterville.

1126
01:05:01,905 --> 01:05:05,040
- Hell, I only threw three tds.
- It was seven.

1127
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,108
I'm not going to argue.
I like seven better.

1128
01:05:07,108 --> 01:05:09,710
Couple more years it'll be eight.
I get better with age.

1129
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:13,245
My knees are killing me.
I'm slow.

1130
01:05:13,245 --> 01:05:15,180
That's why you didn't want to play?

1131
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,648
No.

1132
01:05:17,648 --> 01:05:19,817
I just...

1133
01:05:19,817 --> 01:05:23,052
I didn't want to destroy
the only thing I got left...

1134
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:27,111
those stories about
how great I was.

1135
01:05:31,959 --> 01:05:33,927
You want to know something else?

1136
01:05:33,927 --> 01:05:36,486
Bakersfield is loaded.

1137
01:05:36,595 --> 01:05:39,620
1, 2, 3, 4...

1138
01:05:48,337 --> 01:05:50,395
It's the worst idea
I've ever had.

1139
01:05:56,242 --> 01:05:59,145
We're not going to revive the town.

1140
01:05:59,145 --> 01:06:01,375
We're going to destroy it.

1141
01:06:03,882 --> 01:06:07,084
Is it too late
to call off the game?

1142
01:06:07,084 --> 01:06:10,575
It's even too late
to get out of the dance.

1143
01:06:12,221 --> 01:06:15,289
# Don't say nothin'
bad about my baby #

1144
01:06:15,289 --> 01:06:18,425
# Don't say nothin'
bad about my baby #

1145
01:06:18,425 --> 01:06:19,326
# I love him so #

1146
01:06:19,326 --> 01:06:22,028
# Don't say nothin'
bad about my baby #

1147
01:06:22,028 --> 01:06:25,965
# 0h, don't you know
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby #

1148
01:06:25,965 --> 01:06:27,431
# He's good
He's good #

1149
01:06:27,431 --> 01:06:29,266
# He's good to me
Good to me #

1150
01:06:29,266 --> 01:06:31,368
# And that's all I care about #

1151
01:06:31,368 --> 01:06:33,302
Elly's not coming.

1152
01:06:33,302 --> 01:06:35,538
She'll be here, Jack.

1153
01:06:35,538 --> 01:06:37,471
She wants to see her old friends.

1154
01:06:40,675 --> 01:06:41,942
Better?

1155
01:06:41,942 --> 01:06:45,645
That is disgusting.

1156
01:06:45,645 --> 01:06:47,846
Mom, what is this game all about?

1157
01:06:47,846 --> 01:06:49,515
I want to understand.

1158
01:06:49,515 --> 01:06:54,085
In your life, isn't there something
you wish you'd done differently?

1159
01:06:54,085 --> 01:06:57,712
If you could do it over,
you'd change things?

1160
01:06:59,822 --> 01:07:01,687
No.

1161
01:07:02,757 --> 01:07:06,193
Maybe you have to
be a grown-up to understand.

1162
01:07:06,193 --> 01:07:09,896
T-a-f-t.

1163
01:07:09,896 --> 01:07:11,697
Taft!

1164
01:07:11,697 --> 01:07:14,824
That was Gigi and the Blenders!
Let's give a good hand!

1165
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:20,602
Direct your attention
to the rocket ship.

1166
01:07:20,602 --> 01:07:22,871
Welcome back Luther Jackson,

1167
01:07:22,871 --> 01:07:26,600
the greatest running back
in the history of Kern County!

1168
01:07:30,877 --> 01:07:32,878
It's great to return to one's roots!

1169
01:07:32,878 --> 01:07:34,814
How you doing, man?

1170
01:07:34,814 --> 01:07:36,838
Lighten up!

1171
01:07:55,629 --> 01:07:57,561
Reno, look.

1172
01:07:58,597 --> 01:08:00,132
What do I do now?

1173
01:08:00,132 --> 01:08:01,360
- Be cool.
- Be what?

1174
01:08:05,403 --> 01:08:07,571
She's going straight to Gigi...

1175
01:08:07,571 --> 01:08:09,060
Yeah, and...

1176
01:08:11,239 --> 01:08:13,571
Right to the ladies' room.

1177
01:08:17,577 --> 01:08:19,978
This whole thing is a joke, Gigi.

1178
01:08:19,978 --> 01:08:22,948
He has revived Taft.
Jack's doing everything he said.

1179
01:08:22,948 --> 01:08:24,683
I know.

1180
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:26,750
It's amazing, ain't it?

1181
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,218
Yes.

1182
01:08:28,218 --> 01:08:30,920
Come on.
Dance with the son of a bitch.

1183
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,488
Why should I?

1184
01:08:32,488 --> 01:08:34,356
Because you want to.

1185
01:08:34,356 --> 01:08:36,824
That's not a good reason.

1186
01:08:36,824 --> 01:08:42,028
Then do it because this is his
moment in the sun.

1187
01:08:42,028 --> 01:08:44,864
Tomorrow is Jack's
moment in the sun... the game.

1188
01:08:44,864 --> 01:08:47,665
No, it's tonight
while there's hope,

1189
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:51,600
because tomorrow Bakersfield's
going to slaughter us.

1190
01:08:56,638 --> 01:08:58,540
They've been in there forever.

1191
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:00,375
What the hell are
they talking about?

1192
01:09:00,375 --> 01:09:01,842
Jack-o!

1193
01:09:01,842 --> 01:09:03,144
Reno!

1194
01:09:03,144 --> 01:09:05,212
I can't believe
you guys pulled this off.

1195
01:09:05,212 --> 01:09:08,447
After tomorrow,
Taft won't forget your name.

1196
01:09:08,447 --> 01:09:11,415
We were just talking about
the eight touchdown passes

1197
01:09:11,415 --> 01:09:13,417
you threw against Porterville.

1198
01:09:13,417 --> 01:09:16,685
You don't throw eight tds
without great protection.

1199
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:19,017
Tomorrow, I'll need it.

1200
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:22,587
We're a lean,
mean fighting machine!

1201
01:09:29,962 --> 01:09:31,656
I'm dancing.

1202
01:10:08,256 --> 01:10:11,224
Elly, is that you?

1203
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:17,325
If it isn't, disregard
everything you're about to hear.

1204
01:10:21,132 --> 01:10:26,068
You once told me to choose
between you and the game.

1205
01:10:26,068 --> 01:10:28,003
Well...

1206
01:10:28,003 --> 01:10:31,040
I got it wrong.

1207
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:35,343
Tomorrow we'll get our ass kicked.

1208
01:10:35,343 --> 01:10:41,948
I have no right to ask
you anything at a time like this.

1209
01:10:41,948 --> 01:10:44,583
It would be nice

1210
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:49,644
if you could dance with me.

1211
01:10:56,991 --> 01:10:59,050
Those are your feet,
aren't they?

1212
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:17,569
Jack Aquarius.

1213
01:12:21,685 --> 01:12:24,119
What do you want?

1214
01:12:25,754 --> 01:12:28,484
I want you...

1215
01:12:29,557 --> 01:12:32,024
...to kill Bakersfield.

1216
01:12:34,094 --> 01:12:35,526
0kay.

1217
01:14:08,762 --> 01:14:12,398
Do you do that left to right
or right to left?

1218
01:14:12,398 --> 01:14:14,332
Both ways.
Just in case.

1219
01:14:14,332 --> 01:14:15,559
Yeah.

1220
01:14:17,534 --> 01:14:20,870
- You catholic?
- At the moment.

1221
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,337
Excuse me.

1222
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:31,040
Thank you, Jack.

1223
01:14:34,881 --> 01:14:36,948
Jack, here we are.

1224
01:14:36,948 --> 01:14:39,550
You finally got what you wanted.

1225
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:41,419
Wretched luck.

1226
01:14:41,419 --> 01:14:44,621
Relax. You're going to be a hero.

1227
01:14:44,621 --> 01:14:46,110
What if I'm not?

1228
01:14:47,656 --> 01:14:49,589
It's just a game.

1229
01:14:58,831 --> 01:15:00,423
Just a game.

1230
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,008
Kickoff time, sports fans.

1231
01:15:15,008 --> 01:15:19,712
0utlined against the November sky,
the four horsemen ride again.

1232
01:15:19,712 --> 01:15:23,716
They were once known as disease,
famine, pestilence, and death.

1233
01:15:23,716 --> 01:15:25,616
We'll need luck.

1234
01:15:25,616 --> 01:15:27,379
No such thing.

1235
01:15:33,723 --> 01:15:39,160
End-over-end kick,
coming down to number 34.

1236
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,896
He's at the 5, the 10, the 15.

1237
01:15:41,896 --> 01:15:44,090
The quick reverse to Johnny "0"!

1238
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:55,093
Touchdown!
Johnny "0", Bakersfield.

1239
01:15:59,241 --> 01:16:00,572
Had to be Johnny "0".

1240
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:04,878
You lucky son of a bitch!

1241
01:16:04,878 --> 01:16:07,402
Swing it, swing it, swing it, yeah!

1242
01:16:11,049 --> 01:16:13,380
What did that take?
Four seconds?

1243
01:16:14,385 --> 01:16:15,646
Nail them!

1244
01:16:16,486 --> 01:16:19,852
The kick is good.
Bakersfield 7, Taft 0.

1245
01:16:20,322 --> 01:16:22,688
- You a Rocket or a pissant?
- I'm a Rocket

1246
01:16:28,728 --> 01:16:31,457
God damn it!
Come back here!

1247
01:16:40,237 --> 01:16:43,206
I don't want to
sound biased, Arturo,

1248
01:16:43,206 --> 01:16:47,909
but that's a lean, green war machine
down there on the field.

1249
01:16:47,909 --> 01:16:50,010
Let's see what kind
of shape you're in.

1250
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:52,179
Quick pitch to Luther on 1.
Ready?

1251
01:16:52,179 --> 01:16:53,714
You a Rocket or a pissant?

1252
01:16:53,714 --> 01:16:55,373
- I'm a Rocket!
- Show me!

1253
01:16:57,049 --> 01:16:59,118
Set! Hut!

1254
01:16:59,118 --> 01:17:01,347
Pitch to Luther Jackson.

1255
01:17:02,587 --> 01:17:03,918
He's down at the 5.

1256
01:17:07,056 --> 01:17:09,853
Same play, other side.
0n 1, Ready. Break!

1257
01:17:10,992 --> 01:17:12,788
Set! Hut!

1258
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,926
Luther Jackson down at the 2.

1259
01:17:19,197 --> 01:17:20,824
It's like playing my sister.

1260
01:17:21,967 --> 01:17:24,069
3rd and 18.

1261
01:17:24,069 --> 01:17:26,369
I love this game.

1262
01:17:26,369 --> 01:17:29,439
Luther, split right,
run a straight fly.

1263
01:17:29,439 --> 01:17:31,373
Jack, post pattern on 4.

1264
01:17:31,373 --> 01:17:32,708
Be careful,
Dr. Death is covering you.

1265
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:35,042
- No sweat.
- I thought he was in jail.

1266
01:17:35,042 --> 01:17:37,043
No, he's on parole.

1267
01:17:37,043 --> 01:17:38,874
0n 4. Ready? Break!

1268
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:44,816
I'm going to take your teeth out.

1269
01:17:44,816 --> 01:17:46,718
Yeah!

1270
01:17:46,718 --> 01:17:48,652
0n 4.

1271
01:17:48,652 --> 01:17:50,711
0pen your eyes, punk!

1272
01:17:53,257 --> 01:17:54,358
Set!

1273
01:17:54,358 --> 01:17:55,618
0n 4.

1274
01:17:57,325 --> 01:17:59,594
Come on back here.
Wait for the ball.

1275
01:17:59,594 --> 01:18:01,788
I'm open!

1276
01:18:02,663 --> 01:18:04,358
Come on!

1277
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:09,467
Illegal procedure on number 99,
Jack Dundee.

1278
01:18:09,467 --> 01:18:12,526
Great move, Jack.
You're wide open.

1279
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:33,750
6 points.

1280
01:18:39,088 --> 01:18:41,291
Great start, huh, Jack?

1281
01:18:41,291 --> 01:18:44,725
In the first quarter,
Taft 0, Bakersfield 13.

1282
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,024
Johnny "0".
Key on "0"!

1283
01:18:50,263 --> 01:18:52,891
Look at this, guys!
Here it is!

1284
01:18:56,467 --> 01:19:01,130
The score is Bakersfield 20,
Taft nothing.

1285
01:19:03,907 --> 01:19:05,271
Kill somebody!

1286
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:09,904
Incomplete pass from Hightower.

1287
01:19:20,751 --> 01:19:24,187
Hightower thrown for
a loss of 12 yards.

1288
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:29,680
Ready?

1289
01:19:31,025 --> 01:19:32,492
Set!

1290
01:19:46,103 --> 01:19:47,798
[Thunder]

1291
01:19:56,777 --> 01:19:59,313
A long pass to Johnny "0"

1292
01:19:59,313 --> 01:20:01,615
at the 30, 25, 20...

1293
01:20:01,615 --> 01:20:03,149
Touchdown!

1294
01:20:03,149 --> 01:20:04,883
Johnny "o" of Bakersfield.

1295
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:07,783
I love it!
Give me a high five!

1296
01:20:10,053 --> 01:20:12,288
God, Morgan, my knee!

1297
01:20:12,288 --> 01:20:14,222
God damn it!

1298
01:20:14,222 --> 01:20:15,757
Jeez!

1299
01:20:15,757 --> 01:20:18,026
Is there a doctor in the house?

1300
01:20:18,026 --> 01:20:19,627
We're coming.

1301
01:20:19,627 --> 01:20:21,495
0h, shit!

1302
01:20:21,495 --> 01:20:22,462
Call my mom.

1303
01:20:24,529 --> 01:20:26,429
Watch my knee.

1304
01:20:29,134 --> 01:20:31,202
Taft 0, Bakersfield 26.

1305
01:20:31,202 --> 01:20:32,794
[Thunder]

1306
01:20:34,337 --> 01:20:37,840
Something's happening to
the blue-grey November sky.

1307
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,409
There seems to be some turbulence.

1308
01:20:40,409 --> 01:20:42,968
20 seconds left
in the first half.

1309
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:13,732
It's half time now.

1310
01:21:13,732 --> 01:21:16,757
It's starting to get
a bit of a Taft sprinkle.

1311
01:21:17,769 --> 01:21:19,369
Let's get out of here.

1312
01:21:19,369 --> 01:21:23,674
Half time statistics, rushing yardage...
Bakersfield 314 yards,

1313
01:21:23,674 --> 01:21:25,740
Taft minus 12.

1314
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:27,375
The weather sucks.

1315
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:30,110
We have a great half-time show.

1316
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:33,602
Listen to that great
Rocket band.

1317
01:21:53,529 --> 01:21:56,663
Sorry. Some great passes.
Should have had them.

1318
01:21:56,663 --> 01:21:58,290
Forget it.

1319
01:22:19,546 --> 01:22:22,515
Matthew 14, verse 11.

1320
01:22:22,515 --> 01:22:27,218
"Ye shall know the truth,
and it shall make you free."

1321
01:22:27,218 --> 01:22:28,920
Amen, coach!

1322
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,822
0n Monday morning,
they'll still be them,

1323
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:33,889
and we'll still be us,

1324
01:22:33,889 --> 01:22:41,029
but for the next 30 minutes,
we can rule Kern County!

1325
01:22:41,029 --> 01:22:42,689
Yay!

1326
01:22:45,031 --> 01:22:48,133
Gentlemen, now!

1327
01:22:48,133 --> 01:22:50,067
Now! Now!

1328
01:22:51,203 --> 01:22:53,770
Now we play some football!

1329
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:55,101
Yay!

1330
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:14,313
That ought to keep them
going through the kickoff.

1331
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:20,822
They say a little of this stuff
warms the body and clouds the mind.

1332
01:23:23,493 --> 01:23:25,860
That stuff runs right through you.

1333
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:28,462
Better go drain the weasel.

1334
01:23:28,462 --> 01:23:32,599
Come on, Ren, have a drink.
We're on a sinking ship.

1335
01:23:32,599 --> 01:23:35,434
The only way to do that
with dignity is to be drunk.

1336
01:23:35,434 --> 01:23:37,869
It's easy for you, isn't it?

1337
01:23:37,869 --> 01:23:40,972
You stunk 13 years ago,
and you stink tonight.

1338
01:23:40,972 --> 01:23:42,939
You haven't lost
a god damn thing.

1339
01:23:42,939 --> 01:23:46,342
This frigging nightmare
is all mine now.

1340
01:23:46,342 --> 01:23:49,878
It's all my fault.
Have a drink.

1341
01:23:49,878 --> 01:23:51,713
It's not your fault.

1342
01:23:51,713 --> 01:23:54,213
0h, yes, it is.

1343
01:23:54,213 --> 01:23:56,909
Have a god damn drink and relax!

1344
01:24:17,497 --> 01:24:19,265
You.

1345
01:24:19,265 --> 01:24:20,933
0h, my god!

1346
01:24:20,933 --> 01:24:21,934
That was you.

1347
01:24:21,934 --> 01:24:24,601
I forgot...
who put that there?

1348
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:27,604
- You don't think l...
- I ought to kill you!

1349
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:29,605
Reno, I was framed.

1350
01:24:29,605 --> 01:24:31,505
Framed, my ass!

1351
01:24:33,642 --> 01:24:35,802
God damn it!

1352
01:24:37,178 --> 01:24:40,815
You started this disaster,
and you're going to finish it.

1353
01:24:40,815 --> 01:24:44,544
You quarterback next half,
and they'll kill you.

1354
01:24:46,051 --> 01:24:49,086
You know what will be
on your tombstone?

1355
01:24:49,086 --> 01:24:54,323
Jack Dundee tried to remake history
and got beat 100 to nothing.

1356
01:24:54,323 --> 01:24:56,725
They won't score
that many points.

1357
01:24:56,725 --> 01:24:58,818
They might score 200,
but who cares?

1358
01:25:03,997 --> 01:25:08,228
There you go.
What do you got to say now?

1359
01:25:10,268 --> 01:25:11,969
You're right.

1360
01:25:11,969 --> 01:25:15,638
You're not a
quarterback anymore, Reno.

1361
01:25:15,638 --> 01:25:17,706
You're just a van specialist.

1362
01:25:17,706 --> 01:25:21,699
I shouldn't have expected you
to lift a town out of lethargy.

1363
01:25:23,312 --> 01:25:25,612
I was wrong to think
you were still a leader

1364
01:25:25,612 --> 01:25:30,282
because you've lost it,
not just in football, in life.

1365
01:25:30,282 --> 01:25:33,918
There, I've said it.
I'm sorry.

1366
01:25:33,918 --> 01:25:35,885
Now I'm ready to die.

1367
01:25:39,690 --> 01:25:42,291
Two minutes left to kickoff.

1368
01:25:42,291 --> 01:25:44,726
Time for my last smoke.

1369
01:25:44,726 --> 01:25:47,262
You lazy jive ass!

1370
01:25:47,262 --> 01:25:50,798
You're soft, you're slow,
and your hands are for shit.

1371
01:25:50,798 --> 01:25:53,167
Who woke you up?

1372
01:25:53,167 --> 01:25:55,963
Get on the field and shut up.

1373
01:25:57,736 --> 01:25:59,604
You're a prick.

1374
01:25:59,604 --> 01:26:02,139
You always were a prick.

1375
01:26:02,139 --> 01:26:04,766
Great, great.
Get your ass on the field.

1376
01:26:07,276 --> 01:26:08,765
Now.

1377
01:26:25,154 --> 01:26:26,756
When he was a prick,

1378
01:26:26,756 --> 01:26:28,825
Reno hightower was
the greatest quarterback

1379
01:26:28,825 --> 01:26:30,917
in the history of south
Kern County.

1380
01:26:32,427 --> 01:26:34,395
0ne more thing, Jack.

1381
01:26:34,395 --> 01:26:38,228
You ain't playing in the second half.
You're through.

1382
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,463
Damn you. Reno!

1383
01:26:48,839 --> 01:26:50,340
H0ME

1384
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:51,307
GUESTS

1385
01:27:07,819 --> 01:27:11,810
Whoa, nellie!
He's wearing his white shoes.

1386
01:27:16,859 --> 01:27:18,189
My god!

1387
01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:24,389
[Crowd chants Reno!]

1388
01:27:28,801 --> 01:27:30,358
Unbelievable!

1389
01:27:32,837 --> 01:27:35,633
The crowd's going wild.

1390
01:27:42,477 --> 01:27:43,909
[Whistle blows]

1391
01:27:53,184 --> 01:27:54,617
Let's go!

1392
01:27:59,389 --> 01:28:01,658
0n the sidelines,
the late arrival is Jack Dundee.

1393
01:28:01,658 --> 01:28:02,920
Right there.

1394
01:28:13,532 --> 01:28:14,965
1st down.

1395
01:28:17,001 --> 01:28:18,798
I'll kick your butt.

1396
01:28:26,542 --> 01:28:28,744
Complete to Luther Jackson
at the Bakersfield 34.

1397
01:28:28,744 --> 01:28:31,613
What the hell's happening?

1398
01:28:31,613 --> 01:28:33,739
Let's get something moving.

1399
01:28:34,781 --> 01:28:36,315
Great catch!

1400
01:28:36,315 --> 01:28:39,552
That's what you're supposed to do
when the ball hits you in the hands.

1401
01:28:39,552 --> 01:28:41,286
I want some protection
from you lazy bastards.

1402
01:28:41,286 --> 01:28:43,220
I'm tired of picking myself
up off the ground.

1403
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:45,051
Play-action pass to Luther.

1404
01:28:49,292 --> 01:28:50,460
Bring it on, chum.

1405
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:52,128
Let's go!

1406
01:28:52,128 --> 01:28:53,286
Your mama.

1407
01:29:45,599 --> 01:29:47,759
Wipe that stupid grin
off your face.

1408
01:29:53,837 --> 01:29:56,863
Third quarter Taft 14,
Bakersfield 26.

1409
01:30:00,076 --> 01:30:02,045
I've got hot nuts.

1410
01:30:02,045 --> 01:30:05,410
You ain't had hot nuts
in fifty years.

1411
01:30:23,925 --> 01:30:25,126
What's happening?

1412
01:30:25,126 --> 01:30:26,718
7:36 left to play.

1413
01:31:30,741 --> 01:31:32,842
Great second half, Ren.

1414
01:31:32,842 --> 01:31:35,674
Good thing I'm not in there, huh?

1415
01:31:38,279 --> 01:31:41,975
Did you think I'd never
find out who trashed Gigi?

1416
01:31:42,815 --> 01:31:46,012
0nly a fool would bring that
tiger's head in the locker room.

1417
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:49,855
I'm a genius at making
a fool of myself.

1418
01:31:49,855 --> 01:31:52,157
Always finding new ways to do it.

1419
01:31:52,157 --> 01:31:54,257
I got one more for you, Jack.

1420
01:31:54,257 --> 01:31:57,556
We get the ball back,
you're in there.

1421
01:31:59,495 --> 01:32:01,396
Why me?

1422
01:32:01,396 --> 01:32:03,386
Let's go, Bummer!

1423
01:32:05,599 --> 01:32:07,800
1st and 10 at the Taft 42.

1424
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,927
1:00 left in the game.

1425
01:32:11,035 --> 01:32:13,298
Just hold on to the ball.

1426
01:32:15,172 --> 01:32:17,230
The ball comes loose!
It's a fumble!

1427
01:32:19,575 --> 01:32:21,236
Who's got the ball?

1428
01:32:30,917 --> 01:32:32,508
Who's recovered the fumble?

1429
01:32:33,318 --> 01:32:34,784
Back off! It's our ball.

1430
01:32:41,224 --> 01:32:45,592
Taft recovered the ball
at their own 5 yard line.

1431
01:32:47,796 --> 01:32:49,559
Lucky bastard!

1432
01:32:51,966 --> 01:32:53,766
Let's go, Jack!

1433
01:32:53,766 --> 01:32:55,301
Where?

1434
01:32:55,301 --> 01:32:57,269
All right!
Go get them, baby.

1435
01:33:01,206 --> 01:33:02,673
0h, shit.

1436
01:33:02,673 --> 01:33:05,708
Number 99, Jack Dundee,
is going in for Taft.

1437
01:33:05,708 --> 01:33:07,368
Boo!

1438
01:33:09,778 --> 01:33:13,337
Get out of bounds.
Anybody screws up, I'll kill you.

1439
01:33:15,482 --> 01:33:17,039
Relax.

1440
01:33:17,983 --> 01:33:20,386
Reno up to the line.

1441
01:33:20,386 --> 01:33:23,153
Dundee flanked to the left.

1442
01:33:23,153 --> 01:33:25,055
They let you back in the game?

1443
01:33:25,055 --> 01:33:26,657
They've got to be kidding.

1444
01:33:26,657 --> 01:33:29,792
Where are your glasses,
Casper the friendly ghost?

1445
01:33:29,792 --> 01:33:31,494
You see that?

1446
01:33:31,494 --> 01:33:33,695
0h, yeah.
Watch out.

1447
01:33:33,695 --> 01:33:37,164
I'm pretty damn fast
for a Caucasian.

1448
01:33:37,164 --> 01:33:38,597
Hut!

1449
01:33:46,938 --> 01:33:49,406
And he's out of bounds at the 30.

1450
01:33:52,842 --> 01:33:54,275
49 seconds left.

1451
01:33:56,078 --> 01:33:57,880
I thought I broke your back.

1452
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:00,148
Want some more medicine?

1453
01:34:00,148 --> 01:34:01,115
Hut!

1454
01:34:07,986 --> 01:34:09,817
Now on the 45.

1455
01:34:29,201 --> 01:34:32,670
Carlos down at the 50.
The clock's running.

1456
01:34:32,670 --> 01:34:34,728
Taft has one time-out.

1457
01:34:35,239 --> 01:34:36,807
Hurry-up offense.

1458
01:34:36,807 --> 01:34:37,865
Let's go.

1459
01:34:52,684 --> 01:34:54,920
Reno Hightower sacked
for a big loss.

1460
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:57,689
Time-out! Time!

1461
01:34:57,689 --> 01:34:58,848
Time-out, Taft.

1462
01:35:04,293 --> 01:35:06,962
We got time for one more.

1463
01:35:06,962 --> 01:35:09,063
I can get open.

1464
01:35:09,063 --> 01:35:10,797
He can't get open.

1465
01:35:10,797 --> 01:35:12,932
I can get open.

1466
01:35:12,932 --> 01:35:14,524
Come here, Jack.

1467
01:35:24,774 --> 01:35:28,210
Half these people came
to watch you catch the ball.

1468
01:35:28,210 --> 01:35:32,013
The other half came
to see you drop it.

1469
01:35:32,013 --> 01:35:35,382
I was going to throw it to you,
but I want to win.

1470
01:35:35,382 --> 01:35:38,840
- I'm calling someone else.
- I can get open.

1471
01:35:40,653 --> 01:35:44,055
You drop that again,
your life is over.

1472
01:35:44,055 --> 01:35:46,522
Just throw me the ball.

1473
01:35:52,227 --> 01:35:54,286
Can you get open?

1474
01:36:03,002 --> 01:36:06,505
We are Taft!
We are Taft!

1475
01:36:06,505 --> 01:36:08,233
We are Taft!

1476
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:12,641
0lin, this stick is you.

1477
01:36:12,641 --> 01:36:14,843
Eddie, you're the bottle cap.

1478
01:36:14,843 --> 01:36:17,378
Take care of that maniac
coming from the right side.

1479
01:36:17,378 --> 01:36:19,881
Chico, block and flare.

1480
01:36:19,881 --> 01:36:24,116
Head for the water bucket
and cut toward the gym.

1481
01:36:24,116 --> 01:36:26,819
Jack, give them your best move.

1482
01:36:26,819 --> 01:36:28,513
My best move.

1483
01:36:29,888 --> 01:36:31,089
You ready?

1484
01:36:31,089 --> 01:36:32,189
Ready.

1485
01:36:32,189 --> 01:36:34,088
0n 2. Ready? Break!

1486
01:36:41,330 --> 01:36:43,364
You're not giving it
to Jack are you?

1487
01:36:43,364 --> 01:36:45,025
You think I'm crazy?

1488
01:36:57,475 --> 01:37:00,143
At their own 45.
No time-outs left.

1489
01:37:00,143 --> 01:37:02,076
Five seconds left on the clock.

1490
01:37:03,979 --> 01:37:05,981
This is it, Jack.

1491
01:37:05,981 --> 01:37:07,538
Throw it to Jack!

1492
01:37:09,749 --> 01:37:11,551
Last play.

1493
01:37:11,551 --> 01:37:13,352
Ready!

1494
01:37:13,352 --> 01:37:15,720
Death, humiliation, and pain.

1495
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:18,022
You ready for this, Dundee?

1496
01:37:18,022 --> 01:37:19,223
Come and get me, sucker.

1497
01:37:19,223 --> 01:37:20,622
Set!

1498
01:37:21,790 --> 01:37:23,417
[Crowd quiets]

1499
01:38:40,481 --> 01:38:42,505
Touchdown!

1500
01:39:27,382 --> 01:39:29,083
How are your legs?

1501
01:39:29,083 --> 01:39:30,710
My knees are killing me.

1502
01:39:31,851 --> 01:39:33,752
They feel great.

1503
01:39:33,752 --> 01:39:37,085
God, I love to watch you play.

1504
01:39:54,434 --> 01:39:56,002
I did it.

1505
01:39:56,002 --> 01:39:57,525
Nice catch.

1506
01:39:59,038 --> 01:40:01,240
I was so lucky.

1507
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:04,708
No. No, you were due.

1508
01:40:04,708 --> 01:40:06,709
Hey, Jack!

1509
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:09,911
I challenge you
to a rematch next year.

1510
01:40:09,911 --> 01:40:11,479
0n astroturf.

1511
01:40:11,479 --> 01:40:12,946
Look out!

1512
01:40:14,215 --> 01:40:15,915
Damn it.

1513
01:40:15,915 --> 01:40:17,439
Let's go home.

1514
01:40:22,353 --> 01:40:25,089
How did that clown
ever catch the ball?

1515
01:40:25,089 --> 01:40:27,091
Clown?

1516
01:40:27,091 --> 01:40:29,626
Did you see that great move?

1517
01:40:29,626 --> 01:40:31,616
That's my son-in-law.

1518
01:40:32,628 --> 01:40:34,424
Hey, 99!

1519
01:40:36,231 --> 01:40:37,789
Nice catch.

1520
01:40:38,305 --> 01:40:44,660
