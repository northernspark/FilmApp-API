00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,324
- I swear, if'n you don't
learn to share this honey...

3
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,594
<i>I'm gonna give you a real whupping</i>

4
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:45,967
Now go on!

5
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:03,355
<i>- Is the doctor in?
- No doubt about it.</i>

6
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:07,415
- What's ailin' ya, Fat Elmer?
- I et too much cheese.

7
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,427
Now I can't burp.

8
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,897
Can ya fix me, Granny?

9
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:06,049
<i>Dang.</i>

10
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:28,260
Before I sign anything...

11
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,802
I want to know how much money
we're talkin' about.

12
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,803
Mr. Clampett, there's more petroleum
in your swamp...

13
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,635
than there is in all of Kuwait.

14
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,903
- That bad, huh?
- Mr. Clampett...

15
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:43,449
you are sitting on the biggest
domestic oil strike in history.

16
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:47,451
<i>And when you sign these contracts,
we're going to pay you one billion dollars.</i>

17
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,956
Do you have anybody
who can advise you on these contracts?

18
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,892
<i>Cousin jethro's a-comin'tomorrow night
for Sunday supper, Pa.</i>

19
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:01,160
He's the one with the learnin'.
He went to school at Oxford.

20
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,049
- Jethro.
- Yes, Ma?

21
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,414
Did you fix those bare-as-bones brakes
like I told you?

22
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,420
Of course.
I pulled 'em off yesterday.

23
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,650
The new ones are
comin' in the mail next week.

24
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,940
- Jethro!
- Howdy, Granny.

25
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:46,500
Oh! You dadblamed
simpleminded yahoo!

26
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:50,104
Your crack-bucket head's
emptier than last year's bird's nest.

27
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,980
If your head was filled with dynamite...

28
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,986
- Ow! Ow!
- You wouldn't know how to blow your nose!

29
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,079
- You...
- Ow!

30
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,215
- Granny! Ow! Granny!
- Just get out of my sight!

31
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,892
<i>Now, jedediah...</i>

32
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,396
you're fixin' to be the richest man
in this here county.

33
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:11,801
Look at how you live. Why, your land's
overrun with snakes and skunks.

34
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:15,237
<i>You got no TV, no telephone and no radio.</i>

35
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:20,804
<i>You're right, Pearl.
We are a-livin'in paradise.</i>

36
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,405
No, Jed!
Paradise is someplace like...

37
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,417
Beverly Hills, Californy.

38
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,079
<i>- They got swimmin'pools.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

39
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,486
- And movie stars.
- And smog.

40
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,560
What's a smog?

41
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,263
I reckon it's a small hog.

42
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,096
<i>Now, if you're not gonna think about yourself,
think about your daughter.</i>

43
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,403
<i>You need to get remarried, jed,
and she needs a ma...</i>

44
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,740
someone to teach her
womanly ways.

45
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:57,407
<i>- She's runnin'wild, jed.
She's no different than a boy.</i>

46
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:01,613
<i>Imagine that. Elly May
wearin'fancy dresses...</i>

47
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,588
and actin' ladylike!

48
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,149
<i>Well, that don't sound like much fun.</i>

49
00:07:13,264 --> 00:07:15,462
<i>Beverly Hills.</i>

50
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,798
<i>Listen to what I'm saying jed.</i>

51
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,374
<i>It would be the best thing for y'all.</i>

52
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,911
<i>Just pack up all your belongin's
and move on out there.</i>

53
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,948
<i>Jethro could drive you out
in his truck.</i>

54
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,883
I ain't drivin' in no movin' vehicle
with no dunderhead.

55
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,011
<i>I ain't no dunderhead.</i>

56
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,326
- Come on! Put me down!
- Set him down.

57
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:48,325
<i>- See what I mean?
- Who are you, mister?</i>

58
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,665
Ozark Mountain Oil. Mr. Briggs sent me
to see if you'd signed the contract.

59
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,664
- Oh, my.
- Elly May Clampett.

60
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,572
Well, that's it.

61
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,645
I've made my decision.

62
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,845
For the good
of this here family...

63
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,009
I'm a-movin' us to Beverly Hills.

64
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:12,218
Now, don't you worry, Elly May.

65
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,558
We gonna take good care of your critters for ya.

66
00:08:15,558 --> 00:08:17,558
Okay, Sam. I know you will.

67
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,825
Oh, Ma!

68
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:32,103
What's all this I hear about you
not wantin' to go to Californy?

69
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,541
I like it here.
Say what you will...

70
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:38,278
but there ain't nothin' you can do
to get me off of this rockin' chair.

71
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,947
<i>- I ain't goin' nowheres! Cut me loose!
- It's a long ride to Californy.</i>

72
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:46,081
<i>Jedediah Clampett, I'm gonna skin you alive!</i>

73
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,752
Hush up, Granny.

74
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,954
Get goin', boy,
before she breaks loose.

75
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,928
<i>I ain't a-going!</i>

76
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,318
Watch your head, Granny.

77
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:37,073
There's so many people
in this here town.

78
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,775
<i>Goin' to take a long time to meet everybody.</i>

79
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,781
Hey! Nice wheels, buddy!

80
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:49,150
- Jethro, why do you think
that feller's pointin' at us?

81
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,452
I reckon that's the way
they wave "howdy" in Californy.

82
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,629
<i>- Has, uh...
- Uh.! Excuse us.!</i>

83
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,757
Has escrow closed
on the Clampett estate?

84
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:05,300
Yes, chief. With an offer
of 22 million in cash, it closed swiftly.

85
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,204
And I must say,
it is inspirational...

86
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,239
how you happened to find a place
for the Clampetts right next-door to your own.

87
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,242
Hathaway, the people
who lived there...

88
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,838
were my best friends and neighbors
for over 20 years.

89
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,881
It's a shame they had
to file for bankruptcy.

90
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:22,748
Yeah. I just hope my call to the I.R.S.
didn't have anything to do with it. Well.

91
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,859
- Now, um, what time does their fight arrive?
- That's just it, chief.

92
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,023
<i>- They're driving.
- Driving?</i>

93
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,794
From Arkansas?

94
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,131
I know it makes no sense whatsoever.

95
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,535
Not to you, perhaps.

96
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,870
But to a man with vision,
like myself...

97
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:48,078
- That is a sign of daring, self-confidence, vigor.
- Of course, chief.

98
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,347
<i>Hmm. Doesn't he look busy at work.</i>

99
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,545
Tyler.

100
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,818
- Would you step in here for a moment, please.
- Oh!

101
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,760
<i>- Geez.
- It's an earthquake.!</i>

102
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,892
<i>Oh.</i>

103
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:26,680
- You wanted to consult with me?
- Sit down, Tyler. Relax.

104
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,782
I have heard that you are quite excited
about the arrival of the Clampetts.

105
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,519
I think that you and I,
together...

106
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:39,323
can fully exploit the potential
of the Clampett financial portfolio.

107
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:40,391
Hmm.

108
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,765
You and I. The two of us.

109
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,896
I've already taken the liberty of drawing up
the power of attorney papers.

110
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:51,602
- Have you now?
- So I can write checks, arrange investments...

111
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,872
<i>make international transactions.</i>

112
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,573
- Really work the Clampett account.
- Hmm.

113
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,206
We'll be quite the team, sir.

114
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,478
Mmm.

115
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,389
Tyler, you will personally
rescind, shred and burn...

116
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,258
every paper you have drawn up
with regard to the Clampett account.

117
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:13,389
- I'll be handling that account personally.
- Duly noted.

118
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,260
And nice kick, sir.

119
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,793
<i>Took me completely by surprise.</i>

120
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,139
Tyler.

121
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,802
- The Clampetts will not be badgered.
- Sir?

122
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,775
They are not your common
garden-variety millionaires.

123
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:32,649
<i>They are, in fact, billionaires.</i>

124
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:37,121
By definition, people of,
uh, discrimination...

125
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,590
discernment, great refinement.

126
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,628
<i>Boy, howdy.!</i>

127
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,596
Hey! Jethro, we's supposed
to go that away.

128
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,972
<i>Hey! You cut us off, you bunch of nothin's!</i>

129
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,847
That's real nice, son.

130
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,855
This here's what I carry.

131
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,492
Okay. Go! Go, go!

132
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,099
<i>Margaret!</i>

133
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,404
Morgan, come in here
a minute, please.

134
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:30,838
<i>Hi. I'm Doug Llewelyn, and welcome
to the People's Court.</i>

135
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:32,342
<i>Where is your mother?</i>

136
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,412
She's changing.

137
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,913
That would be
too much to hope for.

138
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:40,110
- Oh.
- Milburn, I'm sorry. I have to cancel our lunch.

139
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,382
- What?    - I have to spend more
quality time with Babette.

140
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:48,722
Margaret, dear, we are trying to do more
things together, put the spark back, remember?

141
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,194
You claim the defendant
has your dog?

142
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,197
<i>- Um, well, actually...
- Yes or no?</i>

143
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,824
- Yes, we do. - Morgan.
Morgan. - It's my dog.

144
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:60,166
<i>- It's your dog?
- Yes. I raised this dog from a pup, and due to...</i>

145
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,740
Morgan, I have a little job for you.

146
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,746
- A job?
- Yes. J.D. Clampett has a daughter your age.

147
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,975
Now, she's goin'
to high school with you.

148
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,983
I want you
to show her around.

149
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,781
- Just be her friend.
- Oh, man.

150
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,322
You wanna pay me
to hang out with her?

151
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,655
She must be a major bowwow.

152
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,228
Son.

153
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,354
Morgan.

154
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,297
Close your eyes.

155
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,130
Close your eyes.

156
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,704
Now picture this.

157
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,705
I cut off your allowance...

158
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,707
Cancel your credit cards...

159
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,936
And delete you from my will.

160
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,070
Now, how do you see
your future?

161
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,809
Grilling frozen cow parts
at Burger King?

162
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,015
And people say you're stupid.

163
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,454
Monday morning,
first period, 8:00 a. M...

164
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,219
she'll be like the little sister
Mom thought would ruin her figure.

165
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,961
<i>- The dog will go to the plaintiff,
Rusty.</i>

166
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,284
Honey, I'm home.

167
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:31,788
Why don't you come here and give your little
embezzling cowboy a ride around bungalow.

168
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,491
- No.
- Why not?

169
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,298
'Cause I'm still living in this dump when I
should be living in a mansion in Beverly Hills.

170
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:41,134
Laura, sweetheart.

171
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,437
<i>Bungalows 3A, 3B and 3C
are in Los Angeles.</i>

172
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:48,035
<i>We live in 3G
which, technically, is in Beverly Hills.</i>

173
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,944
You're all talk, Tyler.

174
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,208
You said we'd have
enough money this month...

175
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,708
to buy me that little
baby sealskin coat.

176
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,153
- We will.
- Promises, promises.

177
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,157
<i>Sweetie, we will.</i>

178
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,695
<i>J.D. Clampett, the billionaire,
just opened up an account at the bank.</i>

179
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,889
Who is this Clampett guy?

180
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,466
If he's so rich, how come
I've never heard of him?

181
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:12,298
Baby cakes, this guy's got more money
than he knows what to do with.

182
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,498
Now, that's a problem
I think we can help him with.

183
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,412
Stop the car, Jethro!

184
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,915
They's a fresh kill in the road.

185
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,178
- Can't just leave it there.
- You're right, Granny.

186
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:30,511
Roadkill stew sounds
mighty good right now.

187
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,984
Oh, no, you don't, you old coot! I seen it first!

188
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,586
<i>- Milburn, call Westec Security.
- Well, I...</i>

189
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,688
I'm sure there's enough for us all.

190
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,529
Eww! How revolting.

191
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:46,695
<i>Easy now, Granny.
They're probably just bein' neighborly...</i>

192
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,740
like them nice folks we met
on that extry-wide road.

193
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,506
Well, let's give 'em
a Californy howdy.

194
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:56,105
<i>- Howdy, y'all.!
- Howdy.!</i>

195
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,184
Milburn!

196
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,252
Did you fip me off?

197
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,149
You reckon we're at
the wrong spot, Uncle Jed?

198
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,160
<i>Could be. Don't know.</i>

199
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,890
It's the right address, Pa.

200
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,390
Whee doggies!

201
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,267
<i>The whole place looks brand-new.</i>

202
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,872
Hey, Uncle Jed, there's
a whole 'nother house up here.

203
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,554
<i>This is a big ol'house.</i>

204
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:46,180
Why do you reckon
they got two sets of steps?

205
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,384
That's easy.

206
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,894
One's for goin' up.
The other's for goin' down.

207
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,055
Oh.

208
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,766
What a pretty critter.

209
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,170
Hello, police?
This is Miss Jane Hathaway.

210
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,241
I wish to report
the unlawful entry...

211
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,070
of a gang of armed and dangerous
hooligans at the Clampett estate.

212
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,842
518 Crestview Drive.

213
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:13,680
I need you here code three,
and I will be timing you.

214
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,652
I think you got you
a new friend, Duke.

215
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,550
<i>Cease and desist.!
Everyone.!</i>

216
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,924
If I were you, sir,
I would yield, submit and capitulate.

217
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,728
<i>What are you desperadoes
doing here?</i>

218
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,565
- Well, it's a mighty long story.
- But he don't mind tellin' it.

219
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,534
- Pa was a-huntin' one day with old Duke.
- Duke spotted this jack rabbit.

220
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:40,036
- So I throws up my gun, and I takes my aim...
- Don't shoot!

221
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,511
<i>Pardon, ma'am?</i>

222
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,484
<i>Two minutes and 46 seconds.</i>

223
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:55,083
<i>Go.! Go.! Go.!</i>

224
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,462
<i>I need three men
over there on the south side.!</i>

225
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,094
<i>Attention, inside.!
You're surrounded.!</i>

226
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,968
<i>Drop your weapons
and file out one at a time.!</i>

227
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:11,634
<i>- Don't shoot! Oh! They've taken me hostage!
- Attention, inside.!</i>

228
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:15,144
Drop your weapons
and file out one at a time!

229
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,374
<i>This is the Beverly Hills
Police Department.</i>

230
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,382
Told you this warn't no house.

231
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:23,045
<i>- You heard him. It's the police department.
- This is your last warning.!</i>

232
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,056
All right!
Fire one in!

233
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,793
<i>Look.</i>

234
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,556
They's a-playin' kick the can.

235
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:48,012
Move in!

236
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:54,584
I knew we shouldn't have never left home.
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!

237
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,655
Right this way.
We've I.D. 'd them all.

238
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:01,557
- Excellent.
- We want the wheels of justice to spin quickly.

239
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,920
<i>These criminals must be
prosecuted and incarcerated...</i>

240
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,929
before our client finds out
what happened.

241
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,422
Exactly.

242
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,332
The reputation of Milburn Drysdale is at stake.

243
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,064
Would everyone turn
to the right, please.

244
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,868
<i>Huh.! Hmm.! Pathetic.</i>

245
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:22,205
Now we have, starting on the left,
a Jedediah Clampett.

246
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,305
- Then, next to him, his daughter, Elly May.
- Huh?

247
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:28,443
<i>And a Daisy Mae Moses, a. k. a. "Granny. "</i>

248
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,615
<i>And a nephew, jethro Bodine.</i>

249
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,689
<i>And some woman involved in a drive-by slapping.</i>

250
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,400
Oh, chief. Chief. Are you okay?

251
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,332
Chief. Quickly! Say something!

252
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:48,533
Say something!

253
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,003
You're fired!

254
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:57,409
Mr. Clampett, sir!
I am deeply sorry...

255
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,351
for any embarrassment
my former assistant might have caused you.

256
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:03,321
- I... I...
- Yes, sir. I... I...

257
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:06,084
I- I humbly apologize
for my egregious error.

258
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,250
<i>And rest assured
that it will never happen again...</i>

259
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,328
as I am no longer
in the employ of the bank.

260
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,762
Chief, Mr. Drysdale,
I will clean out my desk at once.

261
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:19,030
<i>Oh, dear.! Oh, please,
don't trouble yourselves.</i>

262
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,196
Please, gentlemen. Oh. Oh, thank you.
Don't trouble yourselves.

263
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:24,332
Oh, I'm... Thank you. Thank you so much.
Oh, thank... No.

264
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,974
So, then everything is fine?

265
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:32,847
Mr. Clampett, please don't
take your money from my bank.

266
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:37,251
I'll do anything you want.
I'll contribute to charities, anything.

267
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,790
I'll eat mud.

268
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,859
That won't be necessary.

269
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,726
All I want is for this here lady
to watch over my affairs.

270
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:49,731
Me? You want me?

271
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,196
Well, I reckon
you done what you done...

272
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:54,563
'cause you didn't know
we was who we was.

273
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,607
And if we hadn't have been
who we was...

274
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,768
we'd have still been much obliged
for you a-doin' what you done.

275
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:04,812
Mr. Clampett, I will work
very hard for you.

276
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,781
I trust you will.

277
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,445
<i>Is that all right with you,
Mr. Drysdale?</i>

278
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,681
That's exactly what I'd do
in your situation.

279
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,758
- So we got ourselves a deal.
- Ah!

280
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,894
Absolutely!

281
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,055
Yeah.

282
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,135
<i>Just to show you
there's no hard feelin's...</i>

283
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,762
<i>we'd like to invite you and your family
to Sunday supper.</i>

284
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:28,902
Thank you. We'll be there.

285
00:23:28,913 --> 00:23:31,702
It'll give me the opportunity to
swap recipes with your wife.

286
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,510
Oh, she'd love that.

287
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,950
<i>Here you go.</i>

288
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:46,847
- What-What are you doing?
- We're just payin' our respects.

289
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,119
- You...
- Oh.

290
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,718
Oh. Oh, no.
This is a limousine.

291
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,162
<i>You'll be going home in this.</i>

292
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,962
You take this, and I'll follow you
in my Rolls-Royce.

293
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,637
<i>- There you go.
- Is that your car?</i>

294
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,403
- Yes, it is.
- Ain't that fancy!

295
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,740
Can I drive it?

296
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:11,282
You drive my $180,000
Rolls-Royce?

297
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:17,712
Uh, well, of course you can, son.
I think that's a great idea.

298
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,222
Hot dog!

299
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,821
Howdy!

300
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:55,384
<i>Oh, isn't this exciting?</i>

301
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,894
Elly May Clampett,
sit down!

302
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,095
<i>Oh, excuse me.</i>

303
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,569
Hello.

304
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,267
Let Mr... Let Mr. Clampett know...

305
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,842
that the full weight of the bank
is ready to help them.

306
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:16,777
- Yes, chief.
- She thinks she's talkin' to somebody.

307
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:19,142
<i>Ain't even a cord there.</i>

308
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:25,721
Like real estate, bonds, securities.
Whatever it is he wants, it's his.

309
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:30,090
Mr. Drysdale wants you to know that the bank
is ready to help in any way that it can.

310
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,728
There's one reason and one reason only
I moved out here.

311
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,966
I'm lookin' to get hitched.

312
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,967
Chief, he says
he wants to get hitched.

313
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,039
- "Hitched"?
- Married.

314
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,200
- Married?
- Chief, that's what I said.

315
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:49,269
Miss Hathaway, if...
if Clampett wants a wife...

316
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,815
tell him that you will
personally find him one.

317
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:56,047
Oh, chief, capable as I may be,
matrimonial brokering is...

318
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,054
Is now one of your specialties.

319
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:01,250
Congratulations, Miss Hathaway,
and good luck.

320
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,696
Yes, sir.
Oh, dear.

321
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:09,289
No problem.
Uh, Mr. Clampett.

322
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:14,065
<i>Just exactly what
are you looking for in a fiancée?</i>

323
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:16,572
A "fiancée"?

324
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:19,667
<i>"Fiancée"is French
for the person you intend to marry.</i>

325
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:22,303
Well, I'm lookin'
for a refined lady...

326
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,008
<i>to help me
raise my daughter, Elly May.</i>

327
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,584
Aw, Pa,
I'm already raised up.

328
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:32,088
And refined.

329
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,125
- Ah.
- Elly May, don't spit from a movin' vehicle.

330
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,622
Wait till it stops.

331
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,537
<i>Jethro, save some for our guests.</i>

332
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,036
<i>Here you go, Uncle Jed.</i>

333
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,950
I think old Duke
is sweet on your critter.

334
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:05,955
<i>She's not a critter.
She's a champion French "Barbonet. "</i>

335
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:10,619
And her purebred puppies
are gonna be worth $3,000 each.

336
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,459
<i>Uh, son, what, uh...
What do you do?</i>

337
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,692
Don't know.
What do you do?

338
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,668
Oh, I'm just
president of a bank.

339
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,137
Wow. Uncle Jed, can I
be a president too?

340
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,700
Now, Jethro, that's a mighty disrespectful
thing to say to Mr. Drysdale.

341
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:30,508
- No.
- Ask him if you can be vice president.

342
00:27:33,615 --> 00:27:34,813
<i>Vice president.</i>

343
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,319
Uh-huh.

344
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:54,998
Vice president.
Mm-hmm. I think so.

345
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,233
We can... We can always use another good man.

346
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:02,211
<i>Hoo-whee. I'm gonna get me
a fancy office and a pretty secretary.</i>

347
00:28:05,313 --> 00:28:06,409
<i>There's them bells again.</i>

348
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:10,579
<i>Jethro, I bet you there's somebody
standin'at that front door right now.</i>

349
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,928
If I was you,
I'd eat real quick whilst he's gone.

350
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:22,125
Oh, that's good.
Margaret, why don't you help yourself, dear.

351
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,963
<i>- Oh, good Lord.
- What is it?</i>

352
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,635
- Howdy, mister.
- Hi. I'm Woodrow Tyler.

353
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:34,769
- I'm here to see Jed Clampett.
- Well, come on in.

354
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,182
No, no. No.

355
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,720
<i>- Tyler. Well, what brings you here?
- Sir, hello.</i>

356
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:51,558
<i>We took up a collection to buy these
beautiful flowers for our newest clients.</i>

357
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:54,063
Welcome to Beverly Hills.

358
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,258
<i>Well, thank you, sonny.</i>

359
00:28:56,367 --> 00:29:02,237
Tyler, can the ham. Just introduce yourself
and get out of here, okay?

360
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,434
- Very pleased to meet you.
- Howdy!

361
00:29:10,246 --> 00:29:12,080
Elly May Clampett!

362
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:15,152
<i>- He was fixin' to bite my hand.
- Well, stand him up.</i>

363
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:22,124
- Tyler, apologize.
- My fault completely, Mr. Clampett.

364
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:23,922
<i>I moved too quickly.</i>

365
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:28,520
You have a beautiful daughter...
and very strong.

366
00:29:28,632 --> 00:29:30,465
- Mrs. Drysdale.
- Hmm?

367
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:33,994
What could help Elly May
be as refined as you?

368
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:36,606
Well, I went to
finishing school in France.

369
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:41,008
<i>No one understands refinement and
sophistication better than the French.</i>

370
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:45,310
Hmm. Do you think we ought to
move ourselves to France?

371
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:48,112
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't. No, she doesn't.

372
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:52,711
Actually, you can find a good French tutor
that'll come right to your home.

373
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:56,455
<i>I don't wanna change.
I just wanna be who I am.</i>

374
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:59,621
<i>- And I ain't goin'to no France.!
- Oh, my.</i>

375
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,002
<i>Excuse me.</i>

376
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,095
- Mrs. Drysdale.
- Hmm?

377
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:08,038
<i>If you ain't gonna eat them vittles,
can I have 'em?</i>

378
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:12,540
<i>Of course you can, son.
Bon appétit.</i>

379
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,612
Thank you.

380
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:26,079
Elly May, come on down here.

381
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:34,587
<i>- How'd you know where I was, Pa?
- 'Cause ever since you could walk...</i>

382
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:37,759
you've been climbin' trees
and cuddlin' with your critters.

383
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,210
It's high time you started thinkin'
about changin' some things.

384
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:55,809
You need to start wearin' dresses
and fixin' up nice.

385
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,751
But, Pa,
folks would call me a sissy.

386
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,817
It ain't sissy for girls
to act like girls.

387
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:07,156
Ever since your ma died,
I done what I knew best...

388
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,199
and raised you up like a boy...

389
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,292
rough housin', fishin', fightin'.

390
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,997
Yeah. That stuff's fun.

391
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:19,834
Elly, nature made you a girl,
and here lately...

392
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,269
she's been gettin' more
and more positive about it.

393
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,780
Aw, Pa.

394
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:29,313
Every time
I look into your eyes...

395
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,320
I can see your ma there.

396
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,628
Was my ma refined?

397
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,721
Oh, yes.

398
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,266
She was a real genteel lady.

399
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:50,000
I miss her so much...
even now.

400
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,941
I wanna be
just like my ma was.

401
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,477
I reckon I do need somebody
to teach me the ways.

402
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,143
Yeah, reckon you do.

403
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:07,919
And now I got the means
to make that happen.

404
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:24,469
Tyler, don't you have anything
better to do today?

405
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:28,170
I just thought you'd wanna know more
about the richest dumb guy in America.

406
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:32,443
<i>- He's a hayseed, a hillbilly.
- Mm!</i>

407
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,609
<i>So this Clampett guy
should be easy, huh?</i>

408
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:38,177
Yes, but we better do it fast
before he gets married.

409
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,315
Married? Tyler,
Clampett's getting married?

410
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:44,862
No, but he wants to.

411
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,863
<i>- He's a horny old goat lookin' for some action?
- Nah.</i>

412
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,801
He's just looking for a refined lady...

413
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:56,533
<i>- to help raise his hellcat daughter, Elly May.
- Hmm.</i>

414
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,805
<i>But he did seem interested when somebody
brought up the idea of a French tutor.</i>

415
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:04,245
Hmm. A French tutor.

416
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:24,732
<i>Bonjour.
My name is Laurette Voleur...</i>

417
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,237
and I am a...
French governess.

418
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,569
<i>Well, come on in, ma'am.</i>

419
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,943
<i>Bonjour.
I am going door-to-door...</i>

420
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,711
to see if anyone
needs my services.

421
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,613
<i>- My business card.
- "Mademoiselle. "</i>

422
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:44,279
"Mademoiselle... "

423
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:48,189
- Sorry, ma'am. I don't think so.
- Are you sure?

424
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:55,956
- Yep.
- There is not a young woman in the house...

425
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,594
who is perhaps a bit, uh, unruly?

426
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:04,302
Not that I can think of,
but, then again, we just moved here.

427
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:08,970
Nobody in need of refinement
and sophistication?

428
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:15,542
No. Maybe you oughta
try the neighbors.

429
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:20,420
Oh, well, I am so sorry
to bother you.

430
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,426
<i>I will be going now.</i>

431
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:26,887
Well, what's the problem, ma'am?

432
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:31,935
I was just hoping that my services
would be needed, but...

433
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:35,301
- Well, what do you do?
- I teach, um... how do you say this...

434
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:41,476
oh, rambunctious teenage girls
how to be more ladylike and proper.

435
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:47,713
Well, dog my cats. You know,
Mrs. Drysdale was just telling us...

436
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:50,653
about how the French was the best
at finishing a gal out.

437
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,918
<i>Oui, they are. They are
the very, very best...</i>

438
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:57,859
<i>at making a woman a woman.</i>

439
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,829
Hey. I just thought of somethin'.

440
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,832
Maybe she could help
with Elly May.

441
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,494
Oh.

442
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,606
Here, Rascal.

443
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,874
Yeah.

444
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:21,383
You like swimmin'
in this cement pond, don't you?

445
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,750
<i>You like it too, Frankie?</i>

446
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,823
<i>Takin'that duck for a swim?</i>

447
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:33,224
And over here by the cement pond
is my daughter Elly.

448
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:35,322
Elly, say hello to Miss Laurette.

449
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,958
<i>- Howdy, Miss Laurette.
- Bonjour, Elly May.</i>

450
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,969
It is such a pleasure
to meet you.

451
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:42,171
I was thinkin',
every day after school...

452
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:45,042
<i>maybe Miss Laurette
could help teach you to be a lady.</i>

453
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,043
<i>- How about that?
- Okay.</i>

454
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,080
Spanky likes you.

455
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,809
Not as much as I like him.

456
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:58,422
<i>Go on, now,
and stay out of trouble.</i>

457
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,888
I finally figured
this game out, Spanky.

458
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,895
<i>You take this ball...</i>

459
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,057
you put it down
this here gully.

460
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,761
It rolls down yonder.

461
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:15,361
Then you hurl yourself
down this slippery gully...

462
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:19,341
and see how many of them there
snake-bashin' clubs...

463
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:23,601
you can knock down...
before the ball gets there.

464
00:36:26,348 --> 00:36:27,840
What a stupid idiot.

465
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:30,250
Did you say somethin', ma'am?

466
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:34,017
What a stupendous intellect.

467
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,320
That's 'cause I graduated
the sixth grade, ma'am.

468
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:38,696
<i>Only took three years.</i>

469
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:08,922
Now, Elly May,
sit straight, chin up...

470
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:13,486
and try to practice looking interested
when people are boring you.

471
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:25,574
<i>Ah, greetings, Mr. Clampett.</i>

472
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,644
<i>- Well, howdy, Miss Jane.
- Hello, Elly May.</i>

473
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,111
Miss Jane, this here
is Miss Laurette Voleur.

474
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:33,911
<i>Bonjour, Mademoiselle Laurette.
Comment allez-vous?</i>

475
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,919
Tut-tut-tut-tut-tut.

476
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:40,957
- I must only speak the English
in front of Elly May.   - Of course.

477
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:44,994
<i>Uh, Mr. Clampett, drawing
from Commerce Bank clientele...</i>

478
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,532
I have selected some preliminary
bridal prospects for you.

479
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:51,966
<i>Oh.! Oh, dear.! Oh, my goodness.!</i>

480
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:55,368
<i>Mon Dieu.!
How clumsy of me. I'm so sorry.</i>

481
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,703
Oh. Oh, it's no... no problem.

482
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:01,471
No problem whatsoever.
At the bank, I have these in triplicate.

483
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:06,039
- I shall return.
- I'll walk you out, Miss Hathaway.

484
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,050
Why, thank you, Jethro.

485
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:09,279
<i>So, Mr. Clampett...</i>

486
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:12,788
<i>perhaps we should discuss
my, uh, weekly salary?</i>

487
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,162
Shoo!

488
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,225
Shoo!

489
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:37,303
Shoo, cow. Excuse me, I'm just going to
reach over here and press this button.

490
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,406
Hello. Can anyone hear me?

491
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,985
Can anyone hear me?

492
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,748
- Yeah.
- Can somebody help me?

493
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:48,052
- Hello?
- Miss Hathaway?

494
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,060
How's it feel to live in Beverly Hills?

495
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,563
- Hello?
- I can hear you. Where are you?

496
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,725
Please, can somebody
let me out of here?

497
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,702
I am trapped inside the wall.

498
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,569
Hello? Hello?

499
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,268
<i>- Hello? Hello?
- Just stay put, Miss Hathaway. I'll get ya out.</i>

500
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:07,742
Hello?

501
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,846
Watch your head.

502
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,385
Miss Hathaway?

503
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,622
Yoo-hoo!

504
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:31,696
I'm in. This is gonna be
easier than I thought.

505
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:34,236
So, they bought the French thing?

506
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:37,035
<i>Mais oui.
They're bumpkins.</i>

507
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,109
It's a crime
they have so much money.

508
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,043
It's worse than a foreigner
winning the lottery.

509
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,478
I know exactly
what I'm gonna do.

510
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,574
First, I'll lure in Clampett.
That'll be easy.

511
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:52,281
Next, I'll take Elly May
and slap on a little window dressing.

512
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,791
Make him think I turned her into a real lady.

513
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,384
Then, when the time
is just right...

514
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,230
I'll play one off the other
and... wham!

515
00:40:01,231 --> 00:40:05,066
- They won't know what hit 'em.
- You're not gonna sleep with him, are you?

516
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,637
- That's not your problem.
- Okay, Laura?

517
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:10,468
I got my hand on your butt.

518
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,565
Okay. Hold on.

519
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,837
I got someone on call waiting.

520
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:18,039
Hello? Hello?

521
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,981
It was nobody. Okay, now.

522
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:26,181
I got my hand on your butt,
and I'm squeezing.

523
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,088
Tyler!
Get your hand off my butt.

524
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:31,991
- Mr. Drysdale!
- Get a pencil and write this down.

525
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,030
Yes, Mr. Drysdale.

526
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:37,259
Right. Uh-huh.
I can do that.

527
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:04,954
Howdy, I'm Elly May.
You must be Mr. Drysdale's son.

528
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,397
Well, thanks for picking me up.
Is this here your car?

529
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:20,573
Are we goin' to school,
or are we just goin' to stand here all day?

530
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,913
- Hey, y'all. Howdy.
- She's with me.

531
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,147
<i>Heck, Morgan, I'm tryin' to be friendly-like...</i>

532
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,884
but these folks don't seem
to want to say howdy back.

533
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,187
- They sure are shy.
- So what?

534
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:39,489
Elly May, who cares?
They're losers.

535
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,690
Not one of them is worth
over 300 million.

536
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,892
<i>- Uh-oh.
- Well, if it isn't Morgan...</i>

537
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,435
spelled big "M,"
little "organ. "

538
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:50,530
- We've gotta go.   - Not so fast, bank boy.
Cough up your lunch money now.

539
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:53,735
All I have is $400
in traveler's checks.

540
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,836
So just sign them
and hand them over.

541
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:59,347
Jake, show these two what happened
to the last guy who didn't pay up.

542
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:07,080
Well, I can wire the money
to your account.

543
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,182
Before the close
of the business day.

544
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:14,525
I don't see why you
had to give anything to that gorilla.

545
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:17,226
Well, that gorilla
is the captain of the wrestling team.

546
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:20,394
Wow. I never wrestled a team before.

547
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:25,237
- Well, 'lessen you count the McCarter triplets.
- Cappuccino?

548
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:27,367
- What?
- Two.

549
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,914
Thank you, Tiffany.

550
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:39,251
<i>This here electronic whittler
works real fine.</i>

551
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,626
Why, hello, Jethro.

552
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,424
Well, howdy, Miss Hathaway.

553
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:52,101
My, don't you look strapping
in your new business suit.

554
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:57,796
- Armani?   - No. I'm pretty sure it's wool.
Sure does itch like wool.

555
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,810
- Miss Hathaway?
- Oh, no, no. We're colleagues.

556
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,245
Call me Jane.
Me Jane, you Jethro.

557
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:10,551
Okay. Okay, Miss Hathaway.

558
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:13,749
Can I get one of these
electronic whittlers for Uncle Jed?

559
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:17,925
<i>- It's his birthday coming up real soon.
- Let me make a note of that.</i>

560
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:21,122
And speaking of your Uncle Jed,
back to the job at hand...

561
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:23,961
- Finding him a suitable wife.
- Can I help?

562
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:27,265
Heck, back in the hollow, my ma
was the best matchmaker around.

563
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,771
- Is that so?
- Uh-huh.

564
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:34,367
First thing she'd do is get
the back-fence gossips start a-jawin'.

565
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:36,378
Why, we could drop some
items in the trades.

566
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,381
- Excellent.
- Thank you.

567
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:42,646
And then she'd...
What'd she do?

568
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:46,450
<i>She'd hang a sign
on the church bulletin board.</i>

569
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:49,890
Maybe we can get
a big bulletin board.

570
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:52,326
No, no. We'd better be
a bit more discreet.

571
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:55,330
<i>Tell me, what are your
uncle's favorite things?</i>

572
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:57,332
Shoot, that's easy.

573
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:00,801
<i>- He likes smoked crawdads.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

574
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,072
Sowbelly and hand-slung chitterlings.

575
00:44:03,373 --> 00:44:05,339
And sponge cake.

576
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:07,569
Besides food, Jethro.

577
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:12,206
- Oh. He likes people who don't waste nothin'.
- Oh, go on.

578
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:16,719
And his favorite song is "I'm So
Lonesome I Could Cry" by Hank Williams.

579
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,017
- Yes!
- Yes, ma'am.

580
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:19,247
<i>Entrez.</i>

581
00:45:26,488 --> 00:45:27,423
Excuse me, ma'am, uh...

582
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:29,424
is that Hank Williams I hear?

583
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:31,494
I'm sorry.
It must be too loud.

584
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:33,722
- I will...
- No, no.

585
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:36,925
I was just listening to it
while repairing this old dress...

586
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:40,094
and, uh, waiting for
my sponge cake to bake.

587
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,138
You're cookin' a sponge cake?

588
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,470
<i>Oui.
It is my spécialité.</i>

589
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,602
<i>I love this music.</i>

590
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,647
It makes me want to dance.

591
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:54,980
<i>It's so romantic.</i>

592
00:46:38,627 --> 00:46:41,163
<i>You are a fine dancer...</i>

593
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:44,163
and a very attractive man.

594
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:47,465
<i>Whomever Miss Hathaway
finds for you to marry...</i>

595
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,698
is going to be
a very happy woman.

596
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,241
Well, thank you, ma'am.

597
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:56,540
And all women know
"a-penis" is hard to find.

598
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:02,446
- Excuse me?
- "A-penis. "

599
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,885
Oh, happiness!

600
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,652
Well, uh...

601
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,990
I've disturbed
your work enough, ma'am.

602
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,939
Jethro, have you considered
getting a new car?

603
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:31,381
Nope, but I told Uncle Jed we should slap
a new coat of paint on this'n.

604
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:33,945
But he said just
'cause we had money...

605
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:35,978
we didn't need to go
showin' it off.

606
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:38,054
I was just thinking,
oh, you should, you should.

607
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:41,215
You would look so good
in a big new fashy car.

608
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:44,761
<i>Big fashy car, huh? Maybe.</i>

609
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:47,529
Yep.

610
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:53,531
Okay, Miss Jane,
I'm 'bout ready to pull over.

611
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:56,333
You are so impossibly romantic.

612
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,704
Close your eyes.

613
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,709
Hot diggity dog!

614
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,678
Okay, now,
keep 'em closed.

615
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,442
How charmingly old-fashioned.

616
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,916
Mm.

617
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,146
Open your eyes
and look up.

618
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:14,624
<i>Ain't she pretty?</i>

619
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,218
Oh, my God!

620
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:20,796
The chief is going to kill me.

621
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:34,376
<i>We'll be back
with the financial news after this message.</i>

622
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,912
<i>Howdy.
I'm jethro Bodine.</i>

623
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,175
I'm talkin' to all
you ladies out there.

624
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:41,410
<i>Are you looking for
the perfect husband?</i>

625
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:43,418
<i>Then considerjed Clampett.</i>

626
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,148
Yes, Jed is rated triple A's...

627
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:50,420
for a-ttractive, a-vailable,
and a-billionaire.

628
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:53,587
So come on down
to the Commerce Bank of Beverly Hills...

629
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:55,756
<i>and see me, jethro Bodine,
vice president.</i>

630
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:57,766
<i>- Dear, what's the matter?
- And remember.</i>

631
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:01,668
I'm not only Jed's wife finder.
I'm also his nephew.

632
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,608
I'm ruined.

633
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:39,041
Oh!

634
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:54,951
Howdy.

635
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:58,253
Thank you.

636
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:02,059
Hathaway, you are embarrassing
this institution!

637
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,099
<i>This is a carnival.</i>

638
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:07,432
What kind of a numbskull would
think up a harebrained scheme like this?

639
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:09,596
That'd be me, Mr. Drysdale.

640
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:11,401
Y- Your idea.
Well...

641
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,341
<i>Well, it's brilliant.!</i>

642
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:16,844
Insightful. Cutting edge.

643
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:19,040
<i>You're a born leader, son.</i>

644
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:22,641
We've have had 1,215 women
respond to the ad.

645
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:24,721
- And two men.
- Wh...

646
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:28,882
Once I've entered the data into the computer,
worked my magic... presto.

647
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:33,622
- We will narrow them down to a precious few.
- Send in the next five.

648
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:37,359
Oh, uh, Hathaway, uh,
you're not validating parking, are you?

649
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:39,367
Parking? Um...

650
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:41,767
Oh, that was my idea too,
Mr. Drysdale.

651
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:45,968
Well, it's a brilliant idea,
if I may say so.

652
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:52,205
<i>Let's see, uh...</i>
<i>1,215 women... and two men.</i>

653
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:54,442
<i>At a dollar and a half
every 15 minutes.</i>

654
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:57,418
Ah, well, that's only
gonna cost me 5...

655
00:50:57,521 --> 00:51:00,046
5-5-5-5... $5,000.

656
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:03,217
Well...

657
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,891
<i>- Bonjour, Jethro.
- Well, howdy, Miss Laurette.</i>

658
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:13,902
What is all of this?

659
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:17,405
Miss Jane said a big fancy car
would be more suitin' to my personality...

660
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:20,533
so I'm fixin' on makin' one
out of my truck.

661
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:24,239
Personally, if it would have been me,
I would have just bought a new one.

662
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,747
But... carry on.

663
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,845
What a moron.

664
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:36,291
Hey, organ,
what are you doin' here?

665
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:38,258
- You come here to wrestle me?
- No.

666
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:40,261
Or did you just come here
to kiss the gym foor?

667
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:42,991
Come on, Morgan, just kiss it.
Come on, kiss it.

668
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,491
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

669
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:47,534
And what business
is it of yours, baby?

670
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:51,198
<i>What are you doing here, anyway,
corn pone?</i>

671
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:54,170
I came by to join
the wrestlin' team.

672
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:55,977
I don't wrestle girls,
at least not in the gym...

673
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,979
but in your case,
I'll make an exception.

674
00:51:58,081 --> 00:52:01,072
- Good. Then let's get started.
- Whoa!

675
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,644
<i>- I'm gonna kill you!
- I'm goin' to kill you.!</i>

676
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:06,688
No one is going to kill
anyone here!

677
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,758
Not without a signed
permission slip from home.

678
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:11,453
<i>- Got it?
- Got it, Coach.</i>

679
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,830
So, Jethro...

680
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:19,163
<i>building on your visionary plan
for finding your uncle's wife...</i>

681
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:23,171
I've... I've created
this rather modest database program.

682
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:26,333
<i>I've cross-referenced the applicants...</i>

683
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:30,345
<i>against the parameters
you indicated he desired...</i>

684
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:34,315
by specifying the search criteria
into functional groupings...

685
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:37,909
<i>and selecting the field values...</i>

686
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:40,182
through the use
of embedded commands...

687
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:44,522
and, of course,
basic Boolean algebra.

688
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:51,897
Miss Jane, I have no idea
what you just said.

689
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:59,399
Oh, Jethro, you are
so delightfully... primitive.

690
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:05,774
Uh, Miss Hathaway, would you
step into my office, please.

691
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:08,942
<i>- And bring the, uh, the Arlington file.
- Yes, sir.</i>

692
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:11,077
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Mr. Drysdale...</i>

693
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:14,180
since I have trained three Kentucky Derby
winners for other people...

694
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:18,250
<i>it seems a logical extension that I'd want
to own and operate my own stud farm...</i>

695
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,056
Arlington Acres.

696
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:23,155
Well, it's just...
It's just a very exciting idea.

697
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:26,535
Then you agree that his net worth
and rural background...

698
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,827
make Jed Clampett
the perfect partner for such a venture.

699
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:32,375
Absolutely. You and Clampett,
partners in a stud farm.

700
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:35,410
<i>- I think it's a wonderful idea.
- So you'll call him and arrange for us to meet?</i>

701
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:37,742
You bet I will.

702
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:40,714
- I'm sure he can't wait to see you.
- Oh.

703
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:44,412
In fact, as soon as you leave, I'm going
to call Mr. Clampett on the phone.

704
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:46,887
- Ah! This is very exciting.
- Isn't it?

705
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,788
Yeah.

706
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,587
<i>But, chief,
you specifically told me...</i>

707
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:55,927
that you did not want Mr. Clampett
involved in such a risky venture.

708
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:57,966
Exactly.
Shred and burn that.

709
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:00,459
<i>And don't ever let that lady
back in this office.</i>

710
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,161
It went fantastically.

711
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:07,141
Mr. Drysdale said I would
be a perfect partner for Mr. Clampett.

712
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:09,907
Yes. I'll tell you more
when I get back. Bye.

713
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:16,978
Excuse me, ma'am. If Mr. Drysdale thinks
you'd be perfect for my Uncle Jed...

714
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,488
I can take you over
to meet him right now.

715
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,991
- Wonderful!
- Come on.

716
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,688
I think you're gonna
like Miss Arlington.

717
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:29,526
Miss Jane picked her out
with her computer-datin' base.

718
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:32,602
Then Mr. Drysdale
personally approved her.

719
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:35,330
Computer-datin' base, huh?

720
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,305
What'll they think of next?

721
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:42,174
<i>- Hello, Miss Arlington.
- Mr. Clampett.</i>

722
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:45,908
Well, gee, uh, I don't know
quite how to begin.

723
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:49,008
Then let me start.

724
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:53,351
I know, by just looking at you,
you are the perfect man for my stud farm.

725
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:58,294
- Stud farm?
- If it makes it any easier for you...

726
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:01,527
I am willing to take on
multiple partners.

727
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,197
Multiple partners.

728
00:55:09,639 --> 0:55:15,435
Uh, no offense, ma'am... but I'm afraid
I'd find that just a tad uncomfortable.

729
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:18,937
Well, what if it was with somebody
you really trusted...

730
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,848
like Mr. Drysdale?

731
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,219
I don't think this is
the sort of thing...

732
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,881
Mr. Drysdale would want
to be involved in.

733
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,285
Oh, well, you should
have seen his face...

734
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:32,159
when I showed him the pictures
of what I have in mind.

735
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:35,331
- He was very excited.
- I don't doubt that.

736
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:38,028
Would you like to see the pictures?
They're very detailed.

737
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:40,500
Not just yet!

738
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:42,571
Don't you think we're
movin' awful fast?

739
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:47,974
Oh, not as far
as I'm concerned, Mr. Clampett.

740
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:51,070
I've got my license,
and I'm ready to breed.

741
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:55,517
Excuse me, ma'am, uh...

742
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:57,745
I could use a glass
of iced tea.

743
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,952
- Yourself?
- Sure.

744
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:04,515
I'm learnin' Elly May to ride my motorcycle!

745
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:07,994
<i>- How do you stop this thing?
- I'm gonna tan your hide.!</i>

746
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:11,932
You're doin' real good.
Now put on the brakes!

747
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,935
<i>- Granny?
- Whoa.!</i>

748
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,937
I'm gonna get you!

749
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:21,135
Granny! Watch your head!

750
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:28,479
Stop! Oh-oh-oh!

751
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:36,153
<i>- Dang!
- I'll help you, Granny.</i>

752
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:38,557
<i>Come on. Swim over here.</i>

753
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:40,754
There we go. Give me your hand.

754
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:43,628
Upsy-daisy.
Come on.

755
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,065
<i>There we...
Ow.! Granny.!</i>

756
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:48,797
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Granny!

757
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:51,437
<i>Miss Arlington, you reckon if we got hitched,</i>

758
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:54,139
you could help me tame
my daughter, Elly May?

759
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,940
Are you proposing
we get married?

760
00:56:57,046 --> 00:57:00,914
Well, I wouldn't feel
right about breedin' if we didn't.

761
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:14,829
Okay, men, that's it. Hit the mineral baths.

762
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,263
<i>- Howdy.
- Well, well. Look who's here.</i>

763
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:21,030
<i>- Missed you at practice, babe.
- She didn't come alone.</i>

764
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:23,002
Hey, Morgan.
What are you doin' here?

765
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:28,976
<i>- Well, who's all these folks?
- Just to keep things fair.</i>

766
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:31,842
- Is this some kind of joke?
- Well, come on, baby.

767
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,677
Let's wrestle.

768
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:38,812
- Come on!
- Come on. Give it to him.

769
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:41,891
<i>Oh, wait. That's mine.</i>

770
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:44,152
It's mine.

771
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:48,323
Come on, man.
You can do it!

772
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:51,127
- Fight in the gym.
- All right. - Cool.

773
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:10,918
<i>Wait. Hold on. I'm getting a fax.</i>

774
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:17,255
Meet me there.

775
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:29,771
This here's what I call
the Clampett clamp.

776
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:31,602
That's not legal.

777
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:34,074
Really?
Well, try this one.

778
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:39,343
Hey, come on.

779
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:42,179
- I call it the possum pretzel.
- That ain't legal either.

780
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:45,516
- Well...
- Ow!

781
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:49,983
What about
the hickory nut crunch?

782
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,093
That's definitely not legal!

783
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:59,828
Well, ain't nothin' legal 'round here?

784
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:11,543
One, two...

785
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,947
One, two...

786
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:20,386
- Yeah!
- Three.

787
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:33,568
Young lady!

788
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:37,435
I think we've found
a new team captain.

789
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:40,509
Sorry, Derek.
You're demoted.

790
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:43,638
Come here, Morgan.

791
00:59:44,746 --> 00:59:46,340
Thanks, y'all.

792
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:58,054
I truly appreciate y'all a-tossin' me
this here fancy birthday party.

793
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:01,460
Everybody looks just as nice as peach pie.

794
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:05,066
I just got one
question for you...

795
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:08,093
- Who are these people?
- Well...

796
01:00:15,944 --> 01:00:17,508
Howdy, Miss Jane.

797
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,082
<i>Oh, my goodness, jethro.</i>

798
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:26,078
I took your advice...
made me a big fashy car.

799
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:29,386
It's very you.
Very, very macho.

800
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:33,121
- Thank you.
- Well, shall we?

801
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:40,465
Is Pa here yet?

802
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:46,336
Elly May Clampett,
you look plumb elegant.

803
01:00:46,342 --> 01:00:50,278
Thanks, Pa. I feel kind of funny
gettin' all gussied up like this...

804
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:54,215
but Miss Laurette
says I'll get used to it.

805
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:58,151
You've done a fine job in
turnin' Elly May into a lady.

806
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:00,950
Thank you,
Monsieur Clampett.

807
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:04,823
She is a diamond in ze rough,
just like you.

808
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:09,057
What's all this?

809
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:12,430
Sushi, calamari, caviar.

810
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:15,527
What? Speak American.

811
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:18,266
Listen, I was wondering if, um...

812
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:20,342
maybe sometime
we could go out.

813
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:24,743
Not on a date or anything, but just maybe
to go get some burgers or something.

814
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,645
Take off that silly hat.

815
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:32,444
Then again, I would, uh...
understand if you didn't want to.

816
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:36,389
Sounds like fun.

817
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:39,723
So, Jethro, once we find
your Uncle Jed a wife...

818
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:43,629
- Perhaps it'll be your turn to get hitched.
- Me? No.

819
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:46,702
I'm gonna be
a Hollywood bachelor...

820
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:48,930
date all the hot young starlets.

821
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:52,838
Well, let me remind you not to overlook
the charms of the slightly older woman...

822
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:57,379
who more than makes up with experience
what she may lack in other arenas.

823
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,812
Okay, Miss Jane.

824
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:02,146
No problem.

825
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:06,711
<i>- Oh, please, let me.
- Tyler, clam it. It's showtime.</i>

826
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:15,931
Miss Laurette?
Why are you cryin'?

827
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:20,701
I- I have just spoken
with your father.

828
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:24,102
And he says I would make
"ze" [the] best wife for him.

829
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:28,473
- He did?
- But as happy as I would make him...

830
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:34,016
<i>I am afraid that you will think I'm too young
and beautiful to be your mother.</i>

831
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:41,289
Who'd of thought it...
Miss Laurette and my pa? Hmm.

832
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:46,183
Oh, where is he? Oh.

833
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:50,933
So I can call you whenever I want?
You'll hotfoot it right over?

834
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:54,730
- Mm-hmm.
- Hot dog.

835
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:57,305
Thank you.

836
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:04,677
I will miss Elly May so much
when you find yourself a wife.

837
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:10,413
- And I will miss you too.
- I hadn't thought about you not bein' here.

838
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,387
It's sure been a pleasure
to have you stay with us.

839
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:15,184
Thank you.

840
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,156
Jed?

841
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:20,388
Elly May said ze strangest thing
to me tonight.

842
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:23,226
She said she would love
for me to be her mother.

843
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:28,031
<i>I'm sure she'll get over the disappointment
in whomever you choose.</i>

844
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:32,908
I love Elly May
just like a daughter.

845
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:35,204
Perhaps you should
speak with her.

846
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,541
I'll do that.

847
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:48,215
Well.

848
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,224
This here's a big night for you...

849
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:54,460
all dressed up and ladylike
at your first Beverly Hills social.

850
01:03:54,464 --> 01:03:57,024
Your ma would be so proud.

851
01:03:57,033 --> 01:04:00,933
Thanks, Pa. Miss Laurette said
she was right proud too.

852
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:03,767
You like her, don't you?

853
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:07,502
Well, I like her just fine,
and I guess you like her too.

854
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:09,578
I certainly do.

855
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:13,782
All I want is for you
to be happy, Elly May.

856
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:17,744
I just want you
to be happy, Pa.

857
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,482
Well, I reckon
there's no time like right now.

858
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:28,021
<i>- Happy birthday, jed.
- Happy birthday.</i>

859
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:37,772
Oh!

860
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:02,125
Well, I got a feeling you're
worth every dime of it too.

861
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:05,394
Step up here. Let me take
a good look at you.

862
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:08,629
Boy, you're looking good
on your birthday.

863
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:11,536
I think we need a speech,
don't you? Speech.

864
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:19,407
You know, I have more
than any one man deserves...

865
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:22,484
yet there is something
I'd like for my birthday.

866
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:27,989
I'd like to ask the one who helped Elly May
become a lady to be my wife.

867
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:33,521
Miss Laurette Voleur.

868
01:05:33,629 --> 01:05:36,598
Oh, I am so surprised.

869
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,425
<i>This is ze happiest day
of my life.</i>

870
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:45,706
Huh?

871
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:49,335
All right.
Congratulations.

872
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:47,665
- You don't say.
- I do say!

873
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:49,863
Well, I'll be.
Who's he marrying?

874
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:53,840
Oh, some foozy
with a fancy accent.

875
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:56,173
She seems sneaky to me.
I don't trust her.

876
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:58,405
Oh, Granny, you
don't trust anybody.

877
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,880
Never mind about that.

878
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:04,714
I'm invitin' you to the weddin'
and the cousins.

879
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:09,450
But just from Jed's side,
not includin' the Kelloggs nor the Daggs.

880
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:12,618
Now, Granny, you're not gonna
get into your tonic...

881
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:15,219
and disappear like you did when Jed
married your daughter, are ya?

882
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:23,299
Jethrine, your Uncle Jed's
gettin' married.

883
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:28,603
I always cry at weddings.

884
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:31,202
Oh, now, honey.

885
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:34,111
I do.

886
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:41,046
Well, you got both kinds
of chickens here, Jed.

887
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:44,126
- White and the brown.
- What you got there, son?

888
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:47,889
Oh, it's just a standard
prenuptial agreement.

889
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:53,128
Miss Hathaway said for you not to tell
anyone that you signed it, not even her.

890
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:58,434
Well, if Miss Hathaway says so,
I don't even have to read this. It must be fine.

891
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:06,341
They'll be comin' from miles around
to get my expert doctorin'...

892
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:09,247
and I won't
turn a one away.

893
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:13,381
I done took me the "hypocritter" oath
to help everybody.

894
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,795
Kinda weak.

895
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:25,024
Probably good enough for city folk.

896
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:27,602
<i>Tyler.!</i>

897
01:08:29,905 --> 01:08:32,533
Did you get him
to sign the papers?

898
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:35,735
Oh, yeah.
He's a very trusting man.

899
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:37,972
He thinks everyone's honest.

900
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:41,538
That's a quality I admire in a man
I'm taking advantage of.

901
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:44,778
Hey, uh, you're not
sleeping with him, are you?

902
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:48,755
Tyler, you know once I move in with a man,
I stop having sex with him.

903
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:50,826
Oh, yeah.
That's right.

904
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:56,489
<i>- Keep your mind on business. Now go.
- Hey, wait.</i>

905
01:08:56,599 --> 01:09:00,729
<i>- How about a little good-bye kiss?
- All right.</i>

906
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:04,666
I knowed it!
I knowed it!

907
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:07,708
I done catched you red-handed,
you two-timin' hussy!

908
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:11,302
<i>When I inform jed, the weddin'will be off!</i>

909
01:09:11,413 --> 01:09:13,677
Let's get her.

910
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:16,580
Uh-oh. Oh.

911
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:21,915
No! No! No!

912
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:28,594
<i>Shut up, you old hag.!</i>

913
01:09:28,697 --> 01:09:32,155
We got just the place for you.

914
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:34,168
Let me down!

915
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:42,276
I've already input the info
into the computer.

916
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:45,779
Soon as you say "I do"... bing!
I press "Enter. "

917
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:48,441
Boom! The money goes
via modem to Switzerland.

918
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:51,884
Bing, bang, boom.
We're rich!

919
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:56,154
- Oh.
- Look at those legs.

920
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:59,227
I can't wait to get them
wrapped around me.

921
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:01,853
Get her off of me!

922
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:04,592
- Get those legs off him!
- She's got crap on her boots!

923
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:11,431
She doesn't even think we're her grandchildren.

924
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,202
And you say you fear
for your lives?

925
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:18,440
Yes. I'm afraid the poor old dear
tried to shoot us with a shotgun.

926
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:20,572
Are there any other
indications of dementia?

927
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:23,413
Last week, we caught her
trying to eat a raccoon.

928
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:26,488
- Really?
- She calls us kidnappers.

929
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:28,989
They are! They are!
The old buzzards are!

930
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:31,389
<i>- Wait, now.
- Grandma, please.</i>

931
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:34,257
Ow! She bit me again, honey!

932
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:36,627
Better check her for rabies.

933
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,893
<i>- Get two orderlies in here stat!
- Poor old dear.</i>

934
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:45,665
<i>We can't take the heartbreak a minute longer.
We need to admit her someplace...</i>

935
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:49,574
where she can be kept in a straitjacket
away from sharp objects and pay phones.

936
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:52,977
<i>From what you've told me,
I'd say that your grandmother...</i>

937
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:58,714
is a perfect candidate
for, uh, electroshock therapy.

938
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:07,288
And nobody... I repeat nobody... is allowed
into the Clampett estate without an invitation.

939
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:10,331
<i>Sans invitation, non.</i>

940
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:13,265
<i>Miss jane, this fella's all mad at me
'cause I opened up...</i>

941
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:14,996
this box of wedding food...

942
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,595
but there ain't nothin' in there
but a bunch of snails.

943
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:21,608
<i>I think the snails got up in there
and et all the food.</i>

944
01:11:22,878 --> 01:11:25,346
No problem. Jethro,
we'll just buy some more.

945
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:28,109
And, Henri, the snails go back
to the garden where they belong...

946
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:31,015
<i>s'il vous plâit.</i>

947
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,985
To your posts.

948
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:37,218
<i>Everything's going fine,
but I have one small question.</i>

949
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:42,059
Granny has not been available for her
fitting, and the wedding is tomorrow.

950
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:46,328
<i>Hmm. Come to think of it, I ain't seen
hide nor hair of Granny since yesterday.</i>

951
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:49,063
And you're not concerned?

952
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:53,540
No. She done the same thing
when I married Elly May's ma.

953
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:56,543
Came pourin' in
about three days later...

954
01:11:56,645 --> 01:12:00,012
naked as a jaybird and
reeking of her medicine.

955
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:03,243
Hmm.

956
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:39,585
<i>Play it, George.!</i>

957
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:53,761
Whoo!

958
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:24,528
<i>Miss Hathaway, if the immediate family
isn't concerned enough...</i>

959
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:26,999
to file a missing persons report,
then there's nothing we can do.

960
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:29,297
But, Captain Gallo,
I suspect foul play.

961
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:32,340
I'm sorry,
but my hands are tied.

962
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:43,480
But if you're desperate,
you might try this guy.

963
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:48,784
He's expensive, but he's also the best
private investigator around.

964
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:02,269
Oh, this case was pretty easy
to crack, Miss Hathaway.

965
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:07,701
<i>I have met unsavory characters before,
but she takes the cake.</i>

966
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:11,841
Laurette Voleur,
a.k.a. Laura Jackson.

967
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:14,745
<i>A.k.a. Lili Lebecque.</i>

968
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:18,843
<i>Married 12 times to any guy
with a little extra money to throw around.</i>

969
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:21,081
I should've known.

970
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:26,059
<i>Voleur. French for "thief. "
Now what about Granny?</i>

971
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:31,064
The old lady is being forcibly held
at the Los Viejos Retirement Home...

972
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:35,868
<i>a disreputable establishment,
often cited for patient abuse.</i>

973
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:38,037
Be tough to break her out.

974
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:42,042
What a calamity,
and the wedding is just hours away.

975
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:50,411
Reverend, do you think Cousin Bill's gonna
be too busy to make it to the weddin'?

976
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:59,727
<i>Hillary, where did I put that invitation?</i>

977
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:05,163
<i>Flowers, come here. Quick.</i>

978
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:09,226
<i>They need tent stakes
in the backyard right now. Let's go.</i>

979
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:18,769
Hello. Clampett residence.
Mr. Drysdale?

980
01:15:18,781 --> 01:15:22,444
- I have an urgent call for Mr. Drysdale.
- I'll take that.

981
01:15:23,851 --> 01:15:26,452
He works for me.

982
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:29,524
- Woody Tyler. Can I help you?
- Tyler, what are you doing there?

983
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:32,287
Um, I just dropped by
to see if I could be of help.

984
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:35,124
Tell Mr. Drysdale
to stop the wedding.

985
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:39,963
- Okay.      - Laurette is a phony
who is after Mr. Clampett's money.

986
01:15:40,068 --> 01:15:42,400
Well, that's not good.

987
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:46,133
- Do it, Tyler, or your job is toast.
- I got it.

988
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:53,146
- She's getting fat, Mom.
- Where is Hathaway?

989
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:55,079
She was supposed
to check in with me hours ago.

990
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:58,152
- Well, I don't know, dear.
- Mr. Drysdale.

991
01:15:58,253 --> 01:16:00,949
- What do you want, Tyler?
- Miss Hathaway called.

992
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:03,547
She said something had come up and to go
ahead and start the wedding without her.

993
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:06,287
- Well, what could have come up?
- I wish I knew.

994
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:08,920
<i>My, what a lovely dog.</i>

995
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:11,226
Oh, thank you.

996
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,801
Tyler, make yourself useful.
Go count the olives.

997
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:15,802
Oh, yeah. Right away.

998
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:18,532
Oh, I hate that little worm.

999
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,303
What could possibly be more important
than this to Miss Hathaway?

1000
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:39,027
- Look at that. New nurse.
- Yeah.

1001
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:44,759
- Howdy, Mama!
- My baby! Oh! Why!

1002
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:47,767
My goodness, Beverly Hills
has made you so sophisticated.

1003
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:50,770
Doesn't your twin brother
look handsome?

1004
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:52,999
<i>- Hi, jethro.
- Give him a kiss, Jethrine.</i>

1005
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:56,703
Howdy, Jethro.

1006
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:09,113
Oh, excuse me.

1007
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:15,361
- I reckon.
- Yep.

1008
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:18,527
Young man...

1009
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:22,229
I am here to see
Daisy Mae Moses.

1010
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:24,828
Ah, then you must be here
for the rabies test.

1011
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:28,501
Yes. Rabies test.
Exactly right.

1012
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,703
Then you want Room 525.

1013
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:35,041
Oh, nurse.

1014
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:37,448
Better be careful.
She's a wild one.

1015
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:40,487
We had to give her
electroshock therapy.

1016
01:17:42,589 --> 01:17:43,888
Thank you.

1017
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:58,370
<i>- Excuse me.
- No problem.</i>

1018
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:05,243
My God.
Oh, Granny.

1019
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:11,714
<i>Your elixir.</i>

1020
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:17,190
I will take you
out of here immediately.

1021
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:19,192
Your hair is just
a bit disheveled.

1022
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:22,730
Miss Jane?
Is that you?

1023
01:18:22,831 --> 01:18:25,891
- 'Tis I.
- Oh!

1024
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:33,374
- Granny says she don't trust Miss Laurette.
- Oh.

1025
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:36,169
Take off that silly hat.

1026
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:50,951
I heard she's so skinny, you couldn't
hit her with a handful of corn.

1027
01:18:56,198 --> 01:19:00,999
<i>Look where they're parking the cars.
My God, how tacky.</i>

1028
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:04,838
This place is turning into a zoo.

1029
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:09,070
I think she's tryin' to
take him for all he's got.

1030
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:10,769
Hmm.

1031
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:22,387
Hi there, handsome.

1032
01:19:22,391 --> 01:19:25,719
- You mind if I sit in this chair?
- This chair?

1033
01:19:25,728 --> 01:19:28,856
- I was kind of saving...
- Thank you.

1034
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:33,497
Lovely wedding, isn't it?

1035
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:37,138
Go.

1036
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:45,002
Oh. We've got to get back.

1037
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:47,704
I called. I told them
to stop the wedding...

1038
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:49,081
but that Tyler
is so incompetent.

1039
01:19:49,085 --> 01:19:53,012
Tyler? Him and Laurette's the ones
that stuck me in this hellhole!

1040
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:56,479
So, stabbed in the back
by one of our own.

1041
01:19:56,492 --> 01:19:59,460
And she ain't no foreigner.

1042
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:01,859
There they are.
Stop them.

1043
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:29,990
Jethro, hold up.

1044
01:20:54,282 --> 01:20:56,580
- Come on. Come on.
- Oh, there she is.

1045
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:59,813
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Oh, she looks beautiful.

1046
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:04,059
Oh, I've got the vapors.

1047
01:21:25,413 --> 01:21:27,281
My makeup.

1048
01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:30,918

01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:47,760
But I believe you're readin'
the airplane safety instructions.

1054
01:21:47,869 --> 01:21:50,929
May we skip this part?

1055
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:54,634
Hathaway had better have
a good excuse for not being here.

1056
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,539
<i>Quick, Granny, hurry.!</i>

1057
01:22:00,682 --> 01:22:03,207
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Can I see your invitations, please?

1058
01:22:03,217 --> 01:22:06,614
I'll handle this, Granny. Young man, have you
any idea with whom you're speaking?

1059
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:10,179
I'd say one crazy lady
and another one with a bad wig.

1060
01:22:10,191 --> 01:22:12,785
Every strand of
this here hair is mine!

1061
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:14,885
- Ow!
- Oh... Oh, Granny, no, no, no!

1062
01:22:14,996 --> 01:22:17,590
No, Granny, no! No, Granny, no!
We'll find another way.

1063
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:21,658
"We are gathered here
to unite these two in holy matrimony. "

1064
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:27,838
- Can we hurry things up, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

1065
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:31,805
<i>Come on. Come on, baby.</i>

1066
01:22:31,814 --> 01:22:35,374
<i>"If any one of y'all has one good reason
these two shouldn't be hitched... "</i>

1067
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:37,849
<i>and it darn tootin'
better be a good reason...</i>

1068
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:41,286
"then speak now or forever
hold your peace. "

1069
01:22:43,425 --> 01:22:46,952
<i>- All right, then. "I now pronounce you... "
- Please. Please. Please.</i>

1070
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:48,989
<i>"man and... "</i>

1071
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:50,889
<i>What in tarnation is that?</i>

1072
01:22:54,669 --> 01:22:56,662
Charge!

1073
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:35,401
- Come on, Granny!
- Who is that?

1074
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:37,944
It is I, Jane Hathaway.

1075
01:23:38,046 --> 01:23:40,344
Hathaway,
have you lost your mind?

1076
01:23:40,448 --> 01:23:44,282
She's an impostor. She's marrying
Mr. Clampett just to steal his money.

1077
01:23:44,386 --> 01:23:48,584
- That sidewinder Tyler helped her!
- I'm ruined!

1078
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:50,453
Milburn! Milburn!

1079
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:55,997
Tyler. Let's set up the computer
and push the button.

1080
01:23:56,097 --> 01:23:58,292
If I can't have their money,
nobody should.

1081
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,062
Quick!

1082
01:24:01,169 --> 01:24:02,602
Okay.

1083
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:05,803
<i>We'll send their billion bucks
bouncin'around so many banks...</i>

1084
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:09,076
<i>- they'll never find it.
- It's all set.</i>

1085
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:11,077
All we got to do is push that button.

1086
01:24:12,081 --> 01:24:15,549
You rustic, nose-picking,
inbred yokels!

1087
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:19,984
- You're all about to be poor again.
- Think again.

1088
01:24:35,035 --> 01:24:37,027
<i>No, you don't,
you schemin'skunk.!</i>

1089
01:24:37,138 --> 01:24:39,163
Wait'll I get my hands on you!

1090
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:42,641
Oh, Pa, you must be
so disappointed.

1091
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:44,871
A little.

1092
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:47,504
But, Elly May, I was mainly
marryin' Miss Laurette...

1093
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:50,243
'cause I thought you wanted her
for your new ma.

1094
01:24:52,821 --> 01:24:55,654
- I'm so sorry, Pa.
- Don't be sorry.

1095
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:57,952
<i>I love you
just the way you are.</i>

1096
01:24:58,059 --> 01:25:00,755
<i>I reckon I oughta raise you up
to be who you want to be.</i>

1097
01:25:01,362 --> 01:25:05,196
Well, I don't need a new ma,
not as long as I got you and Granny.

1098
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:10,664
Hot dog, Miss Jane!
You sure are a good shot.

1099
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:12,899
Well, thank you, Jethro.

1100
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:13,996
- Whoo!
- Got ya!

1101
01:25:15,109 --> 01:25:17,337
Well, folks,
I guess you can say...

1102
01:25:17,345 --> 01:25:20,007
things didn't turn out
quite the way we planned.

1103
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:24,518
So, since there ain't
gonna be no hitchin'...

1104
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:26,951
and we're all here anyway...

1105
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:33,519
I say we have
one hellacious shindig.

1106
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:35,823
<i>Yeah.!</i>

1107
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:46,233
<i>- Let go of me.!
- Here, boys. She's all yours!</i>

1108
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:55,481
Let go of my hand!

1109
01:26:11,432 --> 01:26:14,367
- Hey! Nobody treats my pa that way!
- Shut up!

1110
01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:23,035
How's that for ladylike,
you old money-grubber?

1111
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:31,444
Come on, city boy,
let's dance.

1112
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:33,053
All right, stand back!

1113
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:41,955
You're under arrest
for kidnapping...

1114
01:26:41,963 --> 01:26:43,463
attempted embezzlement
and fraud.

1115
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:46,864
<i>Oh, right.!
It was all Tyler's idea.</i>

1116
01:26:53,508 --> 01:26:56,409
I admit it freely.
It was all her idea.

1117
01:26:56,511 --> 01:27:01,210
I always fall in love
with the wrong kind of man.

1118
01:27:01,316 --> 01:27:04,080
<i>- Clean up that cake.
- Don't step on the train.</i>

1119
01:27:04,185 --> 01:27:05,844
I'll wait for you, honey.

1120
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:15,154
<i>Well, where was she? She... Oh.!</i>

1121
01:27:15,263 --> 01:27:19,097
- Oh, well...
- Whee doggie!

1122
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:36,482
<i>Whoo.! Yeah.! That's good.</i>

1123
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:51,858
Thank you.

1124
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:55,834
That's just about right.
Oops!

1125
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:58,963
It's a shame they had to
file for bankruptcy.

1126
01:27:59,073 --> 01:28:01,701
I just hope my call to
the I.R.S. didn't have...

1127
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:04,505
- Oh, I shouldn't open it. Sorry.
- No problem. We'll do it again.

1128
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:06,170
<i>But I got there...</i>

1129
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:09,079
That old lady is, uh...

1130
01:28:09,183 --> 01:28:11,811
That old lady is...
I'm sorry.

1131
01:28:11,919 --> 01:28:14,353
- That's okay.
- She's gettin' pretty old by now, I'll tell ya.

1132
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:16,480
<i>Still rolling.</i>

1133
01:28:17,192 --> 01:28:22,150
<i>- Okay. Give me a big smile.
- I can't get any bigger.</i>

1134
01:28:26,434 --> 01:28:28,732
<i>So, uh, what happened?</i>

1135
01:28:28,836 --> 01:28:31,328
Actually, he slapped me.

1136
01:28:38,946 --> 01:28:42,074
Why don't you come up here?
Let me take a good look at you.

1137
01:28:43,918 --> 01:28:47,149
<i>Jim. Jim? They're gettin'worried about you.</i>

1138
01:28:51,759 --> 01:28:55,217
- Not even a bridesmaid.
- I gotta do this again.

1139
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,567
<i>Action.!</i>

1140
01:29:10,978 --> 01:29:13,105
We've got... No,
we've got to get back.

1141
01:29:13,214 --> 01:29:15,842
I called, I told them
to postpone the...

1142
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:17,850
- I lost my purse.
- It's right here.

1143
01:29:17,952 --> 01:29:21,251
- How did you get it?
- I don't know.

1144
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:24,723
Jethro?
Come on down here.

1145
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:27,090
Likely as not, there's
another family lives up here...

1146
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:28,958
there.
