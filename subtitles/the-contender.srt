00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:48,402
You know how I feel. Hanson
may have turncoated our way,
but a turncoat's a turncoat.

149
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,679
We've had a vacancy for three weeks. The
nation's moved from mourning to anxiety.

150
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:57,849
I need a vice president. And I need a
person who's gonna reflect my politics.

151
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:02,792
- Fill it with Frank Malloy.
- No, no. Malloy's got
an inflammation of ambition.

152
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:07,424
He won't be doing his job.
He'll be preparing to do mine.
He's not even my second choice.

153
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,991
If it doesn't work with Hanson,
we're gonna go back to Hathaway.

154
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:15,564
- Do you think Hanson's a team player?
- Senator Hanson is gonna work.

155
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:20,169
And it's the job of you two to make sure
that confirmation gets through.

156
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:24,410
- I need to know I can count on you.
- Of course you can.

157
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,914
The president and I discussed several
issues, including the vice presidency.

158
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:34,654
<i>-[Man] Did the president</i>
<i>offer you the position? </i>
- I asked him to withdraw my name.

159
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:38,219
<i>-[Phone Ringing]</i>
<i>-[Woman Moaning]</i>
<i>Don't answer it, please. </i>

160
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:42,063
<i>-[Ringing Continues]</i>
<i>-[Man] I gotta get it. </i>
<i>It's the red line. </i>

161
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:45,900
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>No, no, no, no. </i>

162
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:49,873
- Hanson here.
<i>-[Giggling]</i>

163
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,342
Yeah, of course I'll hold.

164
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,902
<i>Shh. Quiet. </i>

165
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,940
Hello, sir!
I'm great, sir, thank you. Yes.

166
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,819
<i>-As a matter of fact, </i>
<i>we're watching him on C-SPAN now. </i>
- No names were discussed.

00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:08,292
Yes, she is.
One second, sir.

168
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,760
It's the president.
He wants to talk to you.

169
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,732
You wanna speak to him?

170
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,702
Hello, sir.
This is Senator Hanson speaking.

171
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,307
Oh, Christ.

172
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:38,190
That's what the prick said to you?
"We can't have another Chappaquiddick."

173
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,191
No, not Evans. Newman said
the thing about Chappaquiddick.

174
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,693
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

175
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,196
That doesn't even make
any sense, Jack.

176
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,198
You weren't some drunk
who drove your car...

177
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,030
<i>off a bridge and abandoned the whore</i>
<i>you were fucking to die. </i>

178
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,400
That's what I told them.
Not in those words.

179
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:56,771
This is the second time
they fucked us over.

180
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,072
- Did he say who he was going with?
- No.

181
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:03,104
- It's gonna be Malloy.
Fucking Frank Malloy.
- That's what I'm hearing.

182
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:06,174
Jack, he isn't worthy of...

183
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:09,744
- This isn't happening to me.
- You can go.

184
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:13,485
You're gonna take it up the ass.
Want to bend over and make
their job a little easier?

185
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,857
You understand
what's going on here?

186
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,021
This is it.

187
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:21,999
The whole fucking plan, Jack,
everything, was to get to this point.

188
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,558
We have one shot at this,
and it's gone!

189
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:30,371
And you're gonna mope around
like some 12-year-old girl
who can't get a date to the dance?

190
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,535
"Frank Malloy,
that's what I'm hearing."

191
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:36,672
- What would you like me to do?
- I'd like you to give a shit.

192
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:41,550
I'd like you to call Shelly Runyon back
and get this fucking thing fixed!

193
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,080
- Why not?
- You've already gone over it.
It's done, ancient history.

194
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,456
I don't feel reconciled
about it yet.

195
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:53,226
[Indistinct Chattering]

196
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,930
- I'll think about it.
- No, I think it's fine.

197
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,439
Okay, I'm not convinced.

198
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,634
Thanks.

199
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:07,201
You sure you want
to have alcohol on your breath
the first time you meet the president?

200
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,907
- No, you're right.
<i>- No offense. Just wondering. </i>

201
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,542
I'm married
to the vice president, huh?

202
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:16,884
Whoa, whoa.
I haven't been confirmed yet.
I haven't even been asked yet.

203
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,322
You know what we gotta do pronto?
We gotta start working Runyon.

204
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,588
- Runyon's gonna be a problem.
<i>- Why is Runyon gonna be a problem? </i>

205
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,630
<i>- 'Cause he's head ofJudiciary. </i>
- But the Senate takes care...

206
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,565
<i>Everything but the vice president. </i>
<i>Twenty-fifth amendment</i>
<i>doesn't specify... </i>

00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,000
<i>who runs the show</i>
<i>on that confirmation. </i>

208
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,506
Rumor has it that the House
has advise and consent on this one.

209
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:38,839
<i>- Runyon lobbied just hard enough</i>
<i>to get his committee the gig. </i>
- Yeah, I think he did.

210
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,675
I know his number-two guy, Ted Baker.
We went to college together.
I'll phone him.

211
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:45,774
- I'll start pummeling him.
- No, no, no.
Don't say anything to him yet.

212
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:49,343
<i>- Why? </i>
- Let's get it on our own merit for now.

213
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:52,117
You know what?
I'm not gonna argue with you.

214
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,649
Not only are you right,
but you're about to meet the president,
and you look great.

215
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,027
<i>- Doesn't she look great? </i>
<i>- Yeah, she looks great. </i>

216
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,225
What do you think, Stevenson?

217
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,669
I'd go for the number six,
slightly right of center, sir.

218
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,706
That's what I was thinking.

219
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,937
That's what I was thinking.

220
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,979
<i>[Evans]</i>
<i>How's your average? </i>

221
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:18,483
- One forty-five last time out, sir.
- That's not bad.

222
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,720
No!

223

That's what I get
for my leftist tendencies.

224

- Senator Hanson

<i>- Bring 'em in. </i>

00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,034
Yes, sir.

<i>- Mr. President. </i>

- You remember my husband.
- Will Hanson. The McMahon campaign.

229
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:52,447
We tried to steal your husband away.
He runs a hell of a campaign.

230
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:57,182
You gave me nightmare visions
of having to return to my law practice.

231
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,623

- Lewis Hollis.

232

- What was the first name?
- Hollis.

233

- No, Lewis is my first name.
- Lewis. Welcome, Lewis.

234
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:10,133
So, have you guys
been down here before?

235

- [Together] No.
<i>-Johnson, he, uh... </i>

built it in '65.

00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:18,599
Right now some terrorist camp in Libya
is being spared a bombing raid...

238
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:23,011
because I'm obsessed
with beating my 150 average.

239
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:27,348
- You guys bowl?
<i>- Once in a while. </i>

240
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,353
What's your average?

241
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,286
- Seventy.
- I don't have one.

242
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,622
Hungry? You want some lunch
before we speak?

<i>No, thank you, sir. </i>

244
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,095
<i>[Evans] I saw this movie once</i>
<i>where the president... </i>

245
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,693
is just tickled that anything he wants
to eat he can get in a moment's notice.

246
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,432
Here. Turns out, it's the perk
of the century.

247

- Otto?
- Yes, Mr. President?

248
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:53,877
Sorry for the late notice. For lunch,
could you arrange coq au vin...

249
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:57,143
with a side of penne?

250
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,548
<i>-[Otto] Spicy or mild? </i>
- Spicy.

251
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:03,452
And, uh... Oh...

252
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:07,253
- Hazelnut pudding for dessert.
<i>- No problem, sir. </i>

253
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,886
One day I'll catch him napping.

254
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:14,331
- Anyway, how much
did we win that one by?
- 61 to 33, sir.

255
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,359
It's pretty easy
getting over things when you win.

256
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:22,396
I guess Sudan is where the press
will make its first hay.

257
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:26,808
I think if we announce,
the press might have
other things on its mind.

258
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:31,441
But you know,
Sheldon Runyon and Jack Hathaway
have been friends for years.

259
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:35,146
And Runyon is going to come after me
with all guns blazing.

260
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,556
Senator, why do we have to worry
about Shelly Runyon's guns
when I control the atomic bomb?

261
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:44,756
We'll introduce you
to the Cabinet in one hour.
I'll make the announcement then.

262
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,856
- That's fine, Mr. President.
- That's the wayJerry Ford
did it with Rockefeller.

263
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,993
I always thought it was pretty damn
classy. Have we notified the networks?

264
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,562
Oh, yes. All the pundits
are in a guessing feeding frenzy.

265
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,076
Box of Malomars says
they've already anointed Malloy.

266
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:02,170
- You look great, by the way. Just great.
- Thank you, sir.

267
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:06,809
Okay, guys, one hour,
the Cabinet Room.

268
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,285
<i>Off to the races! </i>

269
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:13,017

what you're gonna wear?
- She looks fine.

270
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,356
- No, she does.
- You look beautiful, Senator.

271
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,452
- Thank you.
- Very becoming.

272
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,463
I think it works.

273
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,595
Let me explain
how this is gonna work.

274
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,192
In a minute, POTUS is gonna come in,
make an announcement...

275
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,261
- Introduce you
to the vice presidential designate.
<i>-Jerry. </i>

276
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:30,570
We hear the president's decision
is Malloy. Can you confirm this?

277
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:34,510
In ten seconds you're gonna have
your answer. So calm down.

278
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:39,017
All right. Then after he's made...
Dave. [Whispers]

279
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:42,247
I'm gonna give you guys
20 minutes for questions and answers.

280
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:45,085
So keep them short
and, hopefully, sweet.

281
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,591
And you can roll starting now.

282
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,856
I'll introduce him
in five... thousand...

283
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:55,832
four... thousand,
three... thousand, two.

284
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,837
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.

285
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:07,144
Welcome. Good afternoon.
Please.

286
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:11,945
- Thank you for coming here
on such short notice.
<i>- Laine Hanson, from Ohio. </i>

287
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:15,919
As I embarked on the task
of selecting a vice president...

288
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,752
I was driven by the emotion
of wanting to make a choice...

289
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,453
that would've made Troy Ellard,
my friend, proud.

290
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:26,555
Senator Laine Billings Hanson
of Ohio is that person.

291
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,725
<i>[Toliver]</i>
<i>Sherri, you are first. </i>

292
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:34,102
<i>Ms. Hanson, do you feel being</i>
<i>a woman played any type of role</i>
<i>in the president's decision? </i>

293
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,768
Well, l, uh...
First I would like to say...

294
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,540
what an honor it is to be here
before you in this position.

295
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:46,073
And I hope to serve up to the
standards which President Evans
set for me in that introduction.

296
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:49,917
Thank you so much, sir.
To answer your question...

297
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:54,152
- First rate, Mrs. Hanson.
- Thank you. I learned
a lot from Will.

298
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,854
Ah, yes, Will.

299
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,920
You, sir, are gonna have
to make yourself scarce.

300
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:03,661
- No, of course.
I'll give you your privacy.
- No, I mean scarce.

301
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,999
During the confirmation period,
I want you out of sight.

302
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,733
- Pardon me?
<i>-A wife there behind her husband... </i>

303
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:11,173
is perceived as supportive.

304
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:16,340
A husband following around behind
his wife is perceived as a puppeteer.

305
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,975
- But I think...
- No, honey. I think
Mr. Newman's right on.

306
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,985
Let Hollis handle
the day-to-day...

307
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,749
- And I'll be the man behind the curtain.
- Where do we go from here?

308
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:27,952
<i>The FBI's gonna have to do</i>
<i>an extensive background check. </i>

309
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:31,427
- Director Friend
will handle the investigation.
- Yes, we made sure of that.

310
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,795
<i>Just about every aspect of your life</i>
<i>will be uncovered. </i>

311
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,960
Your bank accounts,
your medical reports.

312
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:41,301
- What am I forgetting?
<i>- Correspondence to</i>
<i>government agencies, speeches... </i>

313
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:45,810
When Nelson Rockefeller was confirmed,
they had over 300 agents working on him.

314
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:49,142
They had a lot more life
and cash to investigate, huh?

315
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:53,310
<i>We'll do our own background</i>
<i>check in case anything falls</i>
<i>through the cracks, to be safe. </i>

316
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:57,344
- At the same time,
the House will... Come in.
<i>-[Knocking At Door]</i>

317
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,982
The House will put together
its bipartisan subcommittee...

318
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:04,290
of theJudiciary to interview you and
advise and consent to your nomination.

319
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,695
Shelly Runyon's
running the show there.

320
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,724
Cheyenne, Wyoming, you're on with
Vice President Designate Laine Hanson.

321
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,168
- [Man] Larry, how are you?
- I'm fine. Thanks for calling.

322
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:16,469
I just wanted to say
to the senator that...

323
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,668
all of Cheyenne is with her.

324
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:22,680
We think she's absolutely great for
the country and this administration.

325
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,774
- Congratulations.
- [King] What's the question, sir?

326
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:29,810
<i>I wanted to ask the senator, if she</i>
<i>could pick one person from history... </i>

327
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:33,517
<i>to serve as her model for how to behave</i>
<i>in office, who would that be? </i>

328
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,322
<i>-[Knock At Door]</i>
<i>-[King] Good question, Senator. </i>

329
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:40,331
<i>Hey, guys. </i>
<i>Nice to see you. </i>

330
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:45,496
<i>-Sorry to barge in on you. </i>
- No, no, no, no.
I'm just watching your girl.

331
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,062
- First female prime ministers?
- They were great leaders.

332
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,268
Would you put Thatcher
in that category?

333
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,675
No, I don't think so.

334
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:57,681
- You know what? I would
have to say Thomas Jefferson.
- [King] A man?

335
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,650
<i>-She's something, isn't she? </i>
- I don't really know her.

336
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:05,088
We served together
a few years ago, and, I guess...

337
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,217
we just ended up
in different company.

338
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:12,195
- Take a seat.
<i>- Congressman, the president</i>
<i>asked us to come down here. </i>

339
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,791
<i>He'd like to let you know</i>
<i>he'd appreciate your support</i>
<i>in the senator's confirmation. </i>

340
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:21,134
- Really?
<i>- He asked me directly, Shell. </i>

341
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:24,039
But the president didn't consider it
important enough to ask me personally?

342
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,875
<i>You know it's important. </i>
<i>It's the old man's swan song. </i>

343
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:30,540
<i>Putting a woman in office</i>
<i>means something to him. </i>

344
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:33,379
Laine Hanson's
the absolute best choice.

345
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:38,412
You don't believe that.
Come on. You're too smart.

346
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,118
Look, I don't mind
she's a woman...

347
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:45,562
but I'm not confirming a woman
just because she's a woman.

348
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,622
Laine Hanson
has an extra burden.

349
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,897
She's has to come on the world stage
with perfect credentials.

350
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,165
Margaret Thatcher didn't have perfect
credentials. The world respected her.

351
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:58,676
The world accepted Margaret Thatcher
because they knew she had to answer
to Ronald Reagan.

352
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:03,272
A woman better be pretty damn qualified
to have nobody to answer to...

353
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:07,842
and Laine Hanson
is not that.

354
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,683
Look me in the eyes
and tell me...

355
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:15,420
that Laine Hanson is your first choice
for the vice presidency.

356
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,923
Laine Hanson
is my absolute first choice.

357
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,093
I'd so want you
in my poker game.

358
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,602
Country needs
a smooth confirmation.

359
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,612
The president needs
a smooth confirmation.

360
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,343
- The country needs
a competent vice president.
<i>-[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

361
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,784
Excuse me a minute.

362
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:45,846
There's only one person in the world
that has that phone number.

363
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:50,054
So who's the second choice?

364
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,790
We haven't really settled
on anybody yet.

365
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:56,891
Tell me, if Laine Hanson were
to be hit by a flying car...

366
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,562
who would the president
then select?

367
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,330
[Sighs]

368
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:06,707
I think the president
still likes Jack Hathaway, Congressman.

369
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,845
<i>You know... </i>

370
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,516
Jack Hathaway, there's a good man...
for a Democrat.

371
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:23,288
[Laughs] There's a man
I would say would have...

372
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:26,057
a smooth confirmation.

373
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,725
- Jack Hathaway?
- Smooth as a baby's ass.

374
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,463
- He's already taken himself
out of it, so...
<i>- Right. </i>

375
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,028
Right!
Well, who the hell knows?

376
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:38,371
Perhaps Lainey
will shock the world...

377
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,673
by pulling out
her brilliance...

378
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:43,441
<i>and erudition at the hearings</i>
<i>that none of us know she has. </i>

379
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:46,177
So, Shelly, can we ask
for basic fairness?

380
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:50,779
<i>- Fifty-fifty, Democrat and</i>
<i>Republican at the hearings? </i>
- Of course you can.

381
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:05,293
Congressman! Congressman!
Mr. Runyon.

382
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,498
Just wanted to steal you
for a second. I'm Reg Webster.

383
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:12,942
- Oh, you're one of Stoney's boys?
- Uh, no.

384
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,138
You staff or intern?

385
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:18,649
Actually I'm a representative.
Reginald Webster of Delaware.

386
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:22,175
Oh, fuck me. I'm sorry, Webster.
What can I do for you?

387
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:26,520
- I'm running late.
- I was hoping I could grab
your attention for a second.

388
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:29,822
- What's the skinny?
- Well, uh...

389
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:34,764
- I'm late, Mr. Webster.
- I understand a chair's
opened up in the committee...

390
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,858
and I'd like
to put my name forward.

391
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,665
I believe you'll find me
industrious and hardworking.

392
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:43,105
TheJudiciary's
for senior members.

393
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:46,632
Wheeling was in for five terms
before we let him in.

394
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,179
My hands are tied.
There's nothing I can do.

395
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,807
Shelly, I've been trying
to reach you for five days.

396
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:55,046
- I left you 3 2 messages.
- Well, leave me a 33rd.

397
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,953
- Where you from?
- Delaware.

398
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:02,323
Oh, yeah, you were...
You knocked Emory Bettis out.

399
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,022
Emory used to be
in the Thursday night game.

400
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,656
He was always good
for a few hundred bucks.

401
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,257
I guess he ran his campaign
like he played poker.

402
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:14,499
I take it you have
a predisposition.

403
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:18,839
- About the confirmation, I mean.
- No. Actually, I'm 100% objective.

404
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,107
- Mmm. Do you have
a dictionary, Mr. Webster?
- Yeah.

405
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,775
Take a Magic Marker,
cross out the word "objectivity."

406
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,753
Your constituents want you
for your opinions, your philosophy...

407
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:33,484
for your subjectivity.

408
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,797
Laver has to duck
out of the way of that one.

409
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:45,734
<i>One that Laver can't get. </i>
<i>He's still trying to recover. </i>

410
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:51,540
And he zings another
powerful forehand past Laver.

411
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,976
See that, Tim-Tim?
Know what we call that?

412
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:57,378
- We call that topspin.
You know how we get topspin?
- Uh-huh.

413
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,646
<i>- Yeah? Tell me. </i>
- 'Cause BabyJesus made topspin.

414
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,653
<i>What? </i>

415
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,155
<i>- BabyJesus gave it topspin. </i>
- Jesus?

416
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:07,851
Ah! Why do you say that?

417
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:12,556
- Because BabyJesus made everything.
- Yeah? Who told you that?

418
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,099
<i>Miss Moyer in kindergarten, </i>
<i>and Mommy says... </i>

419
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:18,693
<i>- I have to listen Miss Moyer. </i>
- Wow, this is news to me.

420
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:23,173
I gave up my career
trying to strike that nonsense
out of the public school system.

421
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,539
Maybe I ought to put him
in public school, then.

422
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,544
Remember what I told you
about moving your grip down...

423
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:30,172
- And to the left?
- Uh-huh.

424
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:33,513
- Go see if Dad's found
his bathing suit yet.
- Gimme a hug.

425
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:38,051
Yeah. Thanks, champ.

426
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:47,159
- They are paid to teach, not...
- To preach.

427
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:50,531
I know, but he's six years old, and he
also believes in the tooth fairy...

428
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:55,198
- And that George Washington
never told a lie.
- Well, it drives me crazy.

429
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:58,333
- Mary, wanna turn the ball machine off?
<i>- Yes, Mr. Governor. </i>

430
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,114
Thanks for seeing me, Dad.

431
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,616
- Why wouldn't I see you?
- Partisanship.

432
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:10,280
I gotta love
at least one Democrat.

433
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:18,988
You know, Dad, I'm getting some reports
that you might not be ready to back me.

434
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,555
That you're opposed
to my confirmation...

435
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,430
- You've heard quotes?
- No, I haven't heard.

436
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:26,231
Just that we should expect
to be reading of your opposition.

437
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:29,102
Pardon my Swahili, but you're being led
a line of pure bullshit.

438
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:34,578
- I haven't said a word.
<i>- Maybe it's just that. </i>
<i>Maybe you've been quiet. </i>

439
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:37,342
- I hate the press.
<i>- I know, Dad. </i>

440
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:40,942
- When I left the mansion,
I swore I would never talk to them.
<i>- I remember. </i>

441
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:46,184
- I suppose you're gonna force
my hand on this, huh?
- You wouldn't have to say much.

442
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,248
- Just a little something.
- Okay, okay.

443
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:51,693
l, uh...

444
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,924
I'll call back
Joe Glynn at the <i>Times. </i>

445
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,523
He's okay.
He'll write it up well.

446
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:59,297
I once leaked him
some shit about Buchanan.
Damn near won him the Pulitzer.

447
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,702
- Thanks, Dad.
- Sure.

448
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,707
Thanks.

449
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:07,404
What would you do,
or have done, in my case?

450
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:11,779
Well, when your president
asks you to jump...

451
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,341
it's hard not to jump,
that's for sure.

452
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,115
But you remember what Ben Franklin
said about the vice presidency.

453
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,952
What did he say?
I didn't talk to him this week.

454
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:24,984
He said he ought to be addressed as
"Your Superfluous Excellency."

455
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:28,396
In the past ten years,
I've enjoyed the kind of power
the vice presidency can't offer.

456
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:31,026
Why would anybody want
to give that up? Am I crazy?

457
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,594
Baby, power is
where power goes.

458
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:37,971
- Think you can beat me?
- Uh, yeah. Okay.

459
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:40,909
Hey, Tony!

460
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,447
Foul!

461
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:47,315
Can't trust
those fuckin' people.

462
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:52,254
Speaking of which, Mr. Webster,
it turns out you're a Democrat.

463
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:55,724
l, uh, wasn't keeping it
a secret.

464
00:29:55,794 --> 00:30:00,231
Sad to say, I don't think I can
bring you aboard the committee, son.

465
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,064
<i>Ray Spies makes all the decisions</i>
<i>regarding the other party. </i>

466
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,262
<i>- It's a courtesy. </i>
- But not a requirement.

467
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:09,067
- It's not, that's true.
<i>- If Ray Spies interviewed me... </i>

468
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,631
he'd refuse to put me
on the committee even for a minute...

469
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,768
because he'd find out that
when it comes to Laine Hanson...

470
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,336
I went to my dictionary
and crossed off the word "objectivity."

471
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:21,113
Are you suggesting Mrs. Hanson may not
be your first choice for vice president?

472
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:25,418
I'm suggesting that Laine Hanson
has stricken our party
with policies and attitudes...

473
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,357
that are best served
across the aisle from where she came.

474
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:31,953
I take it, like most
members of your party...

475
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,227
your selection would be
Governor Hathaway.

476
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,291
Governor Hathaway's a great man.

477
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:41,065
He's a visionary,
a bona fide hero.

478
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:45,473
- But he withdrew his name
from consideration.
- Minds can be changed.

479
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:50,207
- How much discretion
can I count on from you?
- A hundred percent, sir.

480
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,511
- Even from your own leadership?
- I said a hundred percent.

481
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:57,317
Good. Good man.
Good man.

482
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:01,119
I think if I make the rounds,
do the Sunday morning talk shows...

483
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:04,525
raise the level of the game a bit,
outtalk her on the issues...

484
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:09,363
Issues? What kind of fucking campaigns
are they running in Virginia?

485
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:13,165
Not the kind I'm used to.
Jack, this whole thing
with the girl drowning...

486
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:15,172
It's bullshit!

487
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,403
- I was there, Shelly.
The president told me himself.
<i>- It's an excuse. </i>

488
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:23,140
Jackson Evans has chosen to make
putting a woman in office his swan song.

489
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,843
<i>Laine Hanson is the only</i>
<i>reasonable choice in your party. </i>

490
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:30,479
He's not going with Boxer.
She's too liberal.

491
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,456
He's not going with Jones
because she's older than he is.

492
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:36,584
- There's Winslet.
- She's not coming off
the Supreme Court.

493
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:40,461
<i>Laine Hanson is attractive. </i>
<i>She's a looker. </i>

494
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:44,729
The mere fact that she was
a Republican means that she
can't be too far to the left.

495
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,827
It's a perfect pedigree.

496
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:51,342
We can't get you in by convincing him
you're the right man for the job.

497
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:55,778
We have to convince him that
she's wrong. Once we do that, you're in.

498
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,714
And Toliver,
he's as much as told me...

499
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,944
I'm not going for a low blow.
It's not my way.

500
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,987
You won't have to.

501
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:06,023
<i>We have to go after her. We have</i>
<i>to make her wade in her own blood. </i>

502
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,991
- Who did you say you were?
- I'm Makerowitz.

503
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,824
- Makerowitz.
<i>- I'm sorry. That doesn't</i>
<i>mean much to me. </i>

504
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:15,093
- Web got somebody...
- A friend of the Hathaway campaign.

505
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,964
Who is footing the not-too-unimpressive
bill of Mr. Makerowitz.

506
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,970
<i>Private citizen wants to do</i>
<i>their own investigation... </i>

507
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:24,839
What exactly are you trying to find out?
Campaign irregularities, bribes?

508
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:26,934
- Isn't that the FBI's responsibility?
- Yes, it is.

509
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:30,071
But the FBI would not
find anything. All of her money
is tied up in blind trusts.

510
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:34,812
The kind of improprieties
you're talking about,
I think that only helps her.

511
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:38,913
Personally, I think the nation
would be relieved to know that
just because she's a woman...

512
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,824
<i>-it doesn't mean she can't be</i>
<i>as ruthless as the rest of us. </i>
<i>- Governor? </i>

513
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:46,159
You ever stabbed a man
in the navel? You?

514
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,892
Me? No, I haven't.

515
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,197
Stab a man in the navel,
and that's all she wrote.

516
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,295
Bleeding is so swift and severe,
it wouldn't matter ifJesus put
His healing hand on the wound...

00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,306

<i>the vice presidency. </i>

521
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,423
- Hey, Dog!
- Lewis, how you doin'?

522
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:27,164
- Wow, that's a plate of food!
- [Laughs]

523
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,638
You didn't have
to dress up for me.

524
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:33,108
I had to accompany the senator
to the Gridiron Lunch.

525
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:38,171
lfJohn Q. Public could see
the money that the knuckleheads
that run this country...

526
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:41,013
spend on these lunches,
there would be a second revolution.

527
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:46,523
I'm telling you, there is some money
spent on these stupid lunches.

528
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,056
- What is this?
- It's the reason you're here.

529
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,963
You can't let anybody know
where you got this from.

530
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,695
If Runyon found out
I gave this to you...

531
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,829
he'd fire me,
and I don't want him as an enemy.

532
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:04,602
That's Lainey Hanson
getting gang-banged.

533
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:07,235
Looks like something
out of <i>Hustler. </i>

534
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:10,041
[Sighs]
That's her for sure.

535
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:19,890
I know it's hard to tell with her...
her face in someone's crotch...

536
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:23,051
but that's her, man.

537
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,994
Why are you showing me this?

538
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,794
I will not be party
to an ambush.

539
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,402
Why are you
showing me this, Ted?

540
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,802
Okay.

541
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:42,608
I want out of Runyon's office.
And I thought maybe you could
get me on staff...

542
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,649
This is the best you could
come up with? This shit?

543
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,412
This is shit.

544
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:53,151
Read the deposition

Well, I'm sorry.
I can't do it, not over this.

Let me explain
the big deal to you.

589
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:03,007
The people of this nation
can stomach quite a bit.

590

But one thing they can't stomach
is the image of a vice president

They got the "alleged" slut...

Hey! Let me tell you something.

594
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,762
I'm her husband first.
I don't tolerate talk like that.

595
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:25,598
- Will, calm down.
- You better get used to it, Will.

596
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:29,800
Especially when not even your wife
will defend herself.

597
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:39,309
Give me something, Laine.
Anything.

598
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:43,319
Hell, just deny it.
Why don't you just deny it?

599
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:50,326
It is simply
beneath my dignity.

600
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:09,407
Dignity! Right.

601
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:16,019
We'll just have to make this all
not worthwhile for Mr. Runyon.

Something sexual!

There's no evidence
he ever cheated on his wife.

613
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:49,610
Too bad we're not running in France.
We could really nail him on that one.

When do you have

615

I'm sorry I started.
You were late.

- A minute or two.

- No, sorry. I'm just late.

623
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:41,904
- Hi, Clem. You too.
- Senator, nice to see you.

624
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:44,964
- I ordered you the porterhouse.
- No, I don't eat meat.

625
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:48,341
- I'll have the penne.
- You should really... Mmm.

626
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:51,870

to burn it on the outside.
- No, thank you.

627
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,474
I really don't eat meat.
I'll just go ahead with the penne.

Let's forego
the small talk today, Shelly.

634
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,112
- Mm-hmm.

635

<i>Have you read it? </i>

00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:38,219

<i>- With all due respect... </i>

639
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:40,263
um, Senator...

640
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,266
- It doesn't matter what
I have to say for myself.
<i>- Oh, it doesn't? </i>

641
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:48,966
It seems to me, Mr. Chairman,
all you can claim about me...
<i>claim, </i> is that I had sex...

642
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,234
- Deviant sex.
<i>- Who says it was deviant? </i>

643
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:53,242
I do.

644
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,870
<i>And what I say, the people will believe. </i>
<i>And you know why? </i>

645
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:59,939
Because I'll have a very big microphone
in front of me.

646
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,514
Wow, you must
really hate me, Shelly.

647
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:08,615
<i>I don't hate you. </i>
<i>It's not possible to hate you. You're... </i>

648
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:12,093
What the hell was it that Reynolds
called you the other day?

649
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:15,529
Groovy.
You're a groovy chick.

650
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,365
No, what l, um, do detest

651
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:22,837
<i>I have served this nation</i>
<i>without regard for personal</i>
<i>income for over ten years. </i>

652
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:27,401
<i>You are selfish because you want to take</i>
<i>on a job that positions you to assume... </i>

653
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:29,742
a mantle of gigantic
responsibility...

654
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:32,247
and you do it full well
with the knowledge...

655
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,783
Of what?

656
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,789
<i>What? </i>

657
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:44,292
Greatness is
the orphan of urgency, Laine.

658
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:47,626
Greatness only emerges
when we need it most...

659
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:51,759
in times of war
or calamity.

660
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:55,271
I can't ask somebody
to be a Kennedy or a Lincoln.

661
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:58,069
They were men
created by their times.

662
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:02,306
What I can ask for
is the promise of greatness.

663
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:05,610
And that, Madam Senator...

664
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:07,708
you don't have.

665
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:13,948
Well, then...

666
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:17,152
I just wouldn't be using sex
as leverage...

667
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:20,628
if I were you, Sheldon.

668

<i>Because there's one thing</i>

on the button who isn't getting laid.

670
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:32,235
Will that be the argument the senator
offers up before the committee?

Excuse me. Willie?
Thank you, Willie.

679
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:57,084
Yeah, you betcha. You unseated
that old bastard Bettis.

He must've voted against me
70 percent of the time.

681

You know what this is?
That's a shark steak sandwich.

682
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,764
Fucking shark steak.

683
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:09,033
- You want half?
- Uh, no, thank you.

684
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:13,406
- Are you a vegan? Had lunch?
- No. Uh...

685
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:18,437
So you choose not to break bread with
the president of the United States?

686
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:22,408
[Laughs]
Thank you.

687
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:26,786
When I was in the Senate, Bettis
could always be counted to leave
half a grand at the poker table.

688
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:30,190
Always stayed in, never folded.
Always wanted that miracle card.

689
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,023
- That's good, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

690
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:34,929
Now, Truman,
he was a poker player.

691
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:38,058
Damn fine one,
as I understand it.

692
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,603
Son, I understand you may be
making a mess of our plans...

693
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:43,071
to put Laine Hanson
into the vice president mansion.

694
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,701
Right now, sir, I cannot see
supporting Laine Hanson.

695
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:50,008
- How old are you?
- Me, I'm 28.

696
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:55,985
And at that age and experience,
you think you're the one
to sit and judge Mrs. Hanson?

697
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:58,647
Well, that's the whole point,
isn't it?

698
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:01,190
I am, sir.

699
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:07,996
Mr. Webster,
I'm asking you to lay off...

700
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:10,192
as a personal favor.

701
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,259
It's one thing to break ranks
and vote against my candidate...

702
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:15,999
but to actively attack her
from the bench, that's another.

703
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:18,974
Mr. President, I just don't believe
in Laine Hanson...

704
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:21,476
especially when we have
at our disposal Governor Hathaway.

705
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:23,843
He's a party loyalist
and genuine hero.

706
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:28,283
And I cannot and shall not vote for a
candidate simply because she's a woman.

707
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:31,617
I am nothing if I do not
follow my heart, sir.

708
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,179
I envy you.

709
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,749
I do. You know why?

710
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:41,764
Because someday, years from now, you're
gonna come in here with your family...

711
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:45,097
and you're gonna look up
at my painting...

712
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:48,161
and you'll be able to say to them,
your kids and grandkids...

713
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:52,038
"Way back then

715
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,348
I was on the track
to maybe one day end up here...

716
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:03,409
destined to make the kind of changes
in this country...

717
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,422
that only great men, given the right
time and place, can make...

718
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,950
and I have none of that now,
but that's okay...

719
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:15,362
because I did
what was in my heart."

720
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:19,926
The heart, it can never be wrong,
can it, Mr. Webster?

721
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:27,070
Mmm. Delicious.
You got a little...

722
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:34,046
Hi.

723
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:36,347
<i>I'm Jack Hathaway. </i>
<i>How are you? </i>

724
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:39,981
Hi, sir. Um...

725
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:44,426
<i>Ow. I'm Special Agent Willomina. </i>
<i>Sure is good of you to meet me. </i>

726
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:47,588
It's a pleasure.
How can I help you?

727
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:53,000
I know you're busy, so this
will be as routine as it gets.

728
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:57,131
- Did my girl offer you coffee
or something to drink?
<i>- Oh, yes, she did. </i>

729
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,402
She was very nice, your girl.

730
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:01,535
Yes, she is.
She's very nice.

731
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:05,946
So like I said, I just want to cross
a couple ofT's, little stuff.

732
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:10,009
It's all just part
of the process.

733
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:13,352
By the way, sir, I was real impressed
with your graciousness...

734
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:16,790
- On the whole Senator Hanson thing.
<i>- Oh? </i>

735
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,158
<i>You know, in supporting her. </i>
<i>Real gracious. </i>

736
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:23,632
Well, as you know, I withdrew my name
from consideration.

737
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,361
<i>Right. Right. </i>

738
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:29,303
And I think she's a real fine choice.
Anybody that knows her knows that.

739
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:32,467
How long have you known her?

740
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:36,706
- Oh, well, actually, I don't really...
<i>- I'm sorry. </i>

741
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,975
When you said,
"Anybody that knows her"...

742
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:42,212
<i>- I know people who know her. </i>
- Uh-huh.

743
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:46,552
- I'm happy to give you
their names, if you'd like.
<i>- Great. </i>

744
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:50,582
I don't really know her, but I've
seen her several times at functions...

745
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:55,462
and, uh, I think
she'll do a real good job.

746
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,534
Sir, can I just say that...

747
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,470
I was really hoping
you'd go for the position...

748
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,769
especially after what happened
on the Apachaway.

749
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:06,866
I think people would think,
in the back of their minds...

750
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:11,347
"This here's a guy who takes risks
when the right thing's at stake."

751
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:15,044
- Lifesaver?
- No, thanks.

752
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:19,214
Anyway, some real bad luck,
your being right there.

753
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,689
Not if I'd been able
to save her.

754
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:26,422
No, no, in the crabbing area.

755
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:29,624
<i>It's just that</i>
<i>you were fishing for bass, so... </i>

756
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,227
- That probably explains why
we didn't catch anything.
<i>-[Laughing]</i>

757
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:38,741
You fish in the Apachaway
a lot, so I thought that
you would know that, but...

758
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,902
I don't fish a lot.

759
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:45,039
- I thought your equipment
was pretty sophisticated, but...
<i>- There's a difference... </i>

760
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,583
between wanting to fish
and having time to fish.

761
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,175
Tell me about it.

762
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:54,121
<i>-And he freed the slaves</i>
<i>and won the Civil War. </i>
<i>- That's right! </i>

763
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:56,182
<i>He was probably</i>
<i>our greatest president. </i>

764
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:59,956
- Even greater than George Washington?
- It's a running debate.

765
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:03,261
- Laine Hanson.
- Oh, Mr. President.

766
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,893
And you must be
one Timothy Hanson.

767
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:09,700
- Timothy Muskie Hanson.
- [Chuckles]

768
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:13,834
Well, Timothy Muskie Hanson, how would
you like a great big cookie? Any kind.

769
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,470
- No, thank you.
<i>-Any kind at all. </i>

770
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,173
Oatmeal, white chocolate...

771
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:20,773
Actually, we just had dinner,
but thanks.

772
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:24,514
In that case, shall we have
our picture taken, young man? Hmm?

773
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:28,786
- How do I look?
<i>- Your tie's a little crooked. </i>

774
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:32,351
Well, can't take a picture like that.
Will you straighten it for me?

775
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,466
Your mommy tells me you know more about
the presidents than most grown-ups.

776
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,564
- I like to study them.
- Mmm! Me too.

777
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:47,337
<i>I think we're ready</i>
<i>for business, Dennis. </i>

778
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:50,744
- Sir.
- You must be very proud of your mom.

779
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:54,614
Yeah, being the vice president
is better than being the president.

780
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:56,948
Oh, I'm sure you're right.

781
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,512
'Cause nobody wants to shoot
the vice president.

782
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:06,290
So, you must be feeling
pretty excited about now. Please sit.

783
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:09,161
- Hmm?
- Well, I think I'm a little nervous.

784
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:12,497
Well, good! Good.
Night before a confirmation hearing.

785
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,299
Anything else,
I would've withdrawn your name.

786
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:18,569
- What about this Webster, sir?
- Ah, one second. Anybody here hungry?

787
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:21,839
- No, thanks.
- No, sir, I'm not. Thanks.

788
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:27,248
Otto, could you whip up some
Kung Pao chicken, but with walnuts?

789
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:29,251
[Otto Over Intercom]
No problem, sir.

790
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:33,449
Ah, the kid. Met him. You know
this young congressman, Webster?

791
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:35,889
No, sir, I don't.

792
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:40,919
No matter. He reminds me of me
when I was his age. That's bad.

793
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:46,929
K, you need to put out word
that no matter what this kid does...

794
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:49,267
nobody's to give him
a hard time.

795
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:53,275
He's misguided, but he's got something.
And one day, who knows?

796
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:57,871
All right, sir. I'm sure the senator
can handle Mr. Webster.

Yes, sir. You got him
a leather-bound Don Quixote.

00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:24,405
Oh, good. Good gift.
Metaphorical gift.

805

He'll be trying to figure out
why I got him that forever.

Ah, were you married
at the time?

807
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:33,671
Uh, I was a freshman in...

808
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:37,015
You know, sir, I'm just not going
to comment on the whole thing.

809
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:39,146
It's beneath me
and it's beneath the press.

810

<i>That's the way to go. Fuck the press. </i>

<i>- It's perfect. </i>
- Maybe I was too rough
on Shelly in Hartford.

812
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:51,632
Then this would all be moot,
'cause you wouldn't be president, sir.

Married, unmarried, One guy, two guys,

Who the fuck cares?

816

You just look those bastards
in the eye and tell them exactly that.

These guys,
they're gonna confirm you.

818

But they want to embarrass you
in the process.

819
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,685
They want to send you into
this administration as a virus.

820
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:15,691
So you have only one choice.

821
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:20,355

a new birth

And sometimes in this process...

828
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:48,650
you will question
even yourselves.

829
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,751
And that's good,
that's healthy.

For what are we

<i>A cancer of liberalism. </i>

Clausewitz said that war
is the natural extension of politics.

00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:20,200

important matter be handled with...

860
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:22,437
expedition and dignity.

861
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:26,039
We are proud to welcome
our friend and colleague, Laine Hanson.

862
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:29,677
<i>Madam Senator, </i>
<i>I welcome you. </i>

863
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:33,917
Thank you, Mr<i>... . </i>
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

864
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:38,859
<i>Will the "gentlelady"from Ohio</i>
<i>please rise and raise your right hand? </i>

865
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:44,525
<i>Madam Senator, </i>
<i>do you swear to tell the truth... </i>

866
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:46,899
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

867
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,904
- I do.
<i>- Please be seated. </i>

868
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:51,099
<i>Mr. Chairman, point of order. </i>

869
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:54,143
<i>The Chair recognizes</i>
<i>Mr. Webster of Delaware. </i>

870
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:57,338
Mr. Chairman, I direct
your attention to page 16...

871
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:01,612
<i>tab C-25 of the ledger, </i>
<i>a transcript of the Q-and-A session... </i>

872
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:04,209
<i>between the nominee and several students</i>
<i>from Harvard University. </i>

873
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:08,656
<i>- Page 16? </i>
<i>- Page 16 at the bottom of the page. </i>

874
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:11,285
<i>You'll see the following remarks</i>
<i>in reference to a question... </i>

875
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:13,591
regarding the separation
of church and state.

876
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:16,131
The nominee said, and I quote,
"The separation exists...

877
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,861
because we cannot have a fairy tale
govern a nation."

878
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,665
What, sir, is the point?

879
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:24,400
The senator just swore an oath
to an entity she does not believe in.

880
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:28,308
<i>Madam Senator, </i>
<i>you understand... </i>

881
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:31,472
that you have promised
to be truthful to this committee?

882
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:36,315
<i>-And that lying to this body</i>
<i>is perjury, punishable by law? </i>
- Yes, I do understand that.

883
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,923
Well, I think
we're all agreed...

884
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:45,859
that even though the senator
has shown a disdain...

885
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:48,489
for religion
and those practicing it...

886
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:51,363
which is her constitutional right...

887
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:54,096
<i>that does not necessarily, </i>
<i>Mr. Webster, make her a liar. </i>

888
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:57,367
I'm confident we can proceed.

889
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,635
<i>- Madam? </i>
- Yes?

890
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:02,576
<i>For the record, would you</i>
<i>state your name and address? </i>

891
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,237
Yes. My name is Laine Hanson.

892
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,111
<i>My address is... </i>

893
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,779
<i>[Woman] You can just do that, </i>
<i>pull phone records? </i>

894
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:12,014
<i>[Willomina] I work</i>
<i>for a pretty powerful guy. </i>

895
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:16,525
<i>[Woman] Yeah, we're close, </i>
<i>we were close for a while. </i>

896
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:22,054
That's till recently, of course.
Our career paths sort of went
in different directions.

897
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:26,261
At least you have your life.
There's nothing sinister going on here.

898
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,270
At this point,
we just need...

899
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:32,035
to look at every aspect of her life
and find everyone that knew her.

900
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:34,167
You never know
what you're gonna find.

901
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:37,145
- Did you find anything?
- No, no, not really.

902
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:39,044
Not really?
You mean...

903
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:41,049
A little bit, actually.

904
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:44,052
I did speak to other classmates,
and they told me she was pretty wild.

905
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,054
Wild? Yeah, she was wild.

906
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:48,852
Wild enough you can be sure the tabloids
are gonna have a field day.

907
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:50,790
Have you spoken to them?

908
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:54,626
Um, me? No.
But somebody somewhere's gonna talk.

909
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:58,633
- But not you.
- Uh-uh, no.

910
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:02,296
- It's okay if you have.
We're not gonna lock you up.
- No, I haven't.

911
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:08,775
So no one like,
maybe, the <i>National Enquirer... </i>

912
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:11,712
or one of those
silly television programs...

913
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:14,511
- That show, um<i>... Access... </i>
<i>- Confidential? </i>

914
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:17,553
No, no, no.
I don't know anything.

915
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,986
The last time I talked to her it
was just, "The kid this, the kid that."

916
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:25,926
According to our records,
you spoke to her on the 15th.

917
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:28,054
- Three weeks ago?
- Yeah.

918
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:30,326
Yeah, that makes sense.

919
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,062
l... She was going to Vegas.

920
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:35,366
Oh, is that right? Vegas?

921
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:38,339
She asked me to go along with her.
It was gonna be her treat.

922
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,342
I couldn't go
because I had to work.

923
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:44,676
We were gonna stay at one of those
ritzy new places. The, um, Bellage...?

924
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:47,614
- The Bellagio? Right.
- Yeah.

925
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:50,585
- With the contortionist.
- I've never been.

926
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:59,154
You've been going through my desk.

927
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,169
<i>It never crossed my mind</i>
<i>when I was a younger woman... </i>

928
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:11,934
<i>that I'd be this age</i>
<i>and not have kids. </i>

929
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:14,841
Somehow in my mind, kids.

930
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:17,744
Raising them,
making them good people.

931

That's what I wanted.

932
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:22,711

and I realized that I'd be...

933

she accepted money...

the minds of Americans over the weekend.

Where'd they get the story?

Well, is there any truth

1028
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:14,727

1029
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,602

Let her deny just that part
of the story.

1031

- Hold here.
- What? Oh.

1032

That's all right.
I can do that myself. Yeah.

and you were to have a child
during your term.

1122

Would you cede your duties

the House to run for the Senate.

a crime in our armed forces.

1148

But while it is a law,
it should be enforced

Perhaps the senator is unaware
that commander in chief
is not actually a military rank.

<i>I am aware of that. </i>

Hank was sitting where Len is.

1171

Hank's a hothead,

If we were threatening him,
he'd know it.

That's what I thought,

So, what can I do for you,
Mr. Webster?

1184
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:47,307
I'm sure you're wondering
why I'm here.

1185
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:50,004
I think you're here because you want
to know why I'm not fighting back.

You're kicking my ass.
It's gone from feeling like
easy pickings to out-and-out bullying.

1188
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:01,350
I feel like there should be
some back and forth between us,
you and the committee.

1189
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:04,915
<i>I'll give you back and forth on Social</i>

on the Dow Jones, the census,
almost everything, but not this.

1191

No, not my personal life.
It's just nobody's business.

1192

That's not what the people
will tell you; the people will
tell you it is their business...

Especially their girls.

1195

Have you ever heard
of Isaac Lamm?

1196
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:28,750
- Isaac Lamm? No.
<i>- He was the first one</i>

Activities Committee.

1198
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:35,420
He was also the first one to name names,
first to cooperate with the government.

1199
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:37,458
The dominoes fell from there.

if Mr. Lamm had just said,
"Fuck you," to the committee.

1202
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:47,160
Imagine how much harder
he would've made it for them.

1203
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:51,695
Are you accusing the committee
of sexual McCarthyism?

1204
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:55,675
Well, it's not necessary
to make the accusation.

1205
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:59,544
Oh, I just can't respond
to the committee's lightly
veiled accusations...

1206
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,845
because it's not okay
for them to be made.

1207
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:06,718
Or maybe you can't respond
because the answers you have
to give are too embarrassing.

1208
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,058
You know what?

1209
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:12,059

I'm gonna spell it out
for you even more clearly.

"Mr. Runyon, 20 years ago

Mr. Marshall, the vice president
does not appoint Supreme Court justices.

Should you succeed the president
or even advise the president?

pro-life from serving on the High Court.

1242

So you would allow a personal political
belief to enter into such a decision?

1243

Abortion isn't

1254
01:19:50,418 --> 01:19:53,876
I have a propensity

Personally, Senator...

1258

- Right, putting stick.

1277

- Business, sir.
- Vegas is business?

1279
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:52,740

That's her casino account balance.

She offered to take her sorority sister

Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth so help you God?

1285
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:26,274
I do.

1286
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:31,904
<i>Please state your name</i>
<i>for the record. </i>

1287
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:36,383
Cynthia C-H-A-R-L-T-O-N Lee.

1288
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:39,852
<i>Thank you. </i>
<i>Please be seated. </i>

1289
01:22:41,423 --> 01:22:47,191
<i>We will start the questioning</i>
<i>with Mr. Skakle. </i>

1290
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:50,595
<i>Mr. Skakle, the five-minute rule</i>
<i>is in effect. </i>

1291
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:53,429
<i>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </i>

1292
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:56,061
<i>Miss Lee. </i>

1293
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:59,937
Miss Lee, hello. I'm over here.
Thank you for joining us.

1294
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:03,705
Now, you are under subpoena,
is that correct?

1295
01:23:03,778 --> 01:23:05,837
Yes.

1296
01:23:05,914 --> 01:23:10,044
<i>- Miss Lee, could you speak</i>
<i>directly into the mike? </i>
- Yes.

1297
01:23:10,118 --> 01:23:13,417
<i>I understand you're nervous, but believe</i>
<i>me when I tell you you're among friends. </i>

1298
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:17,421
<i>Miss Lee, you are not married. </i>

1299
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:20,086
No... No.

1300
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:22,857
- No, I'm not.
<i>- But you once were. </i>

1301
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:25,593
I was married
to William Hanson.

1302
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:28,932
- Who is now married to the nominee.
<i>- Yes. </i>

1303
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:33,338
He married Laine after our divorce.
It was about seven years ago.

1304
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:36,275
<i>Divorce. Right. </i>
<i>I've read your divorce papers. </i>

1305
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:40,781
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, </i>
<i>that by the way is tab 76.</i>

1306
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:43,682
<i>They cite</i>
<i>irreconcilable differences. </i>

1307
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:48,155
<i>Could you tell us, what were</i>
<i>those irreconcilable differences? </i>

1308
01:23:48,223 --> 01:23:50,123
I can't really pinpoint them.

1309
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:54,150
<i>- Was your husband</i>
<i>physically violent to you? </i>
- No.

1310
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:58,495
<i>Did you have financial</i>
<i>disagreements or disagreements</i>
<i>over how to raise your kids? </i>

1311
01:23:58,566 --> 01:24:00,534
We didn't have children.

1312
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:05,096
<i>- Were there infidelities? </i>
- Yes. There was one.

1313
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:08,939
<i>Is it safe to say that this infidelity</i>
<i>precipitated the divorce? </i>

1314
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:16,445
Miss Lee, please answer
the question verbally. Was that a yes?

1315
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:19,646
Yes, it was.
It was a yes.

1316
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:22,656
<i>- Did you, ma'am, have the affair? </i>
- No.

1317
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:25,352
- It was your husband then?
- Yes.

1318
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:28,726
Will...
Will was in charge...

1319
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:33,461
<i>of Laine Billings's</i>
<i>first senatorial campaign. </i>

1320
01:24:33,535 --> 01:24:35,560
He was with her all the time.

1321
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:39,368
Are you suggesting the senator,
the nominee, had an affair
with your husband?

1322
01:24:42,043 --> 01:24:44,671
- Once again, Miss Lee...
- I'm sorry. Yes. Yes, yes.

1323
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:46,680
<i>Thank you. </i>

1324
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:48,978
Did the nominee know
Mr. Hanson was married?

1325
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:54,050
Laine was my friend.
My good, good friend.

1326
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:57,182
<i>Miss Lee, would you explain</i>
<i>to this committee as you</i>
<i>did in your deposition... </i>

1327
01:24:57,258 --> 01:25:01,820
<i>how you discovered</i>
<i>that the nominee was involved... </i>

1328
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:04,262
in an affair
with your husband?

1329
01:25:04,332 --> 01:25:07,597
Yes. Um...

1330
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:11,105
On the night of the elections,
I was at home.

1331
01:25:11,172 --> 01:25:13,436
I had the flu.

1332
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:18,536
I was watching TV, watching Laine
about to make her acceptance speech.

1333
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:23,245
I was very sad
that I couldn't be there.

1334
01:25:23,318 --> 01:25:27,015
It was a triumph
for Laine and my husband.

1335
01:25:27,088 --> 01:25:31,024
<i>She was up at the podium. </i>
<i>Will was by her side. </i>

1336
01:25:31,092 --> 01:25:33,583
<i>He was holding her hand</i>
<i>in victory. </i>

1337
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:36,255
<i>On the other side</i>
<i>of Laine... </i>

1338
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:39,732
<i>she was just sort of clasping</i>
<i>that person's hand. </i>

1339
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:43,237
<i>But with Will... </i>

1340
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:45,966
their hands were interlaced.

1341
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:49,339
It was odd
that I noticed it, but...

1342
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:52,311
Um, my doorbell rang.

1343
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:55,474
I answered the door,
and there was a gentleman there...

1344
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:59,646
dressed very nicely,
he had a yellow tie on.

1345
01:25:59,721 --> 01:26:01,951
He had papers for me.

1346
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:05,049
<i>- Papers? I'm sorry. </i>
- Separation papers.

1347
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:09,825
<i>Since the committee</i>
<i>chose to humiliate a private woman</i>
<i>in the most public possible setting... </i>

1348
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:12,696
I would like to apologize
to her alike...

1349
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:16,498
and I will also do so privately
when she allows me to do so.

1350
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:20,940
Um, what I did to Miss Lee
was wrong.

1351
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:23,876
It was not done out of malice.
Indeed the opposite.

1352
01:26:23,945 --> 01:26:26,971
Um...

1353
01:26:27,048 --> 01:26:31,451
Iove is an involuntary reflex,
and I fell victim to it.

1354
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:35,751
Um, I deeply regret
causing Cynthia pain...

1355
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:39,782
and it is especially saddening
for me because...

1356
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:43,319
of how close we once were.

1357
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:47,494
And whether or not the affair
that Will and I had...

1358
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:50,333
should have any bearing on my assuming
office is for the committee to decide.

1359
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:55,342
I dare not assume that I have
the objective wisdom to make
that determination. Thank you.

1360
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:58,902
- Senator,
are you suggesting the public...
- Okay, she's had a long day.

1361
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:01,216
You know what she's going through.
Come on, come on.

1362
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:02,376
You know what she's going through.
Come on, come on.

1363
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:04,543
She was your best friend.

1364
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:08,988
<i>Runyon deposed Will's</i>
<i>ex-wife today, and, uh... </i>

1365
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:11,525
she stated that Will and I
had had an affair...

1366
01:27:11,593 --> 01:27:14,926
She saw her fucking holding hands,
interlocked fingers with this gal...

1367
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:16,930
and she knew
that she'd been fucking him.

1368
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:18,989
That's what she said.

1369
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:21,535
<i>- I'm sorry. </i>
<i>-[Newman] It's a bad beat. </i>

1370
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:26,597
I'm not sure that I get
the point of all this.

1371
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:30,508
- You said under oath
that you never committed adultery.
- That's right.

1372
01:27:30,578 --> 01:27:34,036
<i>- You perjured yourself. </i>
- I didn't commit adultery.

1373
01:27:34,115 --> 01:27:35,878
- You were fucking Will
when he was married.
- All right.

1374
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:40,046
<i>Even the most loose definition</i>
<i>of committing adultery</i>
<i>would not include that. </i>

1375
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:42,589
Goddamn it, she's right.
You're right.

1376
01:27:42,657 --> 01:27:46,388
<i>In order for it to be</i>
<i>committing adultery, she'd have</i>
<i>to be married at the time. </i>

1377
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:48,395
<i>You're nitpicking</i>
<i>in reverse now. </i>

1378
01:27:48,463 --> 01:27:50,658
<i>Your husband may have been</i>
<i>an adulterer. You're not. Fine. </i>

1379
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:55,601
What you are is a sex-crazed,
home-wrecking machine.
The female Warren Beatty.

1380
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:59,071
Runyon knows
that you're clean of the perjury...

1381
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:03,133
but he's got the world thinking you're
something out of a bad soap opera.

1382
01:28:03,211 --> 01:28:08,171
You've goddamned crystallized
the difference between being
guilty and being responsible.

1383
01:28:08,249 --> 01:28:10,376
Are you asking me
to step down, sir?

1384
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:14,911
No, it's not gonna be
that easy for you, and it's not
gonna be that easy for them.

1385
01:28:17,091 --> 01:28:20,788
They caught you being
a human being. That's all.

1386
01:28:22,997 --> 01:28:25,227
I'll die before Shelly Runyon
checkmates me.

1387
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:29,066
<i>I think the president's trying to say</i>
<i>the Sitting Bull routine isn't working. </i>

1388
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:32,573
- The Sitting Bull routine?
- No!

1389
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:38,678
Fight back.

1390
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:42,910
Show them Laine Hanson isn't gonna take
their shit. Take the fight out of'em.

1391
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:44,815
- What's the process?
- Confess.

1392
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:47,650
- Confess?
<i>- Yeah, confess. </i>
- Confess.

1393
01:28:47,722 --> 01:28:50,316
Confess to the gang-bang.
Confess to all of it.

1394

<i>-[Evans] Look what it did</i>
<i>for Clinton with Flowers. </i>

It didn't hurt his numbers.
It improved his numbers.

1396
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:59,500
Show indignation about how a man
would never have to go through
hell for having done this.

1397
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:02,092
<i>Confess and demonstrate</i>
<i>to the young women of America... </i>

<i>can ruin their lives. </i>

1399

Confess and preach about the dangers

For God's sakes, just confess!

I understand, Kermit, truly.

1402
01:29:20,488 --> 01:29:23,480
I understand, and you know what?
It's really nobody's business.

1403
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:27,392
<i>Well, it is</i>
<i>our fucking business! </i>

1405
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,906
I don't care who you fucked...

1406

and how many times
in how many positions...

1407
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:51,614
as long as it doesn't threaten
the administration.

1408

<i>You can be cavalier</i>

[Sighs]

1411
01:30:15,376 --> 01:30:21,246
I am fully prepared
to step down...

1412
01:30:21,315 --> 01:30:24,250
but my personal life...

1413

1414
01:30:29,357 --> 01:30:31,484
are just that.

1415
01:30:31,559 --> 01:30:35,359
But I will do
whatever you say.

1416
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:45,128
Show them why Laine Hanson is my nominee
with your closing statement.

1417
01:30:45,206 --> 01:30:47,436
Mr. Chairman...

1418
01:30:47,508 --> 01:30:50,841
ladies and gentlemen
of the committee:

1419
01:30:50,912 --> 01:30:55,542
Uh, remarkably enough, it seems
that I have some explaining to do.

1420
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:59,484
So...
let me be absolutely clear.

1421
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:10,194
I stand for a woman's right
to choose.

1422
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:14,325
I stand for the elimination
of the death penalty.

1423
01:31:14,402 --> 01:31:17,428
I stand for a strong
and growing armed forces...

1424
01:31:17,505 --> 01:31:21,498
because we must stomp out genocide
on this planet...

1425
01:31:21,576 --> 01:31:25,239
and I believe that that
is a cause worth dying for.

1426
01:31:26,781 --> 01:31:31,411
I stand for seeing every gun
taken out of every home. Period.

1427
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:36,514
I stand for making
the selling of cigarettes
to our youth a federal offense.

1428
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:41,756
I stand for term limits
and campaign reform.

1429
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:46,562
And, Mr. Chairman, I stand for
the separation of church and state...

1430
01:31:46,634 --> 01:31:51,503
and the reason that I stand
for that is the same reason that
I believe our forefathers did.

1431
01:31:51,572 --> 01:31:54,871
It is not there to protect religion
from the grasp of government...

1432
01:31:54,942 --> 01:31:59,311
but to protect our government
from the grasp of religious fanaticism.

1433
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:01,974
I may be an atheist...

1434
01:32:02,049 --> 01:32:06,383
but that does not mean I do not
go to church; I do go to church.

1435
01:32:06,454 --> 01:32:09,981
The church I go to is the one
that emancipated the slaves...

1436
01:32:10,057 --> 01:32:12,525
that gave women
the right to vote.

1437
01:32:12,593 --> 01:32:17,826
It gave us every freedom
that we hold dear.

1438
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:21,665
My church is this very chapel
of democracy that we sit in together...

1439
01:32:21,736 --> 01:32:24,899
and I do not need God to tell me
what are my moral absolutes.

1440
01:32:24,972 --> 01:32:27,270
I need my heart,
my brain and this church.

1441
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:35,841
Get in there, get in there.

1442
01:32:37,418 --> 01:32:41,013
Oh, shoot!
Come on, come on, come on!

1443
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:44,888
- Senator? Oh...
- Hello, Freshman.

1444
01:32:44,959 --> 01:32:47,257
Senator, I just wanted
to steal a couple of seconds.

1445
01:32:47,328 --> 01:32:50,491
What? See what whores do
on their time off?

1446
01:32:53,968 --> 01:32:57,369
Listen,
I know the things I've done.

1447
01:32:57,438 --> 01:33:00,566
They may not have been nice
or considered politically savvy...

1448
01:33:00,641 --> 01:33:04,737
but they have served the greater good
and they have been honest.

1449
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:06,575
[Chuckles]
Okay.

1450
01:33:06,647 --> 01:33:09,275
Look, I know
you're not a whore.

1451
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:11,614
- I'm not gonna talk about it.
<i>- I know. You're not talking about it. </i>

1452
01:33:14,055 --> 01:33:16,353
Somebody else
has come forward.

1453
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:19,689
Somebody else from the night
of the incident sent me this letter.

1454
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,694
<i>They didn't send it to me. </i>
<i>They sent it to the committee. </i>

1455
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:24,287
<i>I just happen to be in charge</i>
<i>of all the correspondence. </i>

1456
01:33:24,365 --> 01:33:28,062
I don't think you can keep quiet
about what's in there.

1457
01:33:28,135 --> 01:33:32,538
Mr. Runyon has a copy,
and now so do you.

1458
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:35,872
<i>I beg you, Senator, </i>
<i>to deal with this. </i>

1459
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:41,108
- How long is this flight?
- About an hour and 40 minutes.

1460
01:33:41,182 --> 01:33:45,346
POTUS is scheduled to address
the American Legion on the third.

1461
01:33:45,419 --> 01:33:48,183
- American Legion? Who approved that?
<i>- I don't know. </i>

1462
01:33:48,255 --> 01:33:50,883
- I thought he had
the D.A.R. dinner that night.
- We have a five-hour window.

1463
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:52,721
- Hey, Chuck.
- Hey, Kermit.

1464
01:33:52,793 --> 01:33:54,727
Did you get the AP reports?

1465
01:33:54,795 --> 01:33:59,528
- What's that?
- POTUS's poll numbers are down 23%.

1466
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:03,468
- And Hanson's in the low 30s.
- Get in there.
I'll talk to you in a minute.

1467
01:34:03,537 --> 01:34:06,438
- Are you Willomina?
- Yes, sir.

1468
01:34:08,209 --> 01:34:10,143
You asked to see me?

1469
01:34:10,211 --> 01:34:13,510
- Is this your handiwork?
- Yes, sir.

1470
01:34:13,581 --> 01:34:17,677
- How many people have seen this?
- I gave it only to the director.

1471
01:34:17,752 --> 01:34:21,483
- And who have you talked to about this?
- Nobody.

1472
01:34:21,555 --> 01:34:24,319
Not a husband? Boyfriend?

1473
01:34:24,392 --> 01:34:28,590
- Grandma in Kalamazoo?
- No, sir. Nobody.

1474
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:32,121
- Keep it that way.
<i>- Yes, sir. </i>

1475
01:34:32,199 --> 01:34:35,032
You did a good job,
Special Agent.

1476
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:43,375
Sir! Uh, sir, I just... I just wanted
to ask, ask you. Um, well...

1477
01:34:43,444 --> 01:34:46,174
Are you gonna dump her?

1478
01:34:46,247 --> 01:34:49,114
<i>Sir, this may be really, </i>
<i>really inappropriate... </i>

1479
01:34:49,183 --> 01:34:51,845
but if that's what you guys
are thinking...

1480
01:34:51,919 --> 01:34:55,548
<i>Please, you can't do it. </i>
<i>She's hope. </i>

1481
01:34:55,623 --> 01:34:59,320
Hope that the standards...
That there is no double standard.

1482
01:34:59,393 --> 01:35:01,987
Hope that the goals
can be the same.

1483
01:35:03,464 --> 01:35:06,365
You know what?
You're goddamn right.

1484
01:35:07,435 --> 01:35:10,734
That was absolutely inappropriate.

1485
01:35:10,805 --> 01:35:13,137
Robertson.

1486
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,880
<i>[Runyon]</i>
<i>I wouldn't take it too hard. </i>

1487
01:35:28,956 --> 01:35:31,049
<i>It's not exactly fair</i>
<i>when six foxes and one chicken... </i>

1488
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:33,889
<i>are voting on</i>
<i>what to have for dinner. </i>

1489
01:35:33,961 --> 01:35:37,863
<i>[Evans] Well, that's not</i>
<i>playing fair. I'll give you that. </i>

1490
01:35:37,932 --> 01:35:40,162
<i>You want an oatmeal cookie? </i>

1491
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:41,895
- Trevor?
<i>- I'm getting them, sir. </i>

1492
01:35:41,969 --> 01:35:46,269
<i>I find these giant raisins... </i>
<i>Well, you'll see. </i>

1493
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:48,433
Taste like grapes.

1494
01:35:54,882 --> 01:35:58,443
Shelly, you really made
a mess of things for me.

1495
01:35:58,519 --> 01:36:00,851
You sure did clobber me.

1496
01:36:04,191 --> 01:36:08,719
Isn't it possible, sir,
that I was... that I was acting...

1497
01:36:08,796 --> 01:36:11,128
- In the best interests
of the United States?
<i>- No. </i>

1498
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:13,632
It's not possible.

1499
01:36:13,701 --> 01:36:17,102
That's what pisses me off. It's all
about retribution for Hartford.

1500
01:36:17,171 --> 01:36:19,662
Thank you, Trevor.
That'll be all.

1501
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:23,836
- Go ahead. Try this. It's wonderful.
- No.

1502
01:36:23,911 --> 01:36:28,280
I may have taken the presidency
from you, but you one-upped me.

1503
01:36:28,349 --> 01:36:31,409
You took away my legacy.

1504
01:36:31,485 --> 01:36:34,818
I look at her and I see someone who
has proven the capacity for disloyalty.

1505
01:36:34,889 --> 01:36:36,880
Or the capacity
for seeing the light.

1506
01:36:38,959 --> 01:36:41,120
We're both sticking
to our guns.

1507
01:36:41,195 --> 01:36:44,255
The difference is...
mine are loaded.

1508
01:36:44,331 --> 01:36:49,633
<i>Look, it doesn't matter, does it? </i>
<i>She's not being confirmed. </i>

1509
01:36:49,703 --> 01:36:53,833
We can talk for days
about greatness and leadership...

1510
01:36:53,908 --> 01:36:56,433
<i>but Laine Hanson</i>
<i>will not be confirmed. </i>

1511
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:59,911
I have seven from your side
who are giving her the ax.

1512
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:01,948
Oh, indeed, the ax?

1513
01:37:02,016 --> 01:37:03,950
<i>We can go through</i>
<i>the process of a vote. </i>

1514
01:37:04,018 --> 01:37:05,610
<i>You can waste time... </i>

1515
01:37:05,686 --> 01:37:10,453
and suffer the humiliation,
or... or we can just move on.

1516
01:37:10,524 --> 01:37:12,583
- There's a lot of good folk
to choose from.
<i>- Who? </i>

1517
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:14,924
Who can I be certain
you'll confirm?

1518
01:37:14,995 --> 01:37:19,125
The man you wanted in the first place:
Jack Hathaway.

1519
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:23,269
Shelly.

1520
01:37:24,872 --> 01:37:26,840
<i>Good man. </i>

1521
01:37:37,618 --> 01:37:40,678
Okay, Shelly...

1522
01:37:40,754 --> 01:37:45,782
I'll give you GovernorJack Hathaway,
but I wanna make damn sure...

1523
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:49,227
<i>-you'll give him a smooth ride. </i>
- My word. There's a reason
they call me Honest Shell.

1524
01:37:49,296 --> 01:37:53,232
Irony, Shelly.
I want an insurance policy.

1525
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:56,201
I want a piece of the rock.
I wanna make sure...

1526
01:37:56,270 --> 01:37:58,568
<i>you're not gonna pull</i>
<i>some kind of baloney out of your hat... </i>

1527
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:00,903
<i>and make a mockery</i>
<i>of my administration again. </i>

1528
01:38:00,975 --> 01:38:03,466
<i>Listen. This is</i>
<i>what I'm gonna do. </i>

1529
01:38:05,846 --> 01:38:10,442
I'm gonna ask Mrs. Hanson and
Mr. Hathaway up to the Oval Office...

1530
01:38:10,517 --> 01:38:13,111
before the D.A.R. banquet
tomorrow night.

1531
01:38:13,187 --> 01:38:15,382
<i>I want you there as well, </i>
<i>but, Shelly... </i>

1532
01:38:15,456 --> 01:38:19,483
before then, I need you
to marry yourself to this guy.

1533
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:23,860
<i>I need you to make a public statement</i>
<i>that makes his sinking your sinking. </i>

1534
01:38:23,931 --> 01:38:26,491
<i>- Otherwise... </i>
- But I'm not sure I can...

1535
01:38:26,567 --> 01:38:29,934
Let's make this confirmation
fast and furious.

1536
01:38:30,004 --> 01:38:32,871
- Help me save face on this one.
- Okay.

1537
01:38:46,854 --> 01:38:50,881
<i>Oh, man. Mr. Runyon, </i>
<i>prefer I take you around back? </i>

1538
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:54,894
- No, I'll be fine.
<i>- Yes, sir. </i>

1539
01:39:05,539 --> 01:39:10,738
How do you respond to the rumors
that Mrs. Hanson has withdrawn her name?

1540
01:39:10,811 --> 01:39:12,802
That is a rumor
I've not yet heard.

1541
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:15,280
Have you heard about the possibility
of Governor Hathaway...

1542
01:39:15,349 --> 01:39:18,978
- Returning to the list
of vice presidential...
- Governor Hathaway is a fine man.

1543
01:39:19,053 --> 01:39:21,385
<i>Will he have a smoother ride</i>
<i>than Mrs. Hanson? </i>

1544
01:39:21,455 --> 01:39:23,980
Let me go on record
as saying...

1545
01:39:24,058 --> 01:39:27,755
that in my opinion there is
no man alive... no Democrat alive...

1546
01:39:27,828 --> 01:39:30,661
who could bring...

1547
01:39:30,731 --> 01:39:34,531
more integrity
to the office of the vice presidency.

1548
01:39:34,601 --> 01:39:38,059
I would stake my career...

1549
01:39:38,138 --> 01:39:42,802
on Governor Hathaway's, uh,
smooth and efficient confirmation.

1550
01:39:42,876 --> 01:39:45,811
<i>[Runyon]</i>
<i>As for Laine Hanson... </i>

1551
01:39:45,879 --> 01:39:49,474
- Got everybody, Glenda?
<i>- Yes, sir. He says you can</i>
<i>go in whenever you're ready. </i>

1552
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:51,780

1553
01:39:51,852 --> 01:39:55,720

particularly fetching this evening.
- Thank you, sir.

1554
01:39:55,789 --> 01:39:59,350

- Yes.

- Hello, Shelly.
- Newman.

1557
01:40:05,032 --> 01:40:09,765
Everybody would understand if you
wanted to delay for two weeks.

1558
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:13,170
I'm not sure I could stomach
another two weeks.

1559
01:40:14,241 --> 01:40:17,301
Oh, Jack.

1560
01:40:17,378 --> 01:40:21,075
- Jerry. Good.
- How are you?

1561
01:40:21,148 --> 01:40:23,207
Mr. Hanson.

1562

<i>-[Evans] Gentlemen. Jack. </i>

There he is! Shelly!

1564

Hello, Mr. President.

01:40:31,992 --> 01:40:34,017
Uh, you know what?

1566
01:40:34,094 --> 01:40:36,688
Before we get started...

1567
01:40:36,764 --> 01:40:39,164
I can't stomach the idea...

1568
01:40:39,233 --> 01:40:42,225
of touching that chichi food we always
get served at these state dinners.

1569
01:40:42,302 --> 01:40:44,236
- Glenda?
<i>- Yes, sir? </i>

1570
01:40:44,304 --> 01:40:47,398
<i>Could we put together a grilled</i>
<i>cheese sandwich? Muenster on rye. </i>

1571
01:40:47,474 --> 01:40:49,533
<i>Right away. </i>

1572
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:51,908
Oh, sorry. Where are my manners?
You guys want anything?

1573
01:40:51,979 --> 01:40:54,675
- No, thank you, sir.
- Shelly?

1574
01:40:54,748 --> 01:40:56,841
<i>Jesus, uh, Shell, </i>
<i>those were some... </i>

1575
01:40:56,917 --> 01:41:00,512
very nice things
you said aboutJack.

1576
01:41:02,489 --> 01:41:06,585
Jack, there. I understand
that you two have never met.

1577
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:09,390
<i>- Laine Hanson, Jack Hathaway. </i>
- It's a pleasure.

1578
01:41:09,463 --> 01:41:11,397
- I'm quite in awe of you.
- Thank you.

1579
01:41:13,467 --> 01:41:15,662
<i>[Glenda]</i>
<i>Mr. President? </i>

1580
01:41:15,736 --> 01:41:20,264
- Yes, Glenda?
<i>-Sir, the kitchen's</i>
<i>all out of Muenster. </i>

1581
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:24,538
Really? Wow.
Well, um, let's get on that.

1582
01:41:24,611 --> 01:41:28,012
<i>We don't want the wheels</i>
<i>coming off the wagon. </i>

1583
01:41:35,989 --> 01:41:39,686
This is, uh...

1584
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:44,527
This is quite an event.
Here we are. Quite a sad event.

1585
01:41:44,598 --> 01:41:46,589
- Mr. President, if I may?
- Yes, please.

1586
01:41:46,667 --> 01:41:50,467
A short while ago,
you told me that you thought
I might be the future of the party.

1587
01:41:50,537 --> 01:41:53,631
<i>I know that these</i>
<i>are tough times... </i>

1588
01:41:53,707 --> 01:41:55,641
and the future is uncertain...

1589
01:41:55,709 --> 01:41:59,406
but I'm very pleased to think
that I might be able to help
make things a little smoother.

1590
01:42:01,381 --> 01:42:05,909
The future, yes.
Well, there is one thing...

1591
01:42:05,986 --> 01:42:09,752
quite certain
about the future.

1592
01:42:11,325 --> 01:42:14,123
- What's that?
- [Coughs] Sir?

1593
01:42:14,194 --> 01:42:16,594
- You have the right to remain silent...
- Fred.

1594
01:42:16,663 --> 01:42:21,066
- I have to read him his rights.
- Fred, the governor,
he knows his rights.

1595
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:25,094
You know your rights, right, Jack?
You don't have to humiliate him.

1596
01:42:25,172 --> 01:42:27,640
You fucked up, buddy.

1597
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:32,008
<i>- The girl, do you know what she was? </i>
- What girl?

1598
01:42:32,079 --> 01:42:35,139
- The girl in the river.
- She was a paralegal.

1599
01:42:35,215 --> 01:42:38,651
- Before that.
- She was military. Fourteen Golf.

1600
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:43,179
<i>We found the money that you put</i>
<i>in her account at the Bellagio. </i>

1601
01:42:43,257 --> 01:42:46,420
- Two hundred thousand dollars.
- And that ad in...

1602
01:42:46,493 --> 01:42:48,927
- Soldier of Fortune.
<i>- Yeah, </i> Soldier of Fortune.

1603
01:42:48,996 --> 01:42:51,430
I don't mind confessing,
I am at a total fucking loss.

1604
01:42:51,498 --> 01:42:55,764
Shelly, he paid her
to go off the fucking bridge.

1605
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:59,203
<i>He paid her to save her. </i>

1606
01:42:59,273 --> 01:43:01,207
Jesus Christ.

1607
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:06,345
- Shelly, maybe l...
- You shouldn't say anything.

1608
01:43:06,413 --> 01:43:11,214
- Jack, look, we respect...
<i>- You're going to have</i>
<i>to come with me now. </i>

1609
01:43:11,285 --> 01:43:13,549
Fred. We respect you.

1610
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:16,612
We're trying to make this go
as smoothly as it possibly can.

1611
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:18,920
I know you meant no harm.

1612
01:43:18,992 --> 01:43:22,325
- Hell, I don't even know...
What would the charge be?
- Negligent homicide.

1613
01:43:22,396 --> 01:43:26,833
Oh, negligent homicide.

1614
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:28,891
Sir.

1615
01:43:30,404 --> 01:43:32,872
- Good luck, Mrs. Hanson.
- You too.

1616
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:36,205
Who doesn't want
a shortcut to greatness?

1617
01:43:51,158 --> 01:43:54,719
Oh, it's a goddamn shame
about the Muenster.

1618
01:44:05,439 --> 01:44:07,373
Mr. President.

1619
01:44:07,441 --> 01:44:09,705
<i>Yeah, Shelly? </i>

1620
01:44:09,776 --> 01:44:11,937
You set me up.

1621
01:44:12,012 --> 01:44:13,946
Just this once.

1622
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:20,451
For the record, sir...

1623
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:24,786
I find what you did
to be manipulative...

1624
01:44:24,858 --> 01:44:28,021
Mr. Chairman, let's just say...

1625
01:44:28,095 --> 01:44:31,258
"I'm guilty
but not responsible," hmm?

1626
01:44:32,633 --> 01:44:37,434
<i>Shelly, you needn't worry</i>
<i>about us exposing the fact... </i>

1627
01:44:37,504 --> 01:44:40,029
<i>that you leaked all that horrible</i>
<i>material about Laine on the Internet. </i>

1628
01:44:40,107 --> 01:44:44,976
We know that you were
just following your heart.

1629
01:44:46,013 --> 01:44:48,140
Yeah, Hartford,
it was a tough one.

1630
01:44:48,215 --> 01:44:50,376
But... Well, it doesn't
make a difference.

1631
01:44:50,450 --> 01:44:54,284
- She still is who she is.
- Yes, she is.

1632
01:44:54,354 --> 01:44:56,822
<i>And you are who you are. </i>

1633
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:01,418
You're still coming
to the banquet, aren't you?

1634
01:45:01,495 --> 01:45:04,328
Because I'd love to see you.
Is your wife in town?

1635
01:45:08,368 --> 01:45:11,462
May I introduce
tonight's honoree, Miss Barr?

1636
01:45:11,538 --> 01:45:14,405
- Congressman Webster.
- Honor, madam.

1637
01:45:14,474 --> 01:45:17,773
And, Congressman,
you know the senator, of course.

1638
01:45:17,844 --> 01:45:20,506
We go about two feet back.

1639
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:23,743
I asked them to have you seated
at my table tonight.

1640
01:45:23,817 --> 01:45:27,878
- If you want to break bread with me.
- Absolutely.

1641
01:45:27,954 --> 01:45:30,684
- Don't eat all the hors d'oeuvres.
- Shark steak sandwiches?

1642
01:45:30,757 --> 01:45:32,918
Yeah. Save me some.

1643
01:45:36,096 --> 01:45:40,294
Last time I shared one of these,
it was with the president of Russia.

1644
01:45:40,367 --> 01:45:45,566
Or maybe it was the kid
who won Wimbledon for the second time.

1645
01:45:45,639 --> 01:45:47,664
I'm honored, sir.

1646
01:45:47,741 --> 01:45:49,834
[Coughing]

1647
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:53,004
You're not supposed to inhale.

1648
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:56,345
Maybe that's the first thing
you should've told me.

1649
01:45:58,518 --> 01:46:01,248
Recognize this affidavit?

1650
01:46:01,321 --> 01:46:03,346
Where'd you get that, sir?

1651
01:46:03,423 --> 01:46:05,948
Where you got yours.

1652
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:08,859
Where Shelly Runyon got his.

1653
01:46:08,929 --> 01:46:11,591
From Mr. Webster.

1654
01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:15,426
He may not know
his right from his left...

1655
01:46:15,502 --> 01:46:18,528
but apparently
he does know right from wrong.

1656
01:46:20,006 --> 01:46:22,372
I understand you
even less now, Senator.

1657
01:46:22,442 --> 01:46:25,809
- You are an enigma wrapped in a riddle.
- Wrapped in a riddle.

1658
01:46:25,879 --> 01:46:29,144
Watch your step, Senator.

1659
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:37,722
What if I told you that I'm just
busting at the seams...

1660
01:46:37,791 --> 01:46:41,557
to know what exactly
happened that night...

1661
01:46:41,628 --> 01:46:45,257
to hear the truth
from your own lips?

1662
01:46:45,332 --> 01:46:48,563
Totally off the record.

1663
01:46:48,635 --> 01:46:54,130
Not between the president
and the senator, but between
the president and Laine.

1664
01:46:54,207 --> 01:46:57,938
Better than that.
Between Jackson and Laine.

1665
01:47:09,923 --> 01:47:14,383
Well, I had just turned 18
when I got to college...

1666
01:47:14,461 --> 01:47:17,555
and I had never been
away from home, not really.

1667
01:47:17,631 --> 01:47:23,263
And I was immediately...
I was immediately lonely.

1668
01:47:23,336 --> 01:47:26,999
And that's when
the sorority kicked in.

1669
01:47:27,073 --> 01:47:29,098
I wanted them,
they wanted me.

1670
01:47:29,176 --> 01:47:31,440
I was the daughter of the governor,
for chrissake.

1671
01:47:31,511 --> 01:47:34,810
- True blue catch.
- I guess so.

1672
01:47:34,881 --> 01:47:39,784
And like any other sorority,
they have an initiation, a rush.

1673
01:47:39,853 --> 01:47:45,120
And they have this girl, this woman
that Runyon deposed, Patty LaVamere.

1674
01:47:45,192 --> 01:47:47,490
She runs the sorority,
and she gives it to me straight:

1675
01:47:47,561 --> 01:47:53,466
If I wanna be in, I have to go to
their brother fraternity and have sex...

1676
01:47:53,533 --> 01:47:56,525
with two boys.

1677
01:47:56,603 --> 01:47:58,662
What a coup for them, huh?

1678
01:47:58,738 --> 01:48:02,401
Daughter of a big-time Republican
doing a frat house?

1679
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:05,445
But I say,
"There's no chance."

1680
01:48:05,512 --> 01:48:08,413
- The whole thing was pretty hairy.
- I bet.

1681
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:11,576
But six beers later,
I'm talking a different tune...

1682
01:48:11,651 --> 01:48:14,347
so off we go
to the frat house.

1683
01:48:14,421 --> 01:48:16,981
Half the girls were there,
about a zillion boys.

1684
01:48:17,057 --> 01:48:21,858
They're cheering my name.
"Laine! Laine! Laine!"

1685
01:48:21,928 --> 01:48:25,455
And I'm just stumbling around.

1686
01:48:27,634 --> 01:48:31,866
Eventually I just say,
"I'm gonna go for it."

1687
01:48:31,938 --> 01:48:36,466
If getting laid is a common initiation
for boys in the frat...

1688
01:48:36,543 --> 01:48:39,637
then why not for us, right?

1689
01:48:39,713 --> 01:48:43,843
- You're asking me?
- No, I'm not.

1690
01:48:43,917 --> 01:48:47,216
Oh, sorry.
Sorry. Go ahead.

1691
01:48:47,287 --> 01:48:49,551
That's okay.

1692
01:48:51,024 --> 01:48:53,584
So they send me
into this room.

1693
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:56,993
It's dark and dim.
There are these two guys.

1694
01:48:57,063 --> 01:49:00,624
They both have towels
wrapped around their waists.

1695
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:05,933
And the first guy,
he slips his towel off.

1696
01:49:06,006 --> 01:49:09,840
And I see his thing, and...

1697
01:49:09,910 --> 01:49:13,141
I take it in my hand...

1698
01:49:13,213 --> 01:49:16,239
and I say...

1699
01:49:17,918 --> 01:49:22,878
- It was the first thing
that came into my head.
- What did you say?

1700
01:49:22,956 --> 01:49:25,390
I said,
"I'm sorry, I don't smoke."

1701
01:49:25,458 --> 01:49:28,518
[Both Laughing]

1702
01:49:28,595 --> 01:49:31,792
And then I just got
the hell out of there.

1703
01:49:33,733 --> 01:49:35,667
You okay, sir?

1704
01:49:35,735 --> 01:49:40,968
Oh, no, I'm just thinking what I'd pay
to be back in college again.

1705
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:48,313
The next day, the campus
was rampant with word...

1706
01:49:48,381 --> 01:49:50,406
that I had been
the center of a gang-bang.

1707
01:49:50,483 --> 01:49:52,576
I mean, the governor's daughter.

1708
01:49:52,652 --> 01:49:55,917
Let me tell you.
That's one hell of a bell to un-ring.

1709
01:49:55,989 --> 01:49:58,753
- What about the photographs?
- Not me.

1710
01:49:58,825 --> 01:50:01,350
I never took my clothes off.

1711
01:50:01,428 --> 01:50:04,625
Even if I had, I've got
this big birthmark on my right thigh...

1712
01:50:04,698 --> 01:50:07,531
that the lady with the lovely physique
in the photo lacks.

1713
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:11,935
- No witnesses?
- Pure urban legend.

1714
01:50:12,005 --> 01:50:15,168
A little bit of wishful thinking
thrown in, I think.

1715
01:50:16,009 --> 01:50:18,671
You know, Laine...

1716
01:50:18,745 --> 01:50:23,079
you could've looked those pricks
in the eye and told them the truth.

1717
01:50:23,149 --> 01:50:25,640
Under oath. Told them
they were full of shit.

1718
01:50:25,719 --> 01:50:30,053
And barring that,
you could've at least told me.

1719
01:50:30,123 --> 01:50:35,060
But see, it really wasn't any of your
business either, and it still isn't.

1720
01:50:35,128 --> 01:50:38,620
There's something about
almost puking on a Havana...

1721
01:50:38,698 --> 01:50:41,064
that just turns a girl...
to blush.

1722
01:50:41,134 --> 01:50:45,468
This letter from Jack Bennet<i>... </i>

1723
01:50:45,538 --> 01:50:50,771
and Larry Bellows, affidavit, I guess,
that you got from Webster.

1724
01:50:50,844 --> 01:50:54,007
It pretty much says
that nothing happened that night.

1725
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:58,244
- They're ready
to come forward to be deposed.
- That's very good of them.

1726
01:50:58,318 --> 01:51:01,879
So, that's it. The end.
Good guys win.

1727
01:51:01,955 --> 01:51:05,254
I'm gonna call a press conference
tomorrow, read that letter...

1728
01:51:05,325 --> 01:51:09,989
and damn it if you don't have
the fastest confirmation on record.

1729
01:51:10,063 --> 01:51:11,997
No, sir.

1730
01:51:12,065 --> 01:51:14,659
"No, sir"?
What, "No, sir"?

1731
01:51:14,734 --> 01:51:19,433
I would prefer that we not
have the press conference, sir.

1732
01:51:19,506 --> 01:51:22,873
Laine, maybe you've been out
of law school too long.

1733
01:51:22,942 --> 01:51:26,105
- This is what they call
exculpatory evidence.
- Yes, I realize that.

1734
01:51:26,179 --> 01:51:30,081
- This is your ticket to wherever
history is gonna take you.
- Yes.

1735
01:51:30,150 --> 01:51:33,881
But principles only mean
something if you stick by them
when they're inconvenient.

1736
01:51:35,522 --> 01:51:38,389
If I ever did
answer the questions...

1737
01:51:38,458 --> 01:51:42,155
you know,
even to exonerate myself...

1738
01:51:42,228 --> 01:51:45,857
that would mean that it was
okay for them to have been
asked in the first place...

1739
01:51:45,932 --> 01:51:47,866
and it isn't.

1740
01:51:47,934 --> 01:51:50,664
- You would sacrifice your reputation?
- Yes, I would.

1741
01:51:50,737 --> 01:51:54,264
People have sacrificed
a lot more for a lot less.

1742
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:56,331
<i>[People Chattering]</i>

1743
01:51:56,409 --> 01:52:00,641
- We've got him! We have Goliath.
- Sir, are you all right, sir?

1744
01:52:00,714 --> 01:52:04,172
- It's okay, guys. Busted.
- POTUS is secure.

1745
01:52:04,517 --> 01:52:07,816
<i>[Radio Announcer]</i>
<i>Of course, the president addressing</i>
<i>a joint session of Congress... </i>

1746
01:52:07,887 --> 01:52:10,321
<i>is always unusual, </i>
<i>always an event. </i>

1747
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:13,291
<i>This speech is scheduled</i>
<i>to begin momentarily. </i>

1748
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:16,760
<i>We understand the president</i>
<i>has arrived at the U.S. Capitol. </i>

1749
01:52:16,830 --> 01:52:20,322
[Laine] I don't care if I never
see any of these guys again.

1750
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:24,837
<i>[Radio] Sources in the White House</i>
<i>have told us that the president... </i>

1751
01:52:24,904 --> 01:52:28,533
- It's gonna be okay.
<i>- Does intend to withdraw the name</i>
<i>of Senator Laine B. Hanson... </i>

1752
01:52:28,608 --> 01:52:33,511
I still have a year and a half on
my term. That's a long time to recover.

1753
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:39,041
- Then there's always...
<i>- Given the stunning charges</i>
<i>made against Governor Hathaway... </i>

1754
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:43,283
- Laine, honey, it's gonna be fine.
<i>- Those on the inside are suggesting... </i>

1755
01:52:43,356 --> 01:52:45,324
- It's gonna be okay.
<i>- The president will designate... </i>

1756
01:52:45,391 --> 01:52:48,656
<i>-Ambassador Francis J. Malloy</i>
<i>as his number two. </i>
- Yeah, thanks.

1757
01:52:50,063 --> 01:52:52,293
Pace me at five to ten, okay?

1758
01:52:55,535 --> 01:53:00,370
<i>[Radio Announcer]</i>
<i>... after the greeting</i>
<i>of the president of the United States. </i>

1759
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:04,274
<i>Mr. Speaker, the president</i>
<i>of the United States of America. </i>

1760
01:54:19,686 --> 01:54:22,154
<i>Thank you. </i>

1761
01:54:24,557 --> 01:54:29,893
Napoleon once said,
when asked to explain the lack
of great statesmen in the world...

1762
01:54:29,963 --> 01:54:32,454
that, "to get power...

1763
01:54:32,532 --> 01:54:36,024
you need to display
absolute pettiness.

1764
01:54:36,102 --> 01:54:40,198
To exercise power,
you need to show true greatness."

1765
01:54:40,273 --> 01:54:44,835
<i>Such pettiness and such greatness</i>
<i>are rarely found in one person. </i>

1766
01:54:44,911 --> 01:54:48,347
<i>I look upon the events</i>
<i>of the past weeks... </i>

1767
01:54:48,414 --> 01:54:52,214
<i>and I've never come so to grips</i>
<i>with that quotation. </i>

1768
01:54:52,285 --> 01:54:54,617
So, ladies and gentlemen
of this Congress...

1769
01:54:54,687 --> 01:55:00,091
it pains my soul to tell you
that you have brought blood
and shame under this great dome.

1770
01:55:00,159 --> 01:55:04,619
Your leadership has raised
the stakes of hate to a level...

1771
01:55:04,697 --> 01:55:09,259
where we can no longer separate
the demagogue from the truly inspired.

1772
01:55:09,335 --> 01:55:14,671
And believe this,
there are traitors among us.

1773
01:55:14,741 --> 01:55:19,337
<i>And I'm not talking about those of you</i>
<i>who sided against your party leadership. </i>

1774
01:55:19,412 --> 01:55:23,371
<i>I'm talking about those of you</i>
<i>who were patriots to your party... </i>

1775
01:55:23,449 --> 01:55:27,078
but traitors
to the necessary end result:

1776
01:55:27,153 --> 01:55:30,384
<i>that of righteousness, </i>
<i>the truth... </i>

1777
01:55:30,456 --> 01:55:35,792
the concept of making
the American dream blind to gender.

1778
01:55:35,862 --> 01:55:40,265
<i>And you know, </i>
<i>I am not free of blame. </i>

1779
01:55:40,333 --> 01:55:42,733
Right from the start
I should've come down here...

1780
01:55:42,802 --> 01:55:46,033
pointed a finger your way...

1781
01:55:46,105 --> 01:55:48,198
pointed a finger <i>your</i> way...

1782
01:55:48,274 --> 01:55:51,801
<i>and asked you, </i>
<i>"Have you no decency, sir?"</i>

1783
01:55:53,646 --> 01:55:56,740
<i>Yesterday... </i>

1784
01:55:56,816 --> 01:55:59,148
I met...

1785
01:55:59,218 --> 01:56:02,016
<i>Mr. Runyon... </i>

1786
01:56:02,088 --> 01:56:05,182
you may walk out on me,
you may walk out on this body...

1787
01:56:05,258 --> 01:56:10,093
but you cannot walk out
on the will of the American people.

1788
01:56:10,163 --> 01:56:13,155
<i>Americans are a good people, </i>
<i>they're a just people, Mr. Runyon... </i>

1789
01:56:13,232 --> 01:56:16,998
and they will forgive you,
but they will not forget.

1790
01:56:17,070 --> 01:56:19,698
Hate and ego
have no place residing...

1791
01:56:19,772 --> 01:56:24,436
in what my good friend Laine Hanson
calls the chapel of democracy.

1792
01:56:24,510 --> 01:56:26,410
<i>So, let me make one thing clear. </i>

1793
01:56:26,479 --> 01:56:31,007
<i>You come at us with whatever weapons</i>
<i>that you have in your arsenal... </i>

1794
01:56:31,084 --> 01:56:33,848
but there is
no weapon as powerful...

1795
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:37,481
as that of an idea
whose time has come.

1796
01:56:37,557 --> 01:56:41,653
A woman will serve in the highest level
of the Executive. Simple as that.

1797
01:56:41,728 --> 01:56:45,027
<i>Yesterday... </i>

1798
01:56:45,098 --> 01:56:48,659
I spoke with Laine Hanson.

1799
01:56:48,735 --> 01:56:52,068
I told her that she could decide
her own destiny.

1800
01:56:52,138 --> 01:56:55,107
If she wanted to continue
her fight for confirmation...

1801
01:56:55,174 --> 01:56:58,871
that I would stand beside her.

1802
01:56:58,945 --> 01:57:01,812
She has asked me
to allow her to step aside.

1803
01:57:01,881 --> 01:57:06,545
<i>She told me that she wanted</i>
<i>my administration to end on a note... </i>

1804
01:57:06,619 --> 01:57:10,316
of triumph
and not controversy.

1805
01:57:10,390 --> 01:57:15,919
Understand, those of you who worked
to bring Laine Hanson down...

1806
01:57:15,995 --> 01:57:19,624
that she asked to have her name
withdrawn from consideration...

1807
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:23,567
not because she isn't great,
but because she isn't petty.

1808
01:57:23,636 --> 01:57:27,231
<i>Because those two</i>
<i>conflicting leadership traits... </i>

1809
01:57:27,306 --> 01:57:31,037
<i>could not live as one</i>
<i>within her body or her soul. </i>

1810
01:57:31,110 --> 01:57:34,568
Greatness.
It comes in many forms.

1811
01:57:34,647 --> 01:57:38,549
Sometimes it comes in the form
of sacrifice. That's the loneliest form.

1812
01:57:38,618 --> 01:57:43,021
<i>Now, it turns out</i>
<i>that Laine Hanson is a woman... </i>

1813
01:57:43,089 --> 01:57:46,581
an American
of devout principle...

1814
01:57:46,659 --> 01:57:49,685
<i>and she has inspired me</i>
<i>to act alike... </i>

1815
01:57:49,762 --> 01:57:54,995
and I cannot accept
Senator Hanson's withdrawal.

1816
01:57:55,068 --> 01:58:00,335
<i>And I'm now calling for an immediate</i>
<i>vote of confirmation of Laine Hanson. </i>

1817
01:58:00,406 --> 01:58:02,374
And, Mr. Speaker...

1818
01:58:02,442 --> 01:58:06,936
I would like to make this
a live roll call.

1819
01:58:07,013 --> 01:58:09,811
I want to see the faces
of those of you...

1820
01:58:09,882 --> 01:58:13,045
who would eliminate the possibility
of greatness in American leadership...

1821
01:58:13,119 --> 01:58:17,351
because of half-truths,
lies and innuendoes.

1822
01:58:17,423 --> 01:58:20,449
I will not be deterred
by partisanship.

1823
01:58:20,526 --> 01:58:22,460
I will not be deterred
by misogyny.

1824
01:58:22,528 --> 01:58:25,019
<i>I will not be deterred</i>
<i>by hate. </i>

1825
01:58:25,098 --> 01:58:28,261
You have now come face-to-face
with my will.

1826
01:58:29,335 --> 01:58:32,600
<i>Confirm my nominee, </i>
<i>heal this nation... </i>

1827
01:58:32,672 --> 01:58:36,802
and let the American people
explode into this new millennium...

1828
01:58:36,876 --> 01:58:42,075
with the exhilaration of being true
to the glory of this democracy.

1829
01:58:42,148 --> 01:58:43,911
Thank you.

1830
01:59:29,862 --> 01:59:32,854
How's that for a swan song?

1831
01:59:32,932 --> 01:59:35,332
You're back, Laine.

1832
01:59:35,401 --> 01:59:38,427
Yeah, I know.

1833
