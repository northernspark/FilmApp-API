2
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,730
Idiots.

3
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,740
Take the captain beyond the reef
till we get permission to bring him ashore.

4
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,830
For a moment I thought
you were abandoning me.

5
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,830
Fernand Mondego does not
abandon his friends in the face of stupid, suicidal danger.

6
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,420
However, as Monsieur Morell's
official representative on this voyage, Edmond,

7
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,170
I must officially tell you
you have overstepped your bounds as second mate.

8
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,970
Officially. There.
I've covered myself.

9
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,720
If we don't get him to
a doctor, he will die. Do you understand?

10
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,720
Of course I understand.
Just don't expect me to do this sober.

11
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,720
- Right.

12
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,020
English dragoons.

13
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,690
Hello!

14
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,110
Dantes, don't.

15
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,160
- A little careless,
don't you think? - We have to talk to someone.

16
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,870
Well, I know, but--

17
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,200
We're French sailors!

18
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,660
- We seek medical attention!
- Come on. Come on.

19
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,040
- We come in peace.
- Come on.

20
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,790
We mean no harm!

21
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,800
Edmond!

22
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,720
Come on! Climb!

23
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,690
Look out!

24
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,180
Fernand!

25
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,930
Good. You finally
hit something.

26
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,060
Lieutenant Graypool.

27
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,820
If your thirst for gore demands
the death of these poor fools,

28
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,030
then by all means
shoot them.

29
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,070
But do so with the knowledge
they are no agents of mine.

30
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,280
Now explain yourselves
or be shot.

31
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,040
Sir, I am Edmond Dantes,

32
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,870
second mate of the merchant ship
Pharaon, on our way home to Marseilles.

33
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,880
This is the shipowner's representative,
Monsieur Fernand Mondego,

34
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,760
son of the Count Mondego.

35
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,760
Our captain has
contracted brain fever, so we put in here for help.

36
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,520
If his coma is genuine,
he won't feel my knife point, will he?

37
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,730
Only a scratch.

38
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,580
Edmond!

39
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,040
- Lieutenant Graypool!
- We came to you in good faith!

40
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,040
- That's for my wounded men.
- And wounded pride, no doubt.

41
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,800
It has been an eventful evening.

42
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,730
If I hadn't have shot those
dragoons, you might by lying in pieces on the beach right now.

43
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,610
- I almost got us killed.
- Yes,you did.

44
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,240
Yet... we survive.

45
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,620
Donne-moi encore
une bouteille du vin

46
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,620
- Whoo-hoo!

47
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,630
Donne-moi encore
une bouteille du vin

48
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,300
King's to you, Mondego.

49
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,050
Being your friend
is always an adventure.

50
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,640
- Yes, it is, isn't it?

51
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,890
It's a pity adventurers can't always
be friends though, huh?

52
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,390
What?

53
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,850
Well, it won't always
be like this, will it?

54
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,860
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Drink up.

55
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,110
We're drinking
Napoleon Bonaparte's wine.

56
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,070
 I think you'll find
the 1806 the finer vintage.

57
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,030
As long as you're still awake,
Monsieur Dantes, I wonder...

58
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,040
if I might have
a word with you.

59
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,750
I'm curious. What's the significance
of the chess piece?

60
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,210
It's just something
we've done since childhood.

61
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,220
Whenever one of us has had a victory,
king of the moment.

62
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,930
- King of the moment?
- Yes.

63
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,930
 In life, we're all
either kings or pawns.

64
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,900
I'm moved by your effort to save
your captain's life, Dantes.

65
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,860
He is my captain...
and my friend, Your Majesty.

66
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,240
Loyal friends
are rare indeed.

67
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,950
In fact, it is upon such
a matter I wish to speak.

68
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,950
I have written a rather
sentimental letter to an old comrade in Marseilles.

69
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,870
It's a side of me I prefer
the British not see.

70
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,960
Since they have a habit
of opening my mail,

71
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,840
I wonder if you would
deliver it for me.

72
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,050
Oh, l-I don't--

73
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,050
It's just a letter
from one old soldier to another.

74
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,010
It's totally innocent,
I assure you.

75
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:16,010
But more important,
it is the price I demand for the use of my physician.

76
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,400
Then I agree.

77
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Good.

78
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,820
You are to deliver the letter
to Monsieur Clarion.

79
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,780
- Can you remember that name?
- Monsieur Clarion. How will I find him?

80
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,070
Oh, he will find you.

81
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,950
Now, I do not wish
this letter's existence to be known to anyone else.

82
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,250
Not even your boon companion back there.
Do you understand?

83
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,750
I'm a man of my word,
Your Majesty.

84
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,750
Yes, l, uh--
I believe you are.

85
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,900
What did he want?

86
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,900
Oh, um, news from France.
That's all.

87
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,430
Time you were on your way.
Your captain has been dead for half an hour.

88
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,520
Are you sure?

89
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,270
When you have walked
as many battlefields as l, young Dantes,

90
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:47,270
you can feel death.

91
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,450
Kings and pawns, Marchand.

92
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,450
Emperors... and fools.

93
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,140
Come about!

94
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,020
Drive faster.

95
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,450
Danglars, what's happened?

96
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,000
Captain Reynaud is dead, sir,

97
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,420
and Edmond Dantes
disobeyed my orders.

98
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,420
Come to my office
and report, Danglars.

99
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,300
- And you, Edmond.
- Will you be needing me, Monsieur Morell?

100
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,260
Go.

101
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,350
Mercedes.

102
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,350
- Where is he? Where is Edmond?
- How lovely to see you too.

103
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,570
You just missed him,
I'm afraid.

104
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,320
Could be a while.
I think he's in trouble.

105
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,360
He said he'd meet us
by the rock. Come on.

106
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,490
I told Dantes
not to go ashore.

107
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,910
Is this true?

108
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,330
I accept
all responsibility.

109
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,910
As well you should.
It was all his idea, monsieur.

110
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,630
It should have
been your idea.

111
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,210
Puttin' into Elba didn't save
the captain's life, monsieur.

112
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,380
- I was protectin'the merchandise.
- You were protecting yourself...

113
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,300
by hiding behind your rank
and staying aboard.

114
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,310
Edmond Dantes, I am making you
the new captain of the Pharaon.

115
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,150
You presume to demote me?

116
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,150
There is no demotion.

117
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:59,150
You will remain first mate
under Captain Dantes.

118
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,280
Unless, of course, you choose
to seek another berth.

119
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,380
Now I imagine there's
a certain young lady...

120
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,380
who will want
to hear this news.

121
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,680
- Thank you.

122
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,570
Monsieur Morell?

123
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,530
- I understand you had a ship just
returned from Elba, monsieur. - Yes.

124
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,120
Did anyone aboard
get ashore there by any chance?

125
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,960
They did, but they're
not here at the moment.

126
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,670
Thank you, monsieur.

127
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,420
- May I say who has called upon them?
- Clarion.

128
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,420
The name is Clarion.

129
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,770
- Make love to me.
- Will you ever give up?

130
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,440
- He doesn't have to know.
- I'd know.

131
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,770
So would I.

132
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,690
- It'd be our little secret.
- I don't believe in secrets.

133
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,700
You think Edmond doesn't have secrets?
He does. Ask him.

134
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,070
- I know what you want, Fernand.
- You do?

135
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,080
Remember when we were kids and
Edmond got that whistle for his birthday, and you got a pony?

136
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,630
You were so mad Edmond
was happier with his whistle than you were with your pony.

137
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,630
I'm not going to be
your next whistle.

138
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,380
How long do you think
it's going to be before he can afford a wife?

139
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,390
Two years.
Two years. That's all.

140
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,560
Then he gets his captain's
papers, and we can marry.

141
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,560
Two years. I couldn't wait
two years for anything,

142
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,530
particularly
a bride like you.

143
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,150
Hey!

144
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,360
- There he is.
- Hey!

145
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,370
- Whoo!
- Mercedes!

146
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,830
I missed you so.

147
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,330
The missing is over now.

148
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:21,340
- Are you in trouble?
- No. I'm captain. Come on.

149
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,640
Monsieur Morell
gave me the Pharaon.

150
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,350
Edmond!

151
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,520
King's to me.

152
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,480
 Yours is a life
truly blessed, Edmond.

153
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,320
Come on.

154
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,530
- You're still the best man.
- I know.

155
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:52,490
Come on!

156
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,110
Stop that.
You'll go bald.

157
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,620
Do you keep secrets from me?

158
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,620
Secrets? No.

159
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,710
Why?

160
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,260
Ask me anything
and I'll tell you.

161
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,720
We don't have to wait
two years anymore.

162
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,720
- As soon as I can afford
the ring, we'll wed-- - I don't need a ring. I don't.

163
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,900
This will be my ring.

164
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,910
And no matter what happens,

165
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,950
you will never see it
off my finger.

166
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:18,460
Ever.

167
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,590
Hello, my fine young gentleman.

168
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Care to join me?

169
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,810
So tell me, Mondego,

170
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,980
how did you ever
become friends...

171
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,990
with that righteous little ponce,
Edmond Dantes?

172
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,490
He claims to be my friend,

173
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,000
yet he has the audacity
to keep secrets from me.

174
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,960
What secrets?

175
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,690
To the new captain
of the Pharaon.

176
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,480
All I am I owe
to you, Father.

177
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,700
May this happy moment
be but the dawn...

178
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,700
of a long and wonderful life
for you both.

179
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,670
- Which of you is Edmond Dantes?
- I am.

180
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,590
Edmond Dantes,
you are under arrest by order of the magistrate of Marseilles.

181
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,880
- Arrest?
- On what charges?

182
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,720
That information is
privileged. Take him.

183
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,720
I demand an explanation.
I demand an explanation!

184
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,350
I'll be back tonight.
Don't worry, Father. This is a mistake.

185
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Mon Dieu.

186
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,080
Well, I must say, Dantes,
you don't have the look of a traitor.

187
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,410
Traitor?

188
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,920
Now, attend me well, Dantes,
for your life may depend on it.

189
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,590
Did you have any personal
contact with Napoleon when you were on Elba?

190
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,880
Elba, yes, I did.
Well, we did.

191
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,880
I was with the
Count Mondego's son, Fernand, almost the entire time.

192
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,100
- Do you know Fernand?
- He's a recent acquaintance, yes.

193
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,060
Oh, there you are.
He'll vouch for me.

194
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,400
No doubt, but you said,
``almost the entire time."

195
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,690
Except for when Napoleon asked
me to deliver a personal letter to a friend in Marseilles.

196
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:59,070
Well, Dantes, it is for
accepting that treasonous correspondence...

197
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,120
that you have been denounced
by your own first mate, a Monsieur Danglars.

198
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,960
- What?
- Did you deliver the letter?

199
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,790
No, sir, someone was
supposed to find me.

200
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,750
It's-- It's still
in my jacket. Here.

201
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,940
- Have you read this?
- No, sir, I can't read.

202
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,450
Well, Dantes,
this is a letter to one of Napoleon's agents.

203
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,450
It gives the times and
the locations of the British beach patrols on Elba.

204
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,960
Sir, I swear on my mother's
grave, I had no idea.

205
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,960
He swore its contents
were innocent.

206
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,970
No, it's you
that's innocent.

207
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,850
Foolish and innocent.

208
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,600
I believe these are
the worst charges that could be leveled against you.

209
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,610
Fortunately, as I've
intercepted this document, there's no harm done.

210
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,700
God knows how
you're going to survive in this world, Edmond Dantes.

211
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,700
But you are no traitor.

212
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,660
You may go.

213
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,710
Thank you, sir.

214
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Wait, uh, did Napoleon
tell you who's supposed to pick up the letter?

215
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,800
Monsieur Clarion.

216
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,800
What name did you say?

217
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:46,220
Monsieur Clarion.

218
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,640
Have you mentioned
this name to anyone else?

219
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,890
Monsieur Mondego
or anyone?

220
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,860
No, sir, in fact,
Monsieur Mondego knows nothing of this letter.

221
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:05,030
This is very
dangerous information.

222
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,080
One can never be too careful
in times like this.

223
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,210
- Don't you think?
- Yes, sir.

224
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,750
Mm-hmm.

225
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,260
I've given you rather
a stressful time.

226
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,130
I wonder if, by way of an
apology, I could offer you my carriage home.

227
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:26,140
- It's just through here.

228
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,060
Thank you.

229
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:55,210
Monsieur Villefort?
Monsieur Villefort?

230
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,210
Monsieur Villefort!

231
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,990
Whoa. Whoa!

232
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:28,830
Where are you taking me?

233
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,160
This is a mistake.

234
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,000
- I'm allowed to go home.
- From now on, your home is the prison Chateau d'lf.

235
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
- No! No! No!

236
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,010
- Hey!

237
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,350
Shoot him now!

238
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,350
Mount up!
Get after him!

239
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:14,040
Fernand! Fernand!

240
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,830
- Monsieur?
- It's all right. He's right here. Fernand!

241
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,750
I've been arrested for treason.
I barely managed to escape.

242
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,380
When we were on Elba,
Napoleon gave me a letter.

243
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,090
I didn't tell you because
he made me promise not to.

244
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,090
He said it was just
some note to an old friend.

245
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,760
But the bastard lied to me!
He lied.

246
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,310
It was to one of his agents.

247
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:37,270
Somehow the authorities found out.
I don't know what to do.

248
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,350
There's gendarmes on
horseback right behind me.

249
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,730
All right.
We just have to think.

250
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,740
I hope I haven't
compromised you.

251
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,780
I was hoping your father
could help me.

252
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,070
He's in Paris.
He's very ill.

253
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,120
- How far back are the gendarmes?
- Minutes.

254
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,830
- Do you need money?
- Yes, thank you.

255
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,370
- Do you have a pistol?
- Of course not.

256
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,630
Good.

257
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:03,630
Stop it, Fernand.
I don't have time for this.

258
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,890
I saw Napoleon
give you that letter.

259
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,760
It was you?

260
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,430
Well, it wasn't just me.
It was Danglars's idea.

261
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,890
Why didn't you
come to me first?

262
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,650
Why did you keep it a secret from me?
I thought you were my friend.

263
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,820
I told you I gave Napoleon my word.
He lied to me!

264
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,820
I know, Edmond.
I read the letter.

265
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:37,410
You-- You read--

266
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,710
Why are you doing this?

267
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,710
Oh, it's complicated.

268
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,180
Complicated.

269
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,470
Don't be ridiculous.

270
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,430
- Get out of my way.
- I can't let you go, Edmond.

271
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,790
Get away from the window.

272
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,830
Don't make me
take off your hand!

273
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,820
Why? In God's name, why?

274
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:58,740
- Because you're the son of a clerk!

275
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,040
And I'm not supposed
to want to be you.

276
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,960
- In here!
- In here!

277
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,840
- Get!
- Wait.

278
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,850
- Hold it. Hold it.

279
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:27,360
To remember better days.

280
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,190
Come on!

281
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:36,490
I told you it wasn't always
going to be this way, Edmond.

282
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:51,130
Father! Where is he?

283
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:54,170
The study.
What's he done now?

284
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:58,180
Now,you listen to me, Father.
I am the chief magistrate, an official of the new regime.

285
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:02,430
I cannot afford to have
my own father mixed up in treasonous affairs!

286
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,440
You know--

287
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,400
In the end, treason
is a matter of dates.

288
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:16,240
I shall be the patriot,
and you the traitor, when the emperor returns.

289
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,580
Stop it. Stop it,
you old ruin.

290
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,580
Those days are over.
Napoleon Bonaparte is no longer the emperor of anything.

291
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,830
If you continue
to dabble in this lunacy, you run an excellent chance...

292
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,250
of being arrested and ruining
our entire family all because of your idiotic sympathies.

293
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,090
At least I have sympathies.

294
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,300
For God's sake, Father,
all Valentina is saying...

295
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,050
is that as a family
our fates are intertwined.

296
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:43,060
- Surely you can see that.
- See? Ah!

297
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,020
I'm an old ruin.

298
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,020
I don't see as well as I did.
You will excuse me.

299
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,990
- Move it.

300
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:52,380
Move.

301
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,590
Welcome, Monsieur Dantes.

302
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:04,140
I am Armand Dorleac,
the warden of Chateau d'lf.

303
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,140
Monsieur, I know you must
hear this a great deal,

304
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:13,270
- but I assure you I am innocent.

305
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,530
Everyone must say that,
I know, but I truly am.

306
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,360
- Innocent.
- Yes.

307
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,370
I know. I really do know.

308
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:27,540
- You mock me?
- No, my dear Dantes.

309
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I know perfectly well
that you are innocent. Why else would you be here?

310
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,750
- If you were truly guilty,

311
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,760
there are a hundred prisons in France
where they would lock you away,

312
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:45,430
but Chateau d'lf is where they
put the ones they're ashamed of.

313
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:54,350
Let's have a look at
your quarters now, shall we?

314
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:13,420
"God will give me justice."

315
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:17,380
People are always trying
to motivate themselves.

316
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,380
Or they keep calendars,
but soon they lose interest or they die.

317
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:26,550
- There's a window.
-All I'm left with is a rather unsightly wall, I'm afraid.

318
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,640
So I conceived of another way to help
our prisoners keep track of time.

319
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:34,310
Every year, on the anniversary
of their imprisonment,

320
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,480
we hurt them.

321
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,230
Usually just
a simple beating really.

322
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:43,240
Although, on their first day here,
in your case, today,

323
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,620
I like to do
something rather special.

324
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,080
And if you're
thinking just now,

325
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,750
``Why me, O God?"

326
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,750
- the answer is,
God has nothing to do with it. - All right?

327
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:04,220
In fact, God is never
in France this time of year.

328
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,220
God has everything to do with it.
He's everywhere. He sees everything.

329
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,690
All right.

330
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,310
Let's make a bargain,
shall we?

331
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:21,320
You ask God for help,
and I'll stop the moment he shows up.

332
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,300
Monsieur Villefort,
have you not heard?

333
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,460
- Napoleon has escaped from Elba!
- What?

334
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,470
Landed 100 miles from here.
He marches on Paris!

335
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,680
Pack all my files.
And tell that idiot clerk to find the ledger!

336
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,650
We are here to plead the case
of Edmond Dantes, Magistrate.

337
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,730
Not now! Dantes?

338
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:05,740
We have not met, monsieur.
I am Fernand Mondego, the son of Count Mondego.

339
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,490
I am here to swear
to Edmond Dantes's innocence.

340
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:14,490
This is his employer,
Monsieur Morell, his father, and his fiancee, Mercedes.

341
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,590
Edmond Dantes is charged
with high treason.

342
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:26,550
- Yet you stand by him?
- Of course I do.

343
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,760
What if I was to tell you
that Dantes is also charged with murder?

344
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,930
- Murder?
- Edmond would never do such a thing.

345
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,940
Dantes carried a letter from
Napoleon to one of his agents.

346
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,940
When we tried to arrest him,
he killed one of my men.

347
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,780
No, if you knew him,
monsieur, you would know that was not possible.

348
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,780
Have mercy, please.

349
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,450
You have proof
of this treason?

350
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,450
That is government business.

351
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:55,450
Please. Please,
just tell us where he is.

352
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,710
I cannot, mademoiselle.
He was handed over to the king's men.

353
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,960
I can understand your pain
at this betrayal.

354
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,920
But my advice to all of you
would be to forget Edmond Dantes,

355
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,300
particularly you,
mademoiselle.

356
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,970
Take solace in the comfort
of your good friend here...

357
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:16,930
and perhaps some good may yet come
of this unhappy affair.

358
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:21,230
Now, you will excuse me.
I have to attend some other matters.

359
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,560
My son is no traitor!

360
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,730
I will try to reason with him.

361
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:28,240
- Let's leave this to Fernand.
He can plead the case. - It's impossible. Never.

362
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,740
I will not give up
on Edmond yet.

363
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,570
I will never
forget your kindness.

364
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:37,580
And I shall never
cease to give it.

365
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,460
Not that I don't appreciate
the embroidery of the crimes,

366
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,010
but still, murder?

367
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,970
It's quite simple really.

368
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,340
When you reported Dantes's
receiving the letter to me,

369
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,720
I didn't quite understand
why you were betraying him,

370
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,730
but now having seen
his exquisite fiancee, I understand completely.

371
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:06,320
What prompts you to be
so accommodating?

372
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:10,740
Sit down, Mondego.

373
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,540
Come back!

374
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,580
Come back!

375
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,590
What's my crime?
What's my crime?

376
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,960
I'm innocent!

377
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,930
Happy anniversary, Dantes.

378
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:07,900
Until next year.

379
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,180
 Has it really been
four years, Delius?

380
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,850
- Or Danton? What is his name again?

381
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:50,520
Forgive my intrusion.

382
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,310
But I was under
the impression that l--

383
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:58,320
I was digging
toward the outer wall.

384
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,610
Parlez-vous anglais?

385
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:08,080
Italiano?

386
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:12,080
I am Abbe Faria. I have been a prisoner
in Chateau d'lf for 11 years.

387
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,670
Five which
have been spent...

388
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:20,300
digging this tunnel.

389
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,720
There are 72,519 stones...

390
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,180
in my walls.

391
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:37,190
I've counted them many times.

392
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,360
But have you
named them yet?

393
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,740
-Shh, shh.

394
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:48,030
Shh, shh.

395
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,160
Once I was as you are now.

396
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,120
But I promise, it will pass.

397
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,580
I promise, I promise.

398
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,590
Now, may I stand
on your shoulders?

399
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,180
Take me down.

400
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,140
Please, take me down now.
Take me down.

401
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:25,690
I have not seen the sky
these 11 years. Thank you.

402
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,280
Thank you, God.

403
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,080
There is no talk of God
in here, priest.

404
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,910
What about
the... inscription?

405
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:40,920
It's faded, just as God
has faded from my heart.

406
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,630
-And what has replaced it?
- Revenge.

407
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,260
Hold these.

408
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,640
Follow me.

409
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,810
Perhaps your thoughts
of revenge...

410
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:00,020
are serving God's purpose
of keeping you alive...

411
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,360
these seven years.

412
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,360
- To what end?
- Escape.

413
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,710
There we go.

414
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:52,870
You spoke of escape.

415
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,080
Yeah.

416
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,330
There are only two possibilities
of reaching the outer wall...

417
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,830
and finally the sea.

418
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:04,790
I simply--
I simply chose the wrong one.

419
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:08,170
Now, of course,
with two of us,

420
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:11,010
we could dig in
the opposite direction.

421
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,970
With both of us together, then,
of course, we could possibly do it in, oh, eight years.

422
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,810
Oh, does something else
demand your time?

423
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:28,780
Some pressing appointment,
perhaps?

424
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:33,490
In return... for your help,

425
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,910
I offer something priceless.

426
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,530
My freedom?

427
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:40,370
No, freedom
can be taken away,

428
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,170
as you well know.

429
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:47,170
I offer knowledge,
everything I have learned.

430
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,170
I will teach you, oh,
economics, mathematics,

431
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:55,180
-philosophy, science.
- To read and write?

432
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:00,180
Of course.

433
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,060
When do we start?

434
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,230
I got it. I got it.

435
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:13,240
Lights out. Lights.

436
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,910
Let's have 'em. Come on.

437
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:18,080
The slot opens twice a day.

438
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,040
Once for your toilet bucket,
which is where we hide the dirt.

439
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:28,130
Come on.

440
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:32,130
And once in the evening
for your plate.

441
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,930
Lights out. Out.

442
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:39,050
Come on, priest.

443
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,220
Thank you.

444
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,430
Between those times we can work all day
without fear of discovery.

445
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:48,110
"So neglect becomes...

446
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:50,520
our ally."

447
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,530
Excellent.

448
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,280
So you were in
Napoleon's army.

449
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,450
We had such dreams then.

450
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:05,410
However, one night...

451
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:09,000
my regiment ran down...

452
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,170
a band of guerrillas,

453
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:14,460
who ran into a church
for sanctuary.

454
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,470
I was ordered to burn...
down the church...

455
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:23,310
with them inside it.

456
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:27,270
Did you?

457
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,480
To my everlasting shame, I did.

458
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,480
I did.

459
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,570
How did you come to be here?

460
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:39,990
The following day
I deserted...

461
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:42,870
to devote my life
to repentance...

462
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,040
and to God.

463
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,660
I worked as
private secretary to...

464
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:51,670
the enormously wealthy
Count Enrique Spada.

465
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:56,470
Spada was
a righteous man.

466
00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:00,430
Sadly, a couple
of years later, he died...

467
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:05,390
amidst rumors that he had
hidden his limitless fortune.

468
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,020
- Two weeks later, I was arrested.
- Why?

469
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:17,030
Napoleon wanted
Spada's treasure.

470
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:21,030
He did not believe that
I had no idea where it was.

471
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:25,950
So he had me thrown in here
to refresh my memory.

472
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,120
And so here I've remained
with only God...

473
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:35,130
for company
until he sent me you.

474
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,550
God is no more real
than your treasure, priest.

475
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:41,550
Perhaps.

476
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:55,070
- Ooh! Hurry. Get it.

477
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:01,570
Compute this.

478
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:05,410
2,500 cubic centimeters
of rock and dust a day...

479
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:09,410
for 365 days.

480
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,750
Equals three-and-a-half
meters a year,

481
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:15,420
12 feet, a foot a month.

482
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,760
Three inches a week.

483
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,010
In Italian.

484
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:34,520
Do not waste the light.

485
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,360
You were a soldier, priest.

486
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,030
So you know weaponry.

487
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:54,710
Teach me.

488
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:59,250
Or dig alone.

489
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,260
You force me to walk
a fine line, Dantes.

490
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:17,060
This is ridiculous.

491
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:21,070
The stronger swordsman
does not necessarily win.

492
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,570
It is speed!

493
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:28,200
Speed of hand.

494
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,490
Speed of mind.

495
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:34,460
Now, sweep your hand
through the drops...

496
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:38,840
without getting wet.

497
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,840
Like this.

498
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:50,100
How long must I keep this up?

499
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,690
I am going down the tunnel.

500
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,290
Parry. Up.

501
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:13,870
Like that.

502
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:17,710
Time to study.

503
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,710
Define economics.

504
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:22,300
Economics is the science
that deals with the production,

505
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,460
distribution and
consumption of commodities.

506
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:27,470
Translation.

507
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:31,470
Dig first, money later.

508
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:50,410
Thank you.
Happy Christmas, Edmond.

509
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:54,370
Give or take a month or so.

510
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:00,750
Good. Whom are you fighting?
Danglars? Mondego?

511
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:04,710
Who do you think?

512
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:13,930
Good! Too good.

513
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:16,810
We have Newton's third law.

514
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:20,810
There is a reaction
to every action...

515
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:23,730
in physics... and in man.

516
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:27,690
Thus my quest for vengeance
is a reaction to the actions of Danglars and Mondego.

517
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:32,200
Up, up.

518
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,290
I want that seat.

519
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:39,250
You once told me that Villefort
had you rearrested just after...

520
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:43,920
he had cleared you
of all the charges.

521
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,710
You may go.

522
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:48,470
Yes, that's true.

523
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:52,430
Then why would he go
through that charade...

524
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,720
unless he had reason to change his mind
about letting you go?

525
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:01,480
- Think, Edmond.
- I'm trying.

526
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,610
- What happened?
- He asked me--

527
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:06,780
Did Napoleon tell you
who was supposed to pick up this letter?

528
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,990
- I told him--
- A Monsieur Clarion.

529
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:12,950
-And nothing more?
- Nothing. He burnt the letter and said I could go.

530
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,450
Ah.

531
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:19,410
He burned... the letter.

532
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,210
Yes.

533
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:30,800
Strange that a chief magistrate
would burn evidence...

534
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,760
of a treasonous conspiracy...

535
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,760
and then imprison
the only man...

536
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:42,810
who was aware of
Monsieur Clarion's connection...

537
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:47,020
to that conspiracy.

538
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,860
- He was protecting someone.
-Ah.

539
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:56,830
-A dear friend perhaps?
- No. No.

540
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,450
A politician like Villefort
would have rid himself of such friends.

541
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,040
Clarion could be a relative.

542
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,040
A close relative, possibly--

543
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:13,510
No!

544
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:17,390
Villefort's father was
a colonel in Napoleon's army.

545
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:20,270
Villefort wasn't
protecting Clarion.

546
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:23,640
He was protecting himself.

547
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,650
Danglars, who falsely said he saw
Napoleon give me that letter.

548
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:30,730
Mondego, who told
Villefort I had it.

549
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:34,700
And Villefort himself,
who sent me here.

550
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,660
Bravo, Edmond, bravo.

551
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:23,910
Oh, my God. Oh, oh.

552
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:26,790
Oh.

553
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:30,420
Edmond, light. Light.
Quick. Light.

554
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,550
Oh, please, God.
What is that? Look.

555
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:37,550
Look. Look!
Roots. Plant roots.

556
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:41,890
If these are plant roots,
then we are only months away.

557
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:46,350
Yes. Well done, priest.
I'll get my chisel.

558
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:49,980
Good. Good.

559
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:03,490
Priest!

560
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,470
In God's name, go on.

561
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:24,680
- Go on. Go on!

562
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:52,080
Lungs...
are punctured.

563
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,090
- Don't talk. Don't talk.
- Listen.

564
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:57,590
There's not much time.

565
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:59,880
Under th-those books,

566
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,890
there's loose rocks.

567
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:04,100
Bring me what you find.

568
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,100
Quickly, quickly.

569
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,060
Open it.

570
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,650
When I told them
I did not know...

571
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:16,650
where the treasure
of Spada was, I lied.

572
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:18,900
You lied?

573
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:22,070
I'm a priest,
not a saint.

574
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:24,070
There,

575
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:26,740
on that island
off the Italian coast.

576
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,910
- Monte Cristo?
- Yes, yes.

577
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:32,750
Use-- Use your head.

578
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:36,090
- Follow the clues.
- The tunnel's blocked. I can't escape.

579
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:38,090
No, keep digging.

580
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:41,760
When you escape, use it for good,
only for good.

581
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,720
No, I will surely
use it for my revenge.

582
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:49,220
Here now
is your final lesson.

583
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:52,940
Do not commit--

584
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:56,110
Oh. Do not commit
the crime...

585
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:59,860
for which you now
serve the sentence.

586
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,240
God said,
``Vengeance is mine."

587
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,240
I don't believe in God.

588
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,120
That doesn't matter.

589
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:11,080
He believes in you.

590
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:20,130
Priest?

591
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:30,850
Plates out.

592
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:42,650
Let's have it.

593
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,330
Oh.

594
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:51,950
Oh, God.

595
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:04,800
- He's always awake.

596
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:20,940
First time in 12 years
he hasn't said ``thank you."

597
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,240
- Dead.
- How?

598
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,240
Fell off his bed,
didn't he?

599
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:33,080
- He's a bit dirty, isn't he?
- They all are.

600
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,080
Well,
let's sew him up...

601
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:40,090
and then see Dorleac.

602
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:47,300
One, two, three.

603
00:55:56,390 --> 00:56:00,400
Right, let's get Dorleac.

604
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,400
- Why'd you lock it?
He's not going anywhere.

605
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,370
I don't know. Habit, I suppose.

606
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,180
Good-bye, priest.

607
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:33,930
You're free now,

608
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:36,350
as I will never be.

609
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:02,040
So the old pope has finally gone
to St. Peter's.

610
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:05,050
Well, bring him along.

611
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:07,260
- Let's bury him, then.
- You ready?

612
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:11,220
One. That's it.

613
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:18,060
- Keep going.
- Come on, come on. I haven't got all day.

614
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:23,060
Actually, I do.

615
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:26,320
I've got--

616
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:30,320
I've got all the time
in the world!

617
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:49,090
Come on.

618
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,180
Come on.

619
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:07,320
Monsieur Dorleac!

620
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,860
 Heavenly Father,
we bequeath to you...

621
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:14,820
these remains
of your humble servant.

622
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,910
Whatever his name was.

623
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:19,910
God, I'm so bored.

624
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:23,920
Monsieur Dorleac!

625
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,550
Did he, in fact,
have a map?

626
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:35,930
No, gov.

627
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:39,930
Where's the, uh--

628
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,890
Stop!

629
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:44,900
Monsieur Dorleac!

630
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,310
What do you mean, after three?
We throw him at three or before three?

631
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:50,940
- After three.
- One... two...

632
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,860
- Monsieur Dorleac!
- and th--

633
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,990
- Don't, Mr. Dorleac!
- One...

634
00:58:56,990 --> 00:59:00,580
- two...
- Don't throw the body over the cliff!.

635
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:04,580
- Aah!
- three!

636
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:43,100
We could have handled that
a bit better.

637
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,670
Thank you, priest.

638
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:20,630
Thank you.

639
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,460
So, mi amice,

640
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:59,050
I would ask who you are,
but in view of your shredded clothes...

641
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:02,380
and the fact that
the Chateau d'lf is two miles away,

642
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:04,300
what's the point?

643
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:08,310
As for me, I am Luigi Vampa,
a smuggler and a thief.

644
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:12,520
My men and I have come
to this island to bury alive one of our number...

645
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,440
who attempted to keep
some stolen gold for himself...

646
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,650
instead of, uh, sharing it
with his comrades.

647
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:21,280
Interestingly enough, there are some
of his more loyal friends...

648
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,410
who are insisting
that I grant him mercy,

649
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,450
which, of course,
I cannot do,

650
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:29,080
for I would quickly lose control
of the whole crew.

651
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:33,040
- That's why you are
such a fortunate find. - Why is that?

652
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:37,000
You provide me with a way
to show a little mercy to Jacopo,

653
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,340
that maggot you see
tied up over there,

654
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:42,510
while, at the same time,
not appearing weak.

655
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:46,350
And as a special treat,
the lads will get to see a little sport as well.

656
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:48,470
How do I accomplish
all this?

657
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:51,810
We watch you and Jacopo
fight to the death.

658
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:54,730
If Jacopo wins,
we welcome him back to the crew.

659
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:57,770
If you win, I have given Jacopo
the chance to live,

660
01:02:57,770 --> 01:03:00,780
even if he did not
take advantage of it,

661
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:03,740
and you can take his place
on the boat.

662
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:06,370
What if I win,
and I don't want to be a smuggler?

663
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:10,370
Then we slit your throat,
and we're a bit shorthanded.

664
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:13,660
I find that smuggling
is the life for me...

665
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:16,500
and would be delighted
to kill your friend, the maggot.

666
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:20,460
Oh, uh, by the way,
Jacopo is the best knife fighter I've ever seen.

667
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:26,300
Perhaps you should
get out more.

668
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,100
Release Jacopo
and give him back his knife.

669
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,140
Then we let
the games begin.

670
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:37,100
- Get up, maggot.

671
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:49,160
- Come on, come on!

672
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:09,470
As you hope to live,
do not move an eyelash.

673
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:13,720
Senor Vampa,
allow Jacopo to live.

674
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,730
He's already suffered enough
with the prospect of being buried alive.

675
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:20,900
The men that wanted
to see some sport have seen it.

676
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:24,230
Those who wanted mercy
for Jacopo will get it.

677
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:26,740
And by keeping me
and Jacopo,

678
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:30,740
you will have yet another skilled sailor
and fighter for your crew.

679
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:37,160
It's a deal.

680
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,580
- What is his name?
- You've got the devil,Jacopo!

681
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:43,590
His name?
We shall call him Zatarra.

682
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:47,670
- Sounds fearsome.
- It means driftwood.

683
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:52,430
I swear
on my dead relatives,

684
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:55,770
even on the ones
that are not feeling too good,

685
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:59,600
I am your man forever.

686
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:03,570
I know.

687
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:27,760
Eyes in the back of your head.

688
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:34,970
Have you never seen
Marseilles before?

689
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:37,310
It was my home.

690
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:40,810
But you do not join
the others ashore.

691
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:44,650
- Over here!
- Listen to me, Zatarra.

692
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:48,650
Whatever happened to you,
you cannot make it right by staying here on this boat.

693
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:52,910
Go. It's up to you.

694
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:56,830
``We are kings or pawns,"
a man once said.

695
01:05:56,830 --> 01:06:00,750
Si.
Who told you this?

696
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:04,750
Napoleon Bonaparte.

697
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,840
Bonaparte?

698
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:13,470
Oh, Zatarra,
the stories you tell.

699
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:19,520
Someday I may come
to find you.

700
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:23,810
A man is always in need
of a good friend.

701
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:28,030
Truly.

702
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:43,000
Danglars, what's happened?

703
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,960
Captain Reynaud is dead, sir,
and Edmond Dantes disobeyed my orders.

704
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:14,530
Zatarra,
are you all right?

705
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:18,490
Everything's changed.

706
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:22,370
I want you to buy a boat,
just something the two of us can handle.

707
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:26,330
Wait for me to return.
I make my next visit alone.

708
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:35,090
Is-- Is this the home
of Monsieur Morell?

709
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:38,600
My grandfather
isn't well, monsieur.

710
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,970
Even if he were,
he would not receive visitors at 11:00 in the evening.

711
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:44,430
Perhaps he might make
an exception...

712
01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:47,100
for a man who is seeking
E-Edmond Dantes.

713
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:51,780
I apologize
for the hour.

714
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:54,320
Old people never sleep.
Sit down, sit down.

715
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:58,320
-Julianne, some sherry.

716
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:01,450
So, Monsieur Zatarra,

717
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:03,870
you were a friend
of Edmond?

718
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:07,880
- Monsieur Morell?
- Yes?

719
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:20,720
You knew... Edmond also?

720
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:24,730
Like a son.

721
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:29,610
I was hoping you could tell me where
to find his family.

722
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:32,980
Unfortunately,
his father hanged himself...

723
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:36,860
after learning
of Edmond's treason.

724
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:39,360
 I see.

725
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:41,370
I see.

726
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:44,580
And...

727
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:48,580
this...
treason you speak of--

728
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,920
- Who accused him?
- Who knows?

729
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,670
Monsieur Villefort,
the man who had Edmond arrested,

730
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:58,510
left for Paris soon after
to take up the post...

731
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:00,510
of chief prosecutor.

732
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:03,850
Of course, the shock of his father's
violent murder...

733
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:07,850
may also have spurred
his departure.

734
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:11,060
They were strange times.

735
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:15,070
You seem to have fallen
on difficult times yourself, sir.

736
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:19,030
After Edmond's death,
I reluctantly took on a partner.

737
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:22,660
- One of my captains.

738
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:26,040
And then one day,
Danglars forced me out.

739
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:31,830
My fate is nothing
compared to Edmond's.

740
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:37,050
Perhaps your luck
is about to change.

741
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,590
I shall search out
Edmond's fiancee.

742
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:46,600
You mean
the Countess Mondego?

743
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:49,730
- Countess?
- Yes.

744
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:52,730
A month after poor Edmond
was arrested,

745
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:56,230
Mercedes wed
his best friend.

746
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:58,740
- Fernand.
- Yes, that's right.

747
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:01,740
And with the death
of his father and brother in the war,

748
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:04,740
Fernand became Count Mondego.

749
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:08,580
They live in Paris now.

750
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:12,540
Count and Countess Mondego.

751
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:19,550
Are you all right?

752
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:23,260
Yes. I must go.

753
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:26,560
- I'm sorry I was not more helpful.
- Oh, no.

754
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:30,520
You told me
what I needed to know.

755
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:34,730
Edmond Dantes is dead.

756
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:46,660
Zatarra.
Zatarra, you will be so proud of me.

757
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:49,660
I found a nice little skiff.
We couldn't afford a sloop.

758
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:52,040
Got a really good deal.
Za-Zatarra?

759
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:40,670
Whoo-hoo!

760
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:50,680
Zatarra, the boat
cannot hold no more,

761
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:54,680
and there are at least
eight more boatloads down there!

762
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:59,650
Do you not understand?

763
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:03,610
You are wealthier than any man
I have ever heard of.

764
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:09,360
Whatever your problems were,
they are over.

765
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:13,040
What do you want to buy?

766
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,040
Revenge.

767
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18,040
Okay, revenge. Who?

768
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:21,090
Danglars, Villefort,

769
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:23,170
Fernand and Mercedes.

770
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:25,170
Right.

771
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:28,050
We kill these people,
then we spend the treasure.

772
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:32,050
No, we will study them,
learn their weaknesses.

773
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:34,470
Why not just kill them?
I'll do it.

774
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,350
I'll run up to Paris--
bam, bam, bam, bam!

775
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:40,190
I'm back before week's end.
We spend the treasure.

776
01:14:40,190 --> 01:14:42,190
How is this a bad plan?

777
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:45,360
Death is too good for them.

778
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,280
They must suffer
as I suffered.

779
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:51,070
They must see their world,
all they hold dear,

780
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:55,080
ripped from them
as it was ripped from me.

781
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:02,040
You will need a better name than Zatarra
if you are to accomplish that.

782
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:12,550
Then I shall
become a count.

783
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:33,410
I bid you
good afternoon, sir.

784
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:36,540
I'm here to purchase
your lovely home.

785
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:42,420
The very cheek!
I shall have you horsewhipped!

786
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:45,340
Now, get off my property,
you vagabond,

787
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:49,340
before I set the dogs on you,
you hear?

788
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:59,390
Thank you.

789
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,550
Ladies and gentlemen,

790
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:16,180
it is with great honor
that I present to you His Grace,

791
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:20,180
the Count of Monte Cristo.

792
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:36,860
It's so beautiful.

793
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,770
Greetings.

794
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:55,780
My dear count, allow me to introduce
to you my husband,

795
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:57,990
Monsieur Villefort,
Chief Prosecutor.

796
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:59,990
Very kind of you
to think of us.

797
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:02,950
Oh, I am the one honored
with your presence.

798
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:06,910
Now, please,
enjoy yourselves tonight.

799
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:10,460
What do we know about him?

800
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:12,460
Not enough.

801
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:14,840
Where are they?
Are you sure you invited them?

802
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,840
Yes, Your Grace.

803
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:20,840
But I just learned that Count Mondego
has retired for the evening.

804
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:24,930
He has a morning appointment
he cannot miss.

805
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:04,970
You're up early, my dear.

806
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:06,970
Is the Viscount Tourville dead?

807
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:10,980
Unless his heart is situated somewhere
other than the left side of his chest,

808
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:15,310
I suspect he is.

809
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,030
God grant him peace.

810
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:20,860
He did no more than defend
his family's honor.

811
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:24,360
Much good it did him.

812
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:28,370
His wife and I
were happy in our passion. You were happy in your ignorance.

813
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:31,540
Now comes the viscount's
valiant defense of his honor,

814
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:33,540
and you are pained.

815
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:36,710
- She is ruined, and he is dead.
- Don't flatter yourself.

816
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:40,670
I was neither happy
nor ignorant,

817
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:45,050
having known about the last three women
before Madame Tourville.

818
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:49,010
I'm sorry you
are humiliated.

819
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:53,560
The combination of Paris
and me is hardly a recipe for fidelity.

820
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:56,900
And since my attempts at discretion
have evidently failed,

821
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:00,860
there seems little point
in keeping up pretenses.

822
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:05,610
It's actually quite...
liberating.

823
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:09,620
Wouldn't you say?

824
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:11,910
His finances?

825
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:14,420
 He's losing money
at the other casinos.

826
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:16,420
They're not even
cheating him.

827
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:18,420
Have you looked
into his shipping?

828
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:21,090
He got a bank loan for his own boat
several years ago.

829
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:24,680
- Doesn't use Danglars.
- Make sure we own that bank by tomorrow.

830
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:28,680
Tell the other shipping
companies to stay away from Mondego.

831
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:31,430
I want to give him no choice
but to crawl back to Danglars.

832
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:35,390
Now, tell the dealers--
take it all.

833
01:21:38,610 --> 01:21:41,190
Do try to understand.

834
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:44,190
I have a very large
consignment of cotton ready to be sent,

835
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:47,910
and I shall make my payment on the ship
as soon as it is delivered.

836
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:51,910
So obviously I need the vessel
in order to deliver it.

837
01:21:51,950 --> 01:21:55,910
Unfortunately,
the bank can offer no further extensions, Count Mondego.

838
01:21:56,620 --> 01:22:00,590
I suggest you find
alternate means of shipping.

839
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:12,220
Well, well. To what do I owe the honor,
Count Mondego?

840
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:16,770
Can't imagine why you've been
avoiding me after all these years.

841
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:20,480
I'm prepared
to overlook your faults...

842
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:24,150
and perhaps resume
our dealings.

843
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:28,110
Business not going
so well these days?

844
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:44,250
Zatarra?

845
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:55,020
Jacopo.

846
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,140
Did you fall off the bed?

847
01:22:57,140 --> 01:23:01,150
After 13 years of sleeping
on a stone slab, I can't.

848
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:05,980
Mi Maria.
Does that hurt?

849
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:09,700
Did you come here
for a reason?

850
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:13,700
Mondego has a son.

851
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:22,710
- Albert wishes to talk with us.
- Not now!

852
01:23:22,710 --> 01:23:25,300
Tell him I'm trying
to protect his inheritance.

853
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:28,300
Are you afraid he's
going to squander his as you have yours?

854
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:32,220
I don't recall hearing your
complaints when I elevated you from a fishmonger's daughter.

855
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:34,720
Please, I must finish this,
then I shall be going out.

856
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:37,730
May I remind you, my love,
that in Paris there are mistresses aplenty,

857
01:23:37,730 --> 01:23:41,150
but you have
only one son.

858
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:44,570
Come in, Albert.

859
01:23:44,570 --> 01:23:48,240
- For God's sake, be brief.
- I will, Father.

860
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:52,240
Several of my friends
are going to Rome for two weeks during Carnival.

861
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,700
- I would like to accompany them.
- Rome?

862
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:58,250
- And no chaperons? You're only 15.
- Almost 16.

863
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:00,870
Make it my birthday present,
Father, please.

864
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:02,920
- I won't get into trouble.
- No.

865
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:06,880
Of course he can go.
I could do with some peace and quiet around here.

866
01:24:10,590 --> 01:24:12,220
- Rome!

867
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:32,740
Albert!Albert!

868
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:36,740
- Over here! Over here!
- Over here!

869
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,880
Milady?

870
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,920
Can't hide forever.

871
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:34,930
Milady?

872
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:40,970
Who are you, and why
are you doing this?

873
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:43,980
- We are bad men, and for the money.
- My money is in my waistcoat.

874
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:47,980
Not anymore.
Besides, it's not your money we're interested in.

875
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:51,400
You are the only son
of Count Mondego, are you not?

876
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:54,400
Ransom?
Send your note and be damned.

877
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:58,410
I wish it were that easy,
but a note won't reach your father for two weeks,

878
01:25:58,410 --> 01:26:01,910
and then there's the endless
debates about whether we killed you already.

879
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:05,910
No, a note just doesn't have the impact.
Perhaps if we send him your ring.

880
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:10,130
Yes. My ring bears
the Mondego crest.

881
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:14,130
- While still attached to your finger?

882
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:18,840
Listen to me, vermin.

883
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,470
I am Albert, son of Fernand,
Count Mondego,

884
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:25,480
and you have had your last laugh
at my expense.

885
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:29,730
- Do your worst.
- If you insist. Peppone, the knife.

886
01:26:48,210 --> 01:26:50,420
Cut this boy's ropes,

887
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:54,050
or I will be forced to start cutting
your miserable corpses.

888
01:26:54,050 --> 01:26:58,050
Now!

889
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,300
Follow me, young man.
You see the surface? Wait for me there.

890
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:06,310
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Go. We'll talk later.

891
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:14,900
Well done, gentlemen.

892
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:20,070
Many thanks, Your Grace.

893
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:23,280
Albert.

894
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,290
Are you all right?

895
01:27:25,290 --> 01:27:27,960
Sir, I owe you my life.

896
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:30,080
You've had quite an ordeal.

897
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:34,090
You're an extraordinary young man.

898
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:37,840
I insist, you must come to my estate
for breakfast tomorrow.

899
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:40,470
Agreed?

900
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:43,970
Agreed.

901
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:46,270
May I ask
who you are, sir?

902
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:49,560
For the present, your friend.
Tomorrow, your host.

903
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:52,480
For the short time
formality stands between us,

904
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:56,440
the Count of Monte Cristo.

905
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:31,270
He's out in the waiting room.

906
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:33,400
He showed courage
in the tunnels.

907
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:37,400
He's a means to an end.

908
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:44,360
Yes, Your Grace.

909
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:47,990
Young man.

910
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:52,000
Albert, come in. Come, come.

911
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:55,000
Come on.

912
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,340
- You've had quite a night.
- Yes.

913
01:28:57,340 --> 01:28:59,510
What an adventure.

914
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:02,340
Everything's an adventure
when you're young.

915
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:05,010
- One thing puzzles me, sir.
- Hmm.

916
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:07,430
How did you come to know
of my kidnapping?

917
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:09,930
I have many connections,

918
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:12,890
some of which
are less than reputable.

919
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:16,860
I pay well to be informed
of anything of note in any city in which I stay.

920
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:21,440
And the kidnapping
of a count's son is of note.

921
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:25,200
But why risk your life
rescuing me?

922
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,570
The son
of a fellow noble.

923
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:29,580
It was the least
I could do.

924
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:33,580
Judging by your character,
I'm sure you would have done the same.

925
01:29:33,620 --> 01:29:37,630
Your father will
be proud of you.

926
01:29:49,390 --> 01:29:52,930
You must come to Paris
and meet my parents so they may thank you in person.

927
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:56,600
Unfortunately, I cannot.
Business, you see.

928
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:00,610
Please, it is
a matter of honor.

929
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:05,450
-Jacopo?
- Yes, Your Grace?

930
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:07,910
The Spada matter--
where do we stand?

931
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:10,580
- Even now, the gold--
- The shipment?

932
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:14,330
Oh, l-I'm sorry, Your Grace.
The shipment is in transit,

933
01:30:14,330 --> 01:30:17,330
uh, bound for Marseilles.

934
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:21,300
- And it arrives?
- Not for another three weeks, Your Grace.

935
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:25,260
Three weeks? That's more
than enough time to visit in Paris.

936
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:29,260
- Very well.
- Excellent.

937
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:33,270
- And you'll be there just in time.
- In time for?

938
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:53,950
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

939
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:59,960
The Count of Monte Cristo.

940
01:31:07,550 --> 01:31:11,550
Count!

941
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:20,190
- Albert.
- Your Grace. Father!

942
01:31:20,190 --> 01:31:23,320
May I present
the Count of Monte Cristo.

943
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:26,400
- 'Tis a pleasure.
- The pleasure is mine, Count Mondego.

944
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:29,740
I've been looking forward
to this moment for some time.

945
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:32,450
You do me much honor,
when it is I who are indebted to you...

946
01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:36,450
for the rescue of my son.

947
01:31:37,790 --> 01:31:41,790
May I present
the Countess Mondego.

948
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:53,350
Mercedes.

949
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:03,310
Countess.

950
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:08,030
You would have to be a mother
to truly appreciate the service...

951
01:32:08,030 --> 01:32:10,740
you've done
for my son and me.

952
01:32:10,740 --> 01:32:13,410
Monsieur, I shall never forget you.

953
01:32:13,410 --> 01:32:16,080
Please, madame,

954
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,080
it was nothing.

955
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:21,790
I am sure that within a month,
you will not even remember my name.

956
01:32:21,790 --> 01:32:24,670
Hmm?

957
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:26,800
May I steal your wife?

958
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:30,090
- I'm sorry?
- For the waltz.

959
01:32:30,090 --> 01:32:34,050
Of course.

960
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:40,560
Isn't he wonderful, Father?

961
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:56,200
- What's the matter?
- Uh, nothing.

962
01:32:56,200 --> 01:33:00,200
You just remind me
of someone from long ago,

963
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:04,750
someone who was
very dear to me.

964
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:08,170
I'm flattered.
What happened to him?

965
01:33:08,170 --> 01:33:12,170
He died.

966
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:14,800
But I'm not that man.

967
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:18,760
- Monsieur and Madame Villefort.

968
01:33:19,890 --> 01:33:23,890
What are they doing here?

969
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:36,320
Prosecutor Villefort.

970
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:39,620
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, Madame Villefort, monsieur.

971
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:42,620
I'm so glad you could come to see me
while I'm still in town.

972
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:46,170
- We were delightfully
surprised to get your note. - Thank you.

973
01:33:46,170 --> 01:33:50,130
Would you be so kind
as to excuse your husband and I for a moment?

974
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:55,590
I'm told you are an expert
in the interpretation of the law.

975
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:59,640
I have a certain matter
that perhaps you could help me with.

976
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:09,440
Excuse me.

977
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:13,440
Fernand. Fernand!
The toast!

978
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:17,240
Not right now.
I have state business to attend to.

979
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:20,370
Our guests expect it.
Albert expects it.

980
01:34:20,370 --> 01:34:22,790
You give it, my dear.
I'm sure it'll be splendid.

981
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:25,250
You are his father!

982
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:29,210
It is the least you can do.
You know how he admires you.

983
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:31,250
Then he will forgive
my absence.

984
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:34,880
But--

985
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,890
I thought we agreed
not to meet socially.

986
01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:43,270
How could I pass up
the Count of Monte Cristo?

987
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:46,770
Quite.

988
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:49,940
- What do you know of him?
- He's foreign,

989
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:52,480
rich.

990
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,690
I hear he aided
your son.

991
01:34:54,690 --> 01:34:58,490
- Why does he seek your counsel?
- Why should I tell you?

992
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:02,240
When my son
returned from Rome,

993
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:05,620
he mentioned he'd
heard Monte Cristo saying he was expecting a shipment.

994
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:08,330
He also heard the words "gold"...

995
01:35:08,330 --> 01:35:11,790
and ``Spada."

996
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:14,960
- Hmm.
- You don't believe--

997
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,630
Monte Cristo has found
the treasure of Spada.

998
01:35:17,630 --> 01:35:20,760
Not an hour ago,
he asked me to help him avoid troublesome inspections...

999
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:23,390
on a shipment coming
from Marseilles.

1000
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:25,850
- Hmm.
- I could have him arrested.

1001
01:35:25,850 --> 01:35:29,810
Don't do that.
Let's just relieve him of it.

1002
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:33,570
- How do you propose--
- I have an acquaintance who deals in these matters.

1003
01:35:33,570 --> 01:35:36,280
Tell Monte Cristo
you'll get his shipment through Customs,

1004
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:39,360
but that it will
have to stay in port overnight.

1005
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:43,030
I shall have it removed
and taken to my old family estate in Bouchon,

1006
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:47,040
where we shall meet
the following day.

1007
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:51,580
I require 70 percent.

1008
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:53,790
And yet you'll only get 50.

1009
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:57,800
Done.

1010
01:36:04,390 --> 01:36:08,390
Yes, it is, isn't it?

1011
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:18,900
Yes, well, I know. Yes.

1012
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:25,910
Ladies and gentlemen,

1013
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:29,410
unfortunately, my husband has been
detained by business.

1014
01:36:29,410 --> 01:36:33,420
And so it is
left up to me to--

1015
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:37,590
To introduce you...

1016
01:36:37,590 --> 01:36:39,920
to the Count of Monte Cristo
yet again.

1017
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:43,800
You see, I had the audacity
to beg the count...

1018
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:46,720
to allow me to give
the birthday toast to Albert.

1019
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:50,520
I was so insistent, and such
is the graciousness of our host,

1020
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:53,440
that he reluctantly gave up
his fatherly right...

1021
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,730
in order to accommodate a guest,

1022
01:36:55,730 --> 01:36:57,730
even one as boorish
as myself.

1023
01:36:57,730 --> 01:37:00,530
- Ahh.

1024
01:37:00,530 --> 01:37:02,610
Young Albert
has made far too much...

1025
01:37:02,610 --> 01:37:05,370
of the assistance
I gave him in Rome.

1026
01:37:05,370 --> 01:37:07,370
When I arrived
in the catacombs,

1027
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:10,450
I watched as the criminals,
who tied Albert to a wall,

1028
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:13,080
threatened to cut off
his finger and send it to his father...

1029
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:15,080
as evidence
of his abduction.

1030
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:17,040
Goodness!

1031
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:21,010
The boy's reply to all this was...
``Do your worst."

1032
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:26,720
Life is a storm,
my young friend.

1033
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:28,930
You will bask
in the sunlight one moment,

1034
01:37:28,930 --> 01:37:31,730
be shattered on the rocks
the next.

1035
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:33,890
What makes you a man...

1036
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:37,480
is what you do
when that storm comes.

1037
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:41,150
You must look into that storm
and shout, as you did in Rome,

1038
01:37:41,150 --> 01:37:43,650
``Do your worst...

1039
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:45,660
for I will do mine."

1040
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:49,620
Then the fates will know you
as we know you,

1041
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:53,620
as Albert Mondego,
the man.

1042
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:38,540
Giddap!

1043
01:38:52,770 --> 01:38:56,770
Edmond, Villefort told me
that you were executed.

1044
01:38:58,650 --> 01:39:02,150
- Did he?
- Oh, God.

1045
01:39:02,150 --> 01:39:04,740
- Countess, you are mistaken.
Back to the Mondegos'. - No!

1046
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:07,150
- Madame, I'm only thinking
of your reputation. - I beg you, Edmond.

1047
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:09,160
- I don't care how you returned.
- I am not this Edmond.

1048
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:13,160
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!

1049
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:23,050
So, what are you?

1050
01:39:23,550 --> 01:39:27,550
A spirit?
Some ghost sent to torment me?

1051
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:33,850
This Edmond,
you loved him?

1052
01:39:33,850 --> 01:39:35,930
Yes.

1053
01:39:35,930 --> 01:39:38,190
For how long?

1054
01:39:38,190 --> 01:39:41,060
For all of my life.

1055
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:45,070
And how long after he died
before you married the count?

1056
01:39:46,490 --> 01:39:50,490
That isn't fair.

1057
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:57,200
We've reached your home,
Countess.

1058
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:16,220
You're right.
You cannot be my Edmond.

1059
01:40:17,980 --> 01:40:21,190
Well, there you are.
You said it yourself.

1060
01:40:21,190 --> 01:40:25,150
Edmond Dantes is dead.
Good night.

1061
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:30,950
Countess.

1062
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:37,290
If you ever again presume
to interfere in my affairs,

1063
01:40:37,290 --> 01:40:40,910
I will, I promise, finish the job
I started the day we met.

1064
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:44,130
Do you understand?

1065
01:40:44,130 --> 01:40:46,630
- I understand you are mad.
- Mad?

1066
01:40:46,630 --> 01:40:49,720
My enemies are falling
into my traps perfectly.

1067
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:51,760
Mad, Your Grace,
for ignoring this:

1068
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:55,260
You have a fortune,
a beautiful woman who loves you.

1069
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:58,600
Take the money,
take the woman and live your life.

1070
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:00,930
Stop this plan.
Take what you have won.

1071
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:04,940
- I can't.
- Why not?

1072
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:15,620
I am still your man, Zatarra.

1073
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:19,580
I swore an oath.
I will protect you.

1074
01:41:19,620 --> 01:41:23,620
Even if it means I must
protect you from yourself.

1075
01:41:24,830 --> 01:41:28,630
I'll drive you home now.

1076
01:41:28,630 --> 01:41:32,630
I'll walk.

1077
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,970
Put two chests
on the Pharaon for our cut.

1078
01:42:14,010 --> 01:42:18,010
Mondego will never notice.

1079
01:42:37,870 --> 01:42:41,830
Come on.
Get aboard.

1080
01:42:46,830 --> 01:42:50,840
- Philippe Danglars?
- Yeah?

1081
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:54,840
You are charged with the theft of goods
from a certain merchant ship.

1082
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,890
This is absurd.

1083
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:02,010
We can resolve
this matter easily.

1084
01:43:02,010 --> 01:43:06,020
These men will perform
a search of your vessel.

1085
01:43:09,810 --> 01:43:13,820
Count Mondego set me up.

1086
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:18,410
But I'll not hang for him.

1087
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:37,300
Who are you?

1088
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:41,300
I'm the Count of Monte Cristo.
But my friends call me Edmond Dantes.

1089
01:43:42,010 --> 01:43:44,770
Dantes?

1090
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,820
Cut him down before
he can't talk.

1091
01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:18,220
Boy, don't do that.
That's-- That's too much.

1092
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:20,340
My dear Villefort.

1093
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:23,050
I hope you don't mind
if I join you for a short while.

1094
01:44:23,050 --> 01:44:27,060
Your Grace,
I was not expecting you.

1095
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:30,980
I want to thank you in person
for helping me with my shipment.

1096
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:34,060
That, yes. l-I made all
the arrangements earlier.

1097
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:36,820
I can promise you there'll be
no more problems from our end.

1098
01:44:36,820 --> 01:44:40,820
Excellent. I think this
could be the start of a long and fruitful relationship.

1099
01:44:42,490 --> 01:44:46,450
Speaking of which,
may I pose a question?

1100
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:51,120
Yes, of course.
Anything in the world.

1101
01:44:51,370 --> 01:44:55,000
I was just curious.

1102
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,960
Why did you tell
Countess Mondego 16 years ago...

1103
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:02,260
that Edmond Dantes
had been executed?

1104
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:04,260
Hmm?

1105
01:45:04,260 --> 01:45:08,140
Uh, I don't understand.
Wh-What on earth are you talking about?

1106
01:45:08,140 --> 01:45:11,230
It's a perfectly
simple question.

1107
01:45:11,230 --> 01:45:14,860
How do you know these things?

1108
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:17,820
- That's, uh--

1109
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:20,280
That's quite enough.

1110
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:23,610
Whew! You don't understand.
Dantes was accepting a letter from Napoleon.

1111
01:45:23,610 --> 01:45:26,870
- That was clearly treason.
- But we both know he never delivered it.

1112
01:45:26,870 --> 01:45:30,200
Packing a man off to prison
with such knowledge is bad enough. But to tell--

1113
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:33,080
Your Grace, I have no idea
what is provoking this perverse discussion.

1114
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:37,090
Now I ask myself,
``What did my old friend Villefort stand to gain...

1115
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:41,550
by telling Mercedes
that Edmond Dantes is dead?"

1116
01:45:43,050 --> 01:45:46,220
The answer is...
absolutely nothing.

1117
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:48,930
Just as you say, nothing.
So why--

1118
01:45:48,930 --> 01:45:51,390
But if my old friend,
now chief prosecutor of France,

1119
01:45:51,390 --> 01:45:55,400
doesn't gain from this lie,
well, who does?

1120
01:45:56,230 --> 01:45:59,320
My dear Count, it's far too hot in here
and you're fully dressed.

1121
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:02,150
- It's time we both left.
- I think the clearest beneficiary...

1122
01:46:02,150 --> 01:46:06,160
is Fernand, Count Mondego.

1123
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:11,250
I don't understand what
this inquisition has to do with our business relationship.

1124
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:15,250
I'm about to tell you.

1125
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:20,090
Sit down, Mondego.

1126
01:46:20,090 --> 01:46:23,050
I'm an ambitious man.
And I have furthered these ambitions...

1127
01:46:23,050 --> 01:46:26,590
by scooping up Bonapartists.

1128
01:46:26,590 --> 01:46:28,600
But now with Napoleon
on the loose, I have,

1129
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:31,270
shall I say,
a thorn in my side.

1130
01:46:31,270 --> 01:46:34,310
Once merely an irritation,
now potentially lethal.

1131
01:46:34,310 --> 01:46:37,190
- Be lethal in turn.
- Well, the problem is such...

1132
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:39,650
that l, myself,
cannot attend to it.

1133
01:46:39,650 --> 01:46:43,650
So I have a proposition
for you.

1134
01:46:46,530 --> 01:46:48,950
How is your father?

1135
01:46:48,950 --> 01:46:51,450
Alive, unfortunately.

1136
01:46:51,450 --> 01:46:55,410
We share the same misfortune.

1137
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:02,380
You remember?

1138
01:47:12,970 --> 01:47:15,350
Why is this door locked?

1139
01:47:15,350 --> 01:47:18,060
I demand that you release me
from this room at once.

1140
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:20,060
You've proved yourself
no friend of mine.

1141
01:47:20,060 --> 01:47:23,150
Your father was a loyal supporter
of Napoleon, wasn't he?

1142
01:47:23,150 --> 01:47:26,150
Possibly involved in plotting
Napoleon's escape from Elba.

1143
01:47:26,150 --> 01:47:29,030
The emperor arrives soon!

1144
01:47:29,030 --> 01:47:32,080
An inconvenient parent for
an ambitious civil servant.

1145
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:36,080
But then he died, suddenly
and opportunely murdered, again some 16 years ago.

1146
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:40,170
The Emperor Napoleon.

1147
01:47:42,170 --> 01:47:46,130
The murderer never apprehended.
How hard did you look for him?

1148
01:47:46,130 --> 01:47:48,720
You have no proof,
no witnesses.

1149
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:52,140
You just have theories.
J-Just conjectures.

1150
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:56,100
On the contrary.
I have Count Mondego.

1151
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:59,400
Young Mondego. Why?

1152
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:03,400
Because your son
lacked the courage.

1153
01:48:04,530 --> 01:48:07,030
 Mondego is the one
who pulled the trigger!

1154
01:48:07,030 --> 01:48:09,150
He'd never confess
in a million years!

1155
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:11,700
You're right,
he wouldn't.

1156
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:15,660
- But you just have.

1157
01:48:18,330 --> 01:48:22,290
Monsieur Villefort,
you are under arrest for conspiracy to murder.

1158
01:48:23,130 --> 01:48:27,130
You remember?

1159
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:34,470
Dantes?

1160
01:48:55,490 --> 01:48:59,500
A courtesy for a gentleman.

1161
01:49:24,610 --> 01:49:27,440
You didn't think
I'd make it that easy, did you?

1162
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:31,400
Hyah!

1163
01:49:46,590 --> 01:49:50,550
Edmond?

1164
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:58,510
I thought we had
finished our conversation in the carriage.

1165
01:49:58,510 --> 01:50:02,520
So did I.

1166
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:06,610
Until I realized...

1167
01:50:06,610 --> 01:50:10,570
you said the name ``Dantes."

1168
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:14,740
A name that
I had never mentioned.

1169
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:22,160
What do you want of me?

1170
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:24,920
I want to be free of you,

1171
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:28,920
the way you obviously
are free of me.

1172
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:34,260
Just a few answers from you,
and I shall be gone forever.

1173
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:40,260
Ask your questions.

1174
01:50:47,310 --> 01:50:51,280
Where have you been?

1175
01:50:51,860 --> 01:50:55,530
Thirteen years in
the Chateau d'lf...

1176
01:50:55,530 --> 01:50:59,490
and everywhere else
you can imagine.

1177
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:04,290
The Chateau d'lf
for 13 years.

1178
01:51:07,370 --> 01:51:09,420
Did you suffer?

1179
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:13,420
 Are you finished now?
I have a good deal on my mind.

1180
01:51:14,630 --> 01:51:16,840
- What happened afterward?
- Much.

1181
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:19,340
- Why did you not come to me?
- Why did you not wait?

1182
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:21,850
You married the very man
who betrayed--

1183
01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:25,810
I told you that night
on the rocks, remember?

1184
01:51:27,730 --> 01:51:31,690
That it would never leave my finger.
And it never has.

1185
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:37,320
- Why?
- You know why.

1186
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:42,490
If you ever loved me,

1187
01:51:42,490 --> 01:51:44,910
don't--
don't rob me of my hate.

1188
01:51:44,910 --> 01:51:46,910
It's all I have.

1189
01:51:46,910 --> 01:51:50,880
Let it go, Edmond.
Let it go.

1190
01:51:51,630 --> 01:51:54,920
I don't know what dark plan
lies within you.

1191
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:57,590
Nor do I know by what design
we were asked...

1192
01:51:57,590 --> 01:51:59,930
to live without
each other these 16 years.

1193
01:51:59,930 --> 01:52:02,970
- But God has offered us
a new beginning-- - God?

1194
01:52:02,970 --> 01:52:05,890
Don't slap His hand away.

1195
01:52:05,890 --> 01:52:07,890
Can I never escape Him?

1196
01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:11,860
No. He is in everything.

1197
01:52:14,940 --> 01:52:18,950
Even in a kiss.

1198
01:53:11,290 --> 01:53:14,080
My lady?

1199
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:16,840
Where's the count?

1200
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:20,050
Um, the count would like
for you to join him this afternoon.

1201
01:53:20,050 --> 01:53:23,300
-Join him?
- Uh, yes,

1202
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:27,260
in, uh, leaving the country
with your son.

1203
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:33,770
Mmm, uh, I'll have someone
bring you to your house...

1204
01:53:33,770 --> 01:53:35,480
and you just
wait there for me.

1205
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:37,820
- And we just--
- Thank you!

1206
01:53:37,820 --> 01:53:40,490
- Yes, yes, but--
- I need to go home and pack.

1207
01:53:40,490 --> 01:53:44,450
Yes, yes. My lady--

1208
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:50,700
- Where's the count?
- Upstairs, my lady.

1209
01:53:58,340 --> 01:54:00,380
What's wrong?

1210
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:04,340
I'm bankrupt.
All my debts have been called in.

1211
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:08,640
- Also, I'm to be arrested.
- For what?

1212
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:11,680
Piracy, corruption
and murder.

1213
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:15,400
- Did you do all these things?
- Yes.

1214
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:17,940
There is simply not time to talk.
The gendarmes are on the way,

1215
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:20,610
apparently, so hurry up
and pack something.

1216
01:54:20,610 --> 01:54:24,610
I'm not going
with you, Fernand.

1217
01:54:31,950 --> 01:54:35,170
You are my wife.

1218
01:54:35,170 --> 01:54:38,380
I have made
arrangements for us.

1219
01:54:38,380 --> 01:54:41,420
We shall be very well
taken care of.

1220
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:44,590
Now go and find my son.

1221
01:54:44,590 --> 01:54:48,010
- He's not your son.
- I beg your pardon?

1222
01:54:48,010 --> 01:54:52,020
Albert Mondego is the son
of Edmond Dantes.

1223
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:01,530
Why do you think I rushed off
so quickly to marry you after Edmond was taken away?

1224
01:55:11,790 --> 01:55:15,790
Premature.

1225
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:35,850
Well, aren't you
a piece of work.

1226
01:55:35,850 --> 01:55:39,860
So he's the bastard son
of a dead traitor.

1227
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:44,940
He always was disappointing.

1228
01:55:55,660 --> 01:55:59,670
Good-bye, Mercedes.
You did please me some of the time.

1229
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:08,840
You never pleased me.

1230
01:56:58,810 --> 01:57:02,810
What is this?

1231
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:19,160
Monte Cristo.

1232
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:24,840
King's to you, Fernand.

1233
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:35,010
Edmond?

1234
01:57:35,850 --> 01:57:38,100
But how--

1235
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:42,100
How did I escape?
With difficulty.

1236
01:57:42,770 --> 01:57:46,730
How did I plan this moment?
With pleasure.

1237
01:57:47,690 --> 01:57:50,940
- So you've taken Mercedes?

1238
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:53,360
And everything else...

1239
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:57,370
except your life.

1240
01:57:57,620 --> 01:57:59,750
Why are you doing this?

1241
01:57:59,750 --> 01:58:03,710
It's complicated.

1242
01:58:03,870 --> 01:58:07,880
Let's just say it's vengeance
for the life you stole from me.

1243
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:21,390
Well, I see someone
has taught you the sword.

1244
01:58:21,390 --> 01:58:24,310
How did you ever
call yourself my friend?

1245
01:58:24,310 --> 01:58:27,860
- We were friends, Edmond.

1246
01:58:27,860 --> 01:58:30,730
You sent me to hell!

1247
01:58:30,730 --> 01:58:34,240
Why?

1248
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:36,950
Take your vengeance.

1249
01:58:36,950 --> 01:58:40,910
But know the blood
you spill is noble.

1250
01:58:41,660 --> 01:58:43,710
Blood that will never
run through your veins.

1251
01:58:43,710 --> 01:58:47,710
You're no more a count
than I am a commoner!

1252
01:58:54,050 --> 01:58:58,050
You don't have it in you.

1253
01:59:02,350 --> 01:59:06,150
- Touch him, and I'll kill you.
- Boy, let me explain.

1254
01:59:06,150 --> 01:59:09,940
It's been explained.
I spoke to Madame Villefort on the street.

1255
01:59:09,940 --> 01:59:12,780
She told me how I was a silly,
trusting dupe that my friend,

1256
01:59:12,780 --> 01:59:15,240
the Count of Monte Cristo,
used to get into our lives.

1257
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:17,240
- Albert, listen to me.
- I will not!

1258
01:59:17,240 --> 01:59:20,410
Forgive me for being
such a fool, Father.

1259
01:59:20,410 --> 01:59:22,700
You were betrayed.
Of course you're forgiven.

1260
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:24,870
You were my friend.
I looked up to you.

1261
01:59:24,870 --> 01:59:26,960
There's a history here
you know nothing about.

1262
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:29,880
He loved your mother,
and yet she chose me.

1263
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:33,880
- Now he intends to steal her away.
- Lie. Get out of my way!

1264
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:38,930
Boy, if I have to,
I will kill you.

1265
01:59:38,930 --> 01:59:41,140
I will not stop now.

1266
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:43,970
- Nor will I.
- So be it.

1267
01:59:43,970 --> 01:59:47,980
No!

1268
02:00:03,740 --> 02:00:07,330
Albert,

1269
02:00:07,330 --> 02:00:11,250
I found the note you left
explaining where you'd gone.

1270
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:15,260
But now I must
explain something to you.

1271
02:00:16,470 --> 02:00:19,260
Where you really come from.

1272
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:23,220
Albert,you are
the son of Edmond Dantes.

1273
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:33,980
The man you know as
the Count of Monte Cristo.

1274
02:00:47,370 --> 02:00:49,460
Well, I'm afraid
it is true.

1275
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:53,130
You are the walking proof
that your mother was as much of a whore...

1276
02:00:53,130 --> 02:00:55,750
in her younger years
as she is today.

1277
02:00:55,750 --> 02:00:59,720
You--

1278
02:01:01,010 --> 02:01:03,140
You let me fight him?

1279
02:01:03,140 --> 02:01:06,010
It didn't do
any good though, did it?

1280
02:01:06,010 --> 02:01:08,770
Fernand, I beg you.
No more!

1281
02:01:08,770 --> 02:01:12,020
I want no more of this.

1282
02:01:12,020 --> 02:01:16,020
Just go.
Call it mercy.

1283
02:01:16,820 --> 02:01:20,780
Mercy, Fernand.

1284
02:01:25,030 --> 02:01:29,040
You've only got one shot,
and it will take more than that to stop me.

1285
02:01:30,370 --> 02:01:34,380
Well, then I'd best
put it where it will do the most damage.

1286
02:01:35,590 --> 02:01:38,050
No!

1287
02:01:38,050 --> 02:01:40,510
Mother! Mother!

1288
02:01:40,510 --> 02:01:44,510
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Look what I've done.Jacopo!

1289
02:01:48,060 --> 02:01:52,060
Hyah!

1290
02:01:54,860 --> 02:01:56,940
Once again, Zatarra,

1291
02:01:56,940 --> 02:01:59,280
God sees you out of
the corner of His eye.

1292
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:03,280
She'll live.

1293
02:02:34,230 --> 02:02:36,860
- Edmond!

1294
02:02:36,860 --> 02:02:39,940
Edmond!

1295
02:02:39,940 --> 02:02:43,610
Please don't go
out there. Don't.

1296
02:02:43,610 --> 02:02:45,950
Edmond, don't go.

1297
02:02:45,950 --> 02:02:49,490
You try.
Don't ever quit.

1298
02:02:49,490 --> 02:02:52,120
Zatarra,

1299
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:56,130
you must end this.

1300
02:02:56,960 --> 02:03:00,420
Even the priest
will understand that.

1301
02:03:00,420 --> 02:03:04,380
- Edmond!
Please don't leave.

1302
02:03:06,890 --> 02:03:10,850
Watch over your mother.

1303
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:33,250
Now, I couldn't live in a world
where you have everything and I have nothing.

1304
02:05:15,390 --> 02:05:18,180
What happened
to your mercy?

1305
02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:22,150
I'm a count,
not a saint.

1306
02:06:03,650 --> 02:06:07,650
You were right, priest.
You were right.

1307
02:06:09,820 --> 02:06:12,360
This I promise you...

1308
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:16,370
and God:

1309
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:20,120
All that was used
for vengeance...

1310
02:06:20,120 --> 02:06:24,080
will now be used for good.

1311
02:06:24,380 --> 02:06:28,380
So rest in peace, my friend.

1312
02:06:28,630 --> 02:06:31,880
So, Zatarra,

1313
02:06:31,880 --> 02:06:34,260
painful, huh?

1314
02:06:34,260 --> 02:06:38,220
No.

1315
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:46,480
I bought this place,
thinking one day I would tear it down.

1316
02:06:47,690 --> 02:06:50,480
But now the only things
I care about...

1317
02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:54,490
are walking off
this island with me (Subs by Laughfish).

1318
02:06:55,305 --> 02:07:01,435
