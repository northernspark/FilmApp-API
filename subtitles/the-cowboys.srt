Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,646
Easy.

3
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:23,308
Easy, girl.

4
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:33,571
Easy, girl.

5
00:06:35,115 --> 00:06:36,409
Easy.

6
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,953
Hold it, girl.

7
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:40,456
Hold it.

8
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,883
Well, I want each of you fellas...

9
00:06:48,968 --> 00:06:52,680
...to buy yourself a $1 Ingersoll watch.

10
00:06:52,806 --> 00:06:54,892
You can't break 'em with a hammer and...

11
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:57,728
...won't lose more than a minute a month.

12
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,316
- I know we're late, Mr. Andersen.
- You're two hours late!

13
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:04,071
Work starts around here at 6:00 a.m.

14
00:07:04,155 --> 00:07:05,823
- Goes for everybody.
- Yes, sir.

15
00:07:05,907 --> 00:07:07,409
We spent the night in Bozeman.

16
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:09,161
Town's empty as a bone orchard.

17
00:07:09,286 --> 00:07:11,079
Everybody's lit out for the Ruby River.

18
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,041
- What for?
- Gold.

19
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,710
At the Ruby?

20
00:07:14,836 --> 00:07:16,254
Played out years ago.

21
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:18,923
No. This is a new strike.
About 20 miles above there.

22
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:21,553
Almost to the Beaverhead.
Tell him, Smiley.

23
00:07:22,637 --> 00:07:25,307
Well, the fact is,
me and the boys thought...

24
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:28,644
...we'd like to take a ride up
and have ourselves a little look-see.

25
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:33,651
Got 1,500 head o' steer to get
to Belle Fourche before it snows on me.

26
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:35,988
You're hired on to move 'em.

27
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:39,869
- We'd like to help you out...
- LLike to help me out?

28
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,371
The others done pulled out.

29
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,792
There's only five of us left.

30
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:47,587
That busts it.

31
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,132
You work us night and day,
and Christmas, too!

32
00:07:50,217 --> 00:07:52,886
- Pay ya every Saturday!
- There's easier money around.

33
00:07:53,011 --> 00:07:54,221
We'll do it this way.

34
00:07:54,304 --> 00:07:57,558
We'll take a ride up there and look around,
two or three weeks.

35
00:07:57,684 --> 00:08:00,687
If it don't work,
we'll get the others and come right back.

36
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,690
You have my word on that.
Don't he, boys?

37
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:03,525
That's right.

38
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,235
- Your word?
- Yes, sir.

39
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:07,072
Well, here's my word.

40
00:08:07,656 --> 00:08:09,741
Get the hell off my spread!

41
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,702
Now!

42
00:08:20,214 --> 00:08:21,382
Miserable.

43
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:34,483
Well, they run...

44
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:38,195
...clean out from under me.
Whole damn bunch of 'em.

45
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,032
I heard most of it. LLet me see that.

46
00:08:44,204 --> 00:08:47,332
A fool comes to town
with a fistful of gold dust and...

47
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:51,004
...every jackass in 50 miles around
lights out after him.

48
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,260
My day a man'd stay with you
on a handshake.

49
00:08:55,887 --> 00:08:57,513
It's a different day, Wil.

50
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:58,806
Yeah.

51
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:03,354
Well, I guess I'll go over to
the Bigelow place, see what I can turn up.

52
00:09:03,772 --> 00:09:04,982
Maybe Henry...

53
00:09:05,065 --> 00:09:07,276
Henry Bigelow's 60 years old, Wil.

54
00:09:09,404 --> 00:09:10,531
So am I.

55
00:09:36,607 --> 00:09:38,610
Kinda noisy around here.

56
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:41,071
It's been like this all week.

57
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,032
Any luck?

58
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:45,494
No.

59
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:49,624
I traveled 30 miles today...

60
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:53,087
...didn't find a single hand that could...

61
00:09:54,297 --> 00:09:55,883
...throw in with me.

62
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:59,805
- Did you talk to Parker?
- Yeah.

63
00:10:00,847 --> 00:10:02,683
His wife's gonna have a baby.

64
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:04,854
How about Miller?

65
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,356
His wife wants to have a baby.

66
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,443
Sucker's only been married three weeks.

67
00:10:25,506 --> 00:10:29,677
Well, if you can't get your cattle
to market this year, put it off till next.

68
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:33,224
What'll I do with this year's bills?

69
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:37,187
Pay 'em next year.
Hell, a lot of folks around here do.

70
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:39,273
No, I won't go on tick.

71
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:46,325
If your neck was any stiffer...

72
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,536
...you couldn't even bend over
to pull your boots on!

73
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:54,753
Shut up and pour!

74
00:11:13,527 --> 00:11:15,738
Did ya ever think of hirin' boys?

75
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:17,282
What boys?

76
00:11:17,407 --> 00:11:18,618
The schoolboys.

77
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:20,870
Oh, sure, and women.

78
00:11:21,038 --> 00:11:24,708
How about my momma in Cedar City?
She's only 92.

79
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,296
You ain't got a lot of choices.

80
00:11:27,463 --> 00:11:30,216
There ain't a kid in that school over 15.

81
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,970
They're between hay and grass.
I need men.

82
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:36,016
How old was you when you went
on your first cattle drive?

83
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,936
- What difference does that make?
- How old was you, Wil?

84
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,022
- Well, in my day...
- How old?

85
00:11:41,356 --> 00:11:42,607
Thirteen.

86
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,237
And my old man's pants fit me.

87
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,614
"This convenient arrangement
is designed...

88
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:50,618
"...to adjust ladies' long dresses
to a walking length.

89
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:54,124
"It is worn around the waist,
has two ends..."

90
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,130
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

91
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:00,840
'Afternoon, Miss Ellen.

92
00:12:01,258 --> 00:12:04,721
Have you gentlemen decided
you need some additional schooling?

93
00:12:05,097 --> 00:12:08,934
Well, I guess we could probably use some,
but we just come visitin'.

94
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:10,770
Well, come in.

95
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,482
Please, sit down.

96
00:12:29,795 --> 00:12:31,465
It isn't often we get visitors.

97
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:35,595
We were reading
from the Montgomery Ward Catalogue.

98
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:39,559
The grammar's quite correct
and it's always most interesting.

99
00:12:40,268 --> 00:12:42,646
Elizabeth, would you continue, please?

100
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:46,984
"...the longer of which has a nickel clasp...

101
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:50,990
"...which holds the bottom
of the skirt to any desirable height...

102
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:53,661
"...the shorter one,
a hook for holding a fan.

103
00:12:53,911 --> 00:12:57,749
"This elevator has been worn in Chicago
during the past season a great deal...

104
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,628
"...and ladies consider it
almost indispensable."

105
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:02,214
Thank you, Elizabeth.

106
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:05,926
Now, let us hear how well the boys do.

107
00:13:06,177 --> 00:13:09,348
Put away your catalogues
and take out your readers.

108
00:13:13,688 --> 00:13:15,064
Charles Hunnicutt.

109
00:13:15,356 --> 00:13:17,818
Would you read today's assignment for us?

110
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:29,166
"Hail to thee, blith..."

111
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,545
Blith?

112
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:34,340
Blithe.

113
00:13:35,092 --> 00:13:38,596
"...blithe spirit, bird thou never wert."

114
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:41,057
Weren't?

115
00:13:42,225 --> 00:13:44,020
"Bird thou never wert."

116
00:13:48,358 --> 00:13:51,111
"That from heaven or near it
Pourest thy..."

117
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:52,698
Get away!

118
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:54,283
- What have you got?
- Nothing.

119
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:57,537
Homer, take your hand
from behind your back!

120
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:02,377
And open it!

121
00:14:08,344 --> 00:14:10,764
Stop it! Now stop it!

122
00:14:11,057 --> 00:14:12,224
Sit down!

123
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,215
Give it up, Wil.

124
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,635
Can't move heaven and earth.

125
00:14:41,638 --> 00:14:42,806
Well...

126
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,143
Whatcha thinkin' about?

127
00:14:48,106 --> 00:14:49,148
You.

128
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,236
Stringy women like you live a long time.

129
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:57,075
Sisters have seen all their husbands
put under.

130
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,787
More than likely you will, too.

131
00:15:01,206 --> 00:15:02,666
And I don't wanna...

132
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,211
...see you end up somebody's fry cook.

133
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,341
I've been your fry cook for 40 years.

134
00:15:10,051 --> 00:15:11,720
A pretty good one, too.

135
00:15:12,971 --> 00:15:14,432
It's gettin' chilly.

136
00:15:14,683 --> 00:15:16,768
Come on in, have a cup o' coffee.

137
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:20,022
I'll be in.

138
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:02,616
Damn Anse!

139
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:05,121
He put 'em up to this.

140
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,378
I'd better jump straight down their throat
and get it over with.

141
00:17:15,593 --> 00:17:17,094
Don't be hard on 'em.

142
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:21,517
They must've traveled half the night
to get here this early.

143
00:17:28,818 --> 00:17:29,986
Good morning, boys.

144
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,198
Good morning, Mr. Andersen.

145
00:17:37,497 --> 00:17:40,167
LLooks like it's gonna be another fine day.

146
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:44,506
What can I do for ya?

147
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,010
Anse Petersen says you're lookin'
for hands for your drive.

148
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:50,682
We come to put in for the job.

149
00:17:53,435 --> 00:17:56,689
Well, any of ya ever been on a cattle drive?

150
00:18:00,736 --> 00:18:02,697
Any of ya ever herded cattle?

151
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,412
Well, what can you do?

152
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:09,790
We can all ride.

153
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:14,713
Most of us can rope.
Couple of us are pretty good shots.

154
00:18:15,338 --> 00:18:16,966
Well, that's somethin'.

155
00:18:19,928 --> 00:18:23,098
You know, trail drivin' is
no Sunday school picnic.

156
00:18:24,642 --> 00:18:27,021
You gotta figure you're dealin'
with the dumbest...

157
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,233
...orneriest critter on God's green earth.

158
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:34,489
A cow's nothin' but a lot of trouble
tied up in a leather bag.

159
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,243
A horse ain't much better.

160
00:18:41,665 --> 00:18:43,251
Speakin' of a horse...

161
00:18:46,338 --> 00:18:49,967
Got me a little green broke filly over there.

162
00:18:51,094 --> 00:18:52,555
Name's Crazy Alice.

163
00:18:53,307 --> 00:18:57,102
Now if one of you was to stay aboard her,
for, say, a count of 10...

164
00:18:58,063 --> 00:19:01,066
...I might just keep that in mind
come hirin' time.

165
00:19:16,295 --> 00:19:17,463
Thank you.

166
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,574
Steady, girl, steady.

167
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:07,488
Easy.

168
00:20:18,294 --> 00:20:19,962
Easy. Here we are.

169
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,149
Who's first?

170
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,990
Well, I'll try and saddle her
while you're makin' up your mind.

171
00:20:56,136 --> 00:20:57,596
Made up your mind?

172
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:01,644
I'll go first.

173
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:18,666
I'll start countin' when you hit the saddle.

174
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,945
Five. Six.

175
00:21:41,155 --> 00:21:42,406
Seven. Eight.

176
00:21:44,032 --> 00:21:45,201
Time!

177
00:21:45,953 --> 00:21:47,496
Get off of her!

178
00:21:57,801 --> 00:21:59,261
My name's Hunnicutt.

179
00:21:59,846 --> 00:22:00,972
I'm 15.

180
00:22:02,015 --> 00:22:03,851
And everybody calls me Slim.

181
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,777
Easy, girl.

182
00:22:10,985 --> 00:22:12,028
I'm next.

183
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,913
Easy, girl. Easy.

184
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,294
She's rank. Keep your mind in the middle.

185
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,569
Bail off, youngster! Bail off!

186
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:50,163
My name's Homer Weems, Mr. Andersen.

187
00:22:50,247 --> 00:22:52,874
And I hope I ain't rode
all the rough off of her.

188
00:23:12,901 --> 00:23:14,987
- You all right, boy?
- Yes, sir.

189
00:23:15,405 --> 00:23:17,992
My name's Clyde Potter.
They call me Fats.

190
00:23:18,742 --> 00:23:20,411
Tendin' toward the gut myself.

191
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:32,343
My name's...

192
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:35,764
His name's Bob Wilson. He gets excited.

193
00:23:46,863 --> 00:23:49,157
I'm Charlie Schwartz. I'm Jewish.

194
00:23:50,034 --> 00:23:52,453
I've settled it every place in town but here.

195
00:23:53,414 --> 00:23:55,124
Must keep ya pretty busy.

196
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:57,460
All right, who's next?

197
00:23:57,711 --> 00:23:58,796
I am.

198
00:24:05,138 --> 00:24:06,348
Good mornin'.

199
00:24:09,017 --> 00:24:10,310
Close the gate.

200
00:25:05,802 --> 00:25:07,137
Did ya see that?

201
00:25:32,337 --> 00:25:34,632
Here, boy. I think you can handle her now.

202
00:25:34,757 --> 00:25:36,091
Keep it.

203
00:25:43,268 --> 00:25:45,145
All right, break it up.

204
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:46,689
Break it up!

205
00:25:48,233 --> 00:25:51,529
Come on, Slim, get back on the fence.

206
00:25:52,781 --> 00:25:53,949
Hurry it up.

207
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,703
Settle down!

208
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,792
You all right?

209
00:26:00,917 --> 00:26:01,918
Yes, sir.

210
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,589
I didn't see you at the school.

211
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,633
I don't go to school.

212
00:26:08,718 --> 00:26:09,846
Got a name?

213
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,305
Cimarron.

214
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,016
That's half a name. What's the rest of it?

215
00:26:16,478 --> 00:26:19,482
There's no more name.
I'm a mistake of nature.

216
00:26:31,124 --> 00:26:33,418
That was a pretty good ride you made.

217
00:26:36,298 --> 00:26:38,341
But I'll have to think you over.

218
00:27:24,862 --> 00:27:27,240
You having difficulty seeing the board?

219
00:27:27,573 --> 00:27:31,203
Homer, Bob, why don't you take
these slates and pads...

220
00:27:31,996 --> 00:27:35,166
...put them underneath the board
and raise it up...

221
00:27:36,335 --> 00:27:38,963
...so that everyone can see the lower lines.

222
00:27:44,555 --> 00:27:46,265
There, that's much better.

223
00:27:46,473 --> 00:27:47,474
Thank you, boys.

224
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:51,021
When you've copied your assignments
for the week you may all go home.

225
00:27:57,572 --> 00:28:01,994
I'd like to talk to these boys
before class breaks up, if you don't mind.

226
00:28:03,454 --> 00:28:06,040
Do you wish to address
the young ladies, as well?

227
00:28:06,917 --> 00:28:08,753
No, I don't think so.

228
00:28:09,629 --> 00:28:11,882
I've nothing to say to young ladies.

229
00:28:14,928 --> 00:28:18,600
Then we bow to the fact
that it's a man's world and leave you to it.

230
00:28:18,683 --> 00:28:19,767
Girls...

231
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,850
I don't expect to get to...

232
00:28:51,185 --> 00:28:53,939
...Belle Fourche with one
single head of beef...

233
00:28:55,232 --> 00:28:56,816
...but I'm cornered...

234
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,779
...so I'm takin' you on.

235
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,951
Now this is the way it's gonna be.

236
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:05,328
I'm a man and you're boys.

237
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:08,374
Not cowmen, not by a damned sight.

238
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,338
Nothin' but cowboys,
just like the word says.

239
00:29:12,964 --> 00:29:16,968
And I'm gonna remind ya of it
every single minute of every day and night.

240
00:29:26,189 --> 00:29:27,816
This is the Double-O.

241
00:29:29,861 --> 00:29:31,530
This is Belle Fourche.

242
00:29:31,864 --> 00:29:36,369
In between is 400 miles
of the meanest country in the West.

243
00:29:37,663 --> 00:29:40,500
And the only way
we're gonna get through is if...

244
00:29:40,584 --> 00:29:42,043
...you take orders.

245
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:43,379
Is that clear?

246
00:29:43,713 --> 00:29:44,880
Yes, sir.

247
00:29:44,964 --> 00:29:46,841
Bring a bedroll...

248
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,095
...a couple of good ropes...

249
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:50,972
...horse, if you've got one.

250
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:54,351
You'll get the best food in the territory...

251
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:57,231
...no rest, and damn little sleep.

252
00:29:58,316 --> 00:30:00,985
And 50 big silver dollars...

253
00:30:01,903 --> 00:30:03,989
...if we make it to Belle Fourche.

254
00:30:04,699 --> 00:30:06,911
Now you'll show up at my place...

255
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,080
...first Monday after school's out,
at 5:00 a.m.

256
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:13,710
And come with grit teeth.

257
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:17,841
'Cause, gentlemen,
that's when school really begins.

258
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:20,595
Mr. Andersen?

259
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,096
Yeah?

260
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,392
All of us?

261
00:30:26,812 --> 00:30:27,939
Come here.

262
00:30:34,113 --> 00:30:35,782
Anybody, that tall.

263
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:40,451
They must've rode all over the territory
to get that many brand-new hats.

264
00:31:42,662 --> 00:31:43,997
You know...

265
00:31:44,332 --> 00:31:48,337
...you're gonna have to feed these kids
till my cook comes.

266
00:31:48,921 --> 00:31:50,173
I don't mind.

267
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:53,009
I like the sound of boys.

268
00:32:28,306 --> 00:32:32,103
Next one of you pulls a knife in this outfit...

269
00:32:32,688 --> 00:32:35,857
...you're gonna learn better
at the buckle end of my belt.

270
00:32:36,901 --> 00:32:38,403
Now, what happened?

271
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,366
You.

272
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:44,704
What went on here?

273
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,873
He said somethin' about his mother.

274
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:49,585
What'd he say?

275
00:32:51,588 --> 00:32:53,132
Your mother is a whore.

276
00:32:53,215 --> 00:32:55,968
- You understand Spanish, Mr. Andersen?
- I understand.

277
00:32:56,052 --> 00:32:57,470
So does Slim.

278
00:32:59,765 --> 00:33:00,808
Clear out.

279
00:33:01,143 --> 00:33:03,228
Get on your horse and clear out.

280
00:33:05,064 --> 00:33:07,358
All right. There's plenty of road.

281
00:33:22,628 --> 00:33:24,297
Give me back my gun.

282
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,303
I'm not in the habit of throwin'
kerosene on a fire.

283
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:30,473
It cost me $30.

284
00:33:31,307 --> 00:33:32,683
Send me a bill.

285
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,438
You're gonna get it, mister.

286
00:33:45,702 --> 00:33:48,372
All right, everybody packin' iron unload it.

287
00:33:48,914 --> 00:33:50,999
Throw it over here in this buggy.

288
00:33:52,001 --> 00:33:54,046
And I mean anything that shoots.

289
00:33:54,129 --> 00:33:57,508
Anybody holds out so much
as a pea-shooter...

290
00:33:57,592 --> 00:34:01,680
...may find himself hangin'
by a tie-rope 70 foot up in a tree.

291
00:34:08,565 --> 00:34:10,526
You ever fire that thing?

292
00:34:11,194 --> 00:34:12,237
No, sir.

293
00:34:14,031 --> 00:34:16,951
This hardware'll be locked up
in the chuck wagon.

294
00:34:17,494 --> 00:34:20,456
You got anything to settle between you,
butt heads.

295
00:34:20,665 --> 00:34:22,583
Now get rid of those bedrolls and...

296
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:25,295
...get mounted and we'll see
how much you don't know.

297
00:34:32,431 --> 00:34:34,266
All right, turn him loose.

298
00:34:45,114 --> 00:34:46,949
Bring in the iron, Charlie.

299
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:57,088
Been smellin' that for 40 years.
Never could get used to it.

300
00:34:57,464 --> 00:34:59,549
- You.
- Yes, sir.

301
00:34:59,633 --> 00:35:02,595
- What's your name?
- Hardy Fimps.

302
00:35:03,472 --> 00:35:04,848
Go rope one.

303
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:24,124
You'll do.

304
00:35:33,345 --> 00:35:36,390
I've seen 'em fight all day,
from dawn to dark.

305
00:35:36,974 --> 00:35:39,811
Sometimes the young one wins,
sometimes the old.

306
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,443
Young one's got more muscle.

307
00:35:45,528 --> 00:35:47,613
Old one's got more experience.

308
00:35:58,211 --> 00:36:00,631
That's the old one still standin' there.

309
00:36:02,843 --> 00:36:05,220
- Keep his nose out of the water.
- Watch out!

310
00:36:05,303 --> 00:36:07,514
Hang on to that line!

311
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:10,102
Steady, steady. Pull!

312
00:36:10,185 --> 00:36:11,770
Slow, Weedy!

313
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:16,276
Watch out for those horns.

314
00:36:16,986 --> 00:36:18,154
You got him.

315
00:36:18,989 --> 00:36:20,699
Now hold him right there.

316
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:24,037
Pull his nose back now.

317
00:36:25,205 --> 00:36:26,749
Keep his head back.

318
00:36:34,384 --> 00:36:36,136
All right, take him out!

319
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:37,722
Pull!

320
00:36:39,892 --> 00:36:41,727
Get him outta there!

321
00:36:42,227 --> 00:36:43,687
You need some help?

322
00:36:45,398 --> 00:36:47,610
Nah, they're doin' all right.

323
00:36:56,206 --> 00:36:57,540
Mr. Wil Andersen?

324
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,417
What can I do for you?

325
00:36:59,542 --> 00:37:02,545
Well, I think there's somethin'
that we can do for each other.

326
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:05,425
My name's Asa Watts. How are ya?

327
00:37:05,927 --> 00:37:08,513
This here's Henry Williams and Red Tucker.

328
00:37:08,846 --> 00:37:10,264
They both ride with me.

329
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:13,686
We heard that you was goin' on a drive,
needin' some hands.

330
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,313
You sure heard right.

331
00:37:15,398 --> 00:37:17,400
Well, sir, we're the very best.

332
00:37:18,401 --> 00:37:20,361
You fellas aren't from around here.

333
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:22,657
No, sir, we're not.
We're from Denton County.

334
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,743
We've been up
on the Ruby River pannin' for gold...

335
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:27,746
...like every other damn fool.

336
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:32,545
These last 22 days, you know, all we got
was $2 worth of dust and nothin' more.

337
00:37:32,629 --> 00:37:34,047
Ain't that pitiful?

338
00:37:34,131 --> 00:37:37,426
Now we're ready to get back
to what we know, and that's cows.

339
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,345
What outfits have you worked with?

340
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:43,350
Well, sir, we've worked for every big outfit
in North Montana. You name 'em.

341
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:44,894
No. You name 'em.

342
00:37:46,188 --> 00:37:49,358
All righty.
There's Oscar West at the Triple-D...

343
00:37:49,693 --> 00:37:52,612
...and George C. Thompson over there
at McNeil...

344
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,949
...Dillard Fant at the Santa Rosa.

345
00:37:55,117 --> 00:37:57,202
How long were you with Fant?

346
00:37:57,453 --> 00:37:59,456
Well, sir, the last eight years.

347
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:02,460
What a lovely old gentleman he is.

348
00:38:02,543 --> 00:38:06,630
If we weren't three of the damnedest fools
you ever saw we'd be there with him now.

349
00:38:06,715 --> 00:38:09,135
And if you were, you'd be in a pine box.

350
00:38:09,344 --> 00:38:10,429
Sir?

351
00:38:10,804 --> 00:38:14,308
I was pallbearer at his funeral
five years ago.

352
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,026
Well, I've been caught at it, haven't I?

353
00:38:21,985 --> 00:38:24,905
Mr. Andersen, I'm sorry. I lied to you.

354
00:38:25,908 --> 00:38:29,620
I got all 'em names right out of
the Stockman's Association Brand Book.

355
00:38:31,373 --> 00:38:33,959
We're fresh out of jail,
the three of us, and...

356
00:38:34,168 --> 00:38:38,090
...I don't know, you tell that to people
and they just turn a deaf ear on ya.

357
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:41,844
Well, I'm afraid I can't use you.

358
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:44,390
How do you mean you can't use us?

359
00:38:44,474 --> 00:38:46,142
I won't use you.

360
00:38:48,604 --> 00:38:52,566
Will you be like everybody else and not
give us a chance to redeem ourselves?

361
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:56,114
I don't hold jail against you,
but I hate a liar.

362
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,412
You're a hard man, Mr. Andersen.

363
00:39:02,163 --> 00:39:04,750
It's a hard life. I got work to do.

364
00:39:04,918 --> 00:39:09,673
Sir, before you get back to your work,
I'd like to ask you one more little question.

365
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:13,053
What are you gonna use for hands
on this drive of yours, huh?

366
00:39:15,223 --> 00:39:17,559
Them little-bitty boys down there?

367
00:39:18,644 --> 00:39:20,271
Come on, you know better than that.

368
00:39:20,354 --> 00:39:23,650
You know what you'll need
to trundle 'em boys across the prairie?

369
00:39:23,734 --> 00:39:24,819
A baby carriage.

370
00:39:24,902 --> 00:39:27,238
Well, whatever I need I'll get.

371
00:39:27,489 --> 00:39:28,740
I bet you will.

372
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:35,332
Good luck to you, Mr. Andersen.

373
00:39:54,275 --> 00:39:55,818
Get mounted!

374
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,515
There's your saddle band.

375
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:54,229
They've been livin' wild all winter.
We'll finish breaking 'em on the drive.

376
00:40:55,523 --> 00:40:58,359
We'll pick our strings by age.
Who's the oldest?

377
00:40:58,485 --> 00:40:59,319
I am.

378
00:40:59,403 --> 00:41:01,114
Get yourself a rope.

379
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:32,405
All right.

380
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,577
And here.

381
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:41,042
May I have some more, please?

382
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:42,126
Sure.

383
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:47,550
You eat that much at home?

384
00:41:48,594 --> 00:41:51,555
We've been branding cattle all day.

385
00:41:54,184 --> 00:41:57,104
Can't be that hungry. They're showin' off.

386
00:42:26,602 --> 00:42:29,355
Good afternoon, mister.
Were you lookin' for me?

387
00:42:30,274 --> 00:42:31,442
Who are you?

388
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,488
Name's Nightlinger. Jebediah Nightlinger.

389
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:37,700
I was expecting a white man.

390
00:42:38,243 --> 00:42:40,245
Jim Wheeler. What happened to him?

391
00:42:40,328 --> 00:42:43,457
Well, he got drunk on Sunday
and married on Monday.

392
00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:45,335
I came in his stead.

393
00:42:45,753 --> 00:42:48,923
I told him the fix I was in.
He promised he wouldn't let me down.

394
00:42:49,007 --> 00:42:52,344
He doesn't even wash his hands
before he puts 'em in the pot.

395
00:42:52,554 --> 00:42:53,597
I do.

396
00:42:54,515 --> 00:42:55,808
Can you cook?

397
00:42:57,518 --> 00:42:58,812
Apple pie.

398
00:42:59,147 --> 00:43:00,815
Green apples sliced thin.

399
00:43:01,274 --> 00:43:04,485
LLard, flour, salt, water to bind.

400
00:43:04,945 --> 00:43:07,615
Sugar, cinnamon, a dab of butter.

401
00:43:08,075 --> 00:43:10,995
Three slashes on the crust, one for steam...

402
00:43:11,078 --> 00:43:13,581
...and two because your momma
did it that way.

403
00:43:13,999 --> 00:43:16,502
Good afternoon to you, lady. Am I correct?

404
00:43:16,752 --> 00:43:18,087
Why, yes, indeed.

405
00:43:18,172 --> 00:43:19,215
Mrs. Andersen.

406
00:43:19,298 --> 00:43:20,341
Ma'am.

407
00:43:21,008 --> 00:43:23,177
You ever been on a trail drive?

408
00:43:23,637 --> 00:43:25,514
The Oregon, Chisholm...

409
00:43:26,015 --> 00:43:28,351
...Santa Fe, some without names.

410
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:29,811
I don't know.

411
00:43:30,229 --> 00:43:32,689
I like to travel with a man I'm used to.

412
00:43:33,441 --> 00:43:35,026
You'll get used to me.

413
00:43:37,864 --> 00:43:39,241
What do you want for wages?

414
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:40,700
All I can get.

415
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,454
This job pays $100.

416
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:44,665
A hundred?

417
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:46,751
That's the money.

418
00:43:46,834 --> 00:43:50,630
Well, if you should get flooded out,
stampeded out, frozen out...

419
00:43:50,881 --> 00:43:52,967
...or scalped by wild red Indians...

420
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:57,347
...there'll always be substantial food
on the plate and coffee on the boil. But...

421
00:43:57,431 --> 00:43:59,559
...that'll cost you $125.

422
00:44:00,352 --> 00:44:03,064
You're a pretty independent character,
aren't ya?

423
00:44:03,816 --> 00:44:05,359
It's been said of me.

424
00:44:09,197 --> 00:44:10,991
Put your wagon in the barn.

425
00:44:12,786 --> 00:44:14,538
Are all these small boys...?

426
00:44:14,621 --> 00:44:18,876
No! They're my trail hands, God help us.

427
00:44:20,589 --> 00:44:23,341
Well, doesn't anything larger
wanna work for you?

428
00:44:23,925 --> 00:44:26,720
We had a case o' gold fever around here.

429
00:44:27,013 --> 00:44:28,681
They're all that's left.

430
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,146
I'll fix up some sugar tits to take along.

431
00:44:34,273 --> 00:44:36,859
Hey, Dan. What's sugar tits?

432
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,287
This one suits me.

433
00:46:11,944 --> 00:46:14,030
Smells of boy in here.

434
00:46:17,826 --> 00:46:19,871
You're staring at me, children!

435
00:46:20,164 --> 00:46:21,957
I feel your eyes on my back.

436
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:24,126
Now why is that?

437
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,254
Well, sir...

438
00:46:26,796 --> 00:46:29,175
...you're the first nigger we ever saw.

439
00:46:29,927 --> 00:46:31,970
Then it must be a treat for you.

440
00:46:32,722 --> 00:46:34,641
Something different for a change.

441
00:46:36,434 --> 00:46:38,103
Are you black all over?

442
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:41,441
Except for the white o' my eyes.

443
00:46:41,984 --> 00:46:44,820
Is your, you know, your...

444
00:46:45,781 --> 00:46:47,951
It is. Black, too.

445
00:46:48,743 --> 00:46:51,788
See? He's the same as us,
except for that color.

446
00:46:53,249 --> 00:46:54,583
The same as you?

447
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:00,926
The same as you!

448
00:47:04,932 --> 00:47:06,642
Oh, children.

449
00:47:07,893 --> 00:47:10,229
My father was a brawny Moor.

450
00:47:10,855 --> 00:47:12,774
Six feet six inches tall.

451
00:47:14,236 --> 00:47:17,990
He bound his head in a red velvet cloth.

452
00:47:20,034 --> 00:47:22,078
He wore a curved sword...

453
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:25,125
...forged from the finest Toledo steel.

454
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:28,545
He captured a lady...

455
00:47:29,255 --> 00:47:31,173
...bright and dark.

456
00:47:32,218 --> 00:47:34,178
He took her in his arms...

457
00:47:34,929 --> 00:47:37,181
...and wrapped her in a warm quilt...

458
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:39,476
...and carried her off.

459
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,482
They came to a castle...

460
00:47:44,943 --> 00:47:48,488
...and he battered down the doors
with the trunk of an oak tree...

461
00:47:48,697 --> 00:47:51,159
...and killed everybody in it!

462
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,830
Just so they could rest the night.

463
00:48:01,131 --> 00:48:02,257
LLater...

464
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,386
...while she slept...

465
00:48:06,971 --> 00:48:09,016
...he walked the parapets...

466
00:48:11,854 --> 00:48:13,397
...and became a king.

467
00:48:16,485 --> 00:48:18,029
Is that true?

468
00:48:19,113 --> 00:48:21,699
If it isn't, it ought to be.

469
00:48:23,827 --> 00:48:25,329
Blow out those lamps!

470
00:48:25,413 --> 00:48:27,375
You, that lamp!

471
00:48:57,665 --> 00:48:58,874
Do your work.

472
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,460
Don't be profane
and don't listen to profanity.

473
00:49:02,672 --> 00:49:04,799
Wash your feet daily.
Say your prayers nightly.

474
00:49:04,924 --> 00:49:05,967
Yes, sir.

475
00:49:06,468 --> 00:49:09,054
You have to go out in the world
and prove yourself.

476
00:49:10,472 --> 00:49:11,975
I guess that's right.

477
00:49:19,067 --> 00:49:20,485
God bless you, son.

478
00:49:24,158 --> 00:49:26,201
- Don't be fresh.
- I won't.

479
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:27,871
And don't come to any harm.

480
00:49:27,996 --> 00:49:29,623
Don't worry, I won't.

481
00:49:36,424 --> 00:49:37,884
So long, Gramps.

482
00:49:51,904 --> 00:49:53,822
Sixty days oughta see me back.

483
00:49:55,658 --> 00:49:57,202
I want two things.

484
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:58,954
What?

485
00:50:00,916 --> 00:50:04,252
You home again
and a string of blue glass beads.

486
00:50:05,505 --> 00:50:07,341
You don't ask for much, Ann.

487
00:50:07,424 --> 00:50:08,842
I don't need much.

488
00:50:09,803 --> 00:50:12,597
Well, if ya run into any trouble, call Anse.

489
00:50:14,976 --> 00:50:17,604
I'll think about ya
before I go to bed at night.

490
00:50:19,315 --> 00:50:21,317
You do and you won't sleep.

491
00:51:07,503 --> 00:51:10,758
- Are you ready, Mr. Nightlinger?
- LLong ready, Mr. Andersen.

492
00:51:10,842 --> 00:51:12,510
LLet's go to Belle Fourche.

493
00:51:15,681 --> 00:51:17,099
Move 'em out!

494
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:19,978
Yes, sir! Move 'em out, Weedy!

495
00:51:20,605 --> 00:51:22,065
Start 'em, Charlie!

496
00:51:22,358 --> 00:51:23,776
Move 'em out, Bob!

497
00:51:24,068 --> 00:51:25,903
Move 'em, Jim!

498
00:52:09,169 --> 00:52:11,296
All right, don't move 'em over here.

499
00:52:11,422 --> 00:52:13,090
Keep 'em over this way!

500
00:52:40,878 --> 00:52:42,255
That's good, Slim.

501
00:52:44,425 --> 00:52:45,926
Right pace, Homer.

502
00:52:46,802 --> 00:52:49,305
Any faster you'd be runnin' tallow
off of 'em.

503
00:52:49,389 --> 00:52:51,351
That's money out of my pocket.

504
00:52:59,653 --> 00:53:01,947
We'll try and make Still Meadows tonight.

505
00:53:02,032 --> 00:53:03,283
Still Meadows.

506
00:53:24,143 --> 00:53:27,147
All right, take 'em through.
Take 'em through. Come on!

507
00:53:28,858 --> 00:53:31,027
Get with it! Head 'em down there!

508
00:53:31,237 --> 00:53:32,863
Head 'em downhill!

509
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:35,617
Get up there, kid. Get up where you were!

510
00:53:39,456 --> 00:53:40,999
Get down, Hardy!

511
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:44,253
Hey, there's a stray.
You want me to get him?

512
00:53:45,506 --> 00:53:48,509
Easy, easy! Don't stop, go with 'em!

513
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:50,178
Go with 'em!

514
00:53:52,432 --> 00:53:54,101
Go on with the wagon!

515
00:53:55,144 --> 00:53:57,855
Easy, easy. Don't stop 'em.

516
00:53:58,314 --> 00:54:00,024
Go with 'em! Go with 'em!

517
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,679
You were sleepin'.

518
00:54:23,682 --> 00:54:25,350
I'm sorry, Mr. Andersen.

519
00:54:25,768 --> 00:54:29,813
I pay a full day's wages,
and expect a full day's work.

520
00:55:02,525 --> 00:55:04,944
Drove you hard today, didn't he, children?

521
00:55:17,169 --> 00:55:20,339
- You think it's gonna be like this everyday?
- Yep.

522
00:55:21,091 --> 00:55:22,384
Sundays, too?

523
00:55:22,467 --> 00:55:24,804
There ain't no Sundays west of Omaha.

524
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:28,058
Slim, give that to Hardy.

525
00:55:30,186 --> 00:55:31,688
Watch it, it's hot.

526
00:55:34,943 --> 00:55:36,653
I never noticed before...

527
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:41,534
...but most of the people I know
are quiet compared to Mr. Andersen.

528
00:55:42,202 --> 00:55:45,206
He's quiet, it just comes out loud.

529
00:56:22,507 --> 00:56:24,592
That youngster's been following all day.

530
00:56:24,675 --> 00:56:25,718
I know it.

531
00:56:26,595 --> 00:56:27,679
Who is he?

532
00:56:29,641 --> 00:56:31,309
A burr under my hide.

533
00:56:31,435 --> 00:56:33,729
You just gonna leave him out there?

534
00:56:34,438 --> 00:56:38,610
Mr. Nightlinger, you take care
of the kitchen, I'll take care of the drive.

535
00:56:45,078 --> 00:56:48,582
You know, in the late war
between the states...

536
00:56:49,334 --> 00:56:51,503
...I served under an officer...

537
00:56:52,003 --> 00:56:53,839
...just like you.

538
00:56:55,676 --> 00:56:57,010
Is that right?

539
00:56:57,469 --> 00:57:01,348
As a matter of fact, I shot
that military gentleman in the buttocks...

540
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,476
...just outside of Vicksburg.

541
00:57:04,145 --> 00:57:05,647
I'd have hung ya.

542
00:57:06,565 --> 00:57:08,525
They gave me a medal.

543
00:57:10,778 --> 00:57:13,156
In my regiment, Mr. Nightlinger...

544
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:16,286
...I was known as Old Iron Pants.

545
00:57:16,996 --> 00:57:18,789
You might keep that in mind.

546
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:31,847
Rise and shine! Rise and shine!

547
00:57:32,224 --> 00:57:34,226
Hey, Hardy, you wake up!

548
00:57:34,769 --> 00:57:37,939
Homer! Get up and go wake up
good Slim over there!

549
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,733
Up, up, up!

550
00:57:40,026 --> 00:57:42,488
Out of these sacks, into your britches!

551
00:57:42,571 --> 00:57:44,698
Come on, Jim, get up! Get up!

552
00:57:45,366 --> 00:57:47,368
My God, get up!

553
00:57:47,535 --> 00:57:49,370
Don't let the sun catch ya sleepin'.

554
00:57:49,455 --> 00:57:51,583
Mr. Nightlinger, what's for breakfast?

555
00:57:51,666 --> 00:57:53,710
Stewed apples, bacon and biscuits.

556
00:57:53,795 --> 00:57:55,338
Well, forget the apples.

557
00:57:55,421 --> 00:57:58,049
Slap some bacon on a biscuit and let's go!

558
00:57:58,175 --> 00:57:59,803
We're burnin' daylight!

559
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,930
Burnin' daylight?

560
00:58:02,681 --> 00:58:03,974
All I see are stars.

561
00:58:04,058 --> 00:58:06,477
You'll see a lot more of 'em
if you don't move it.

562
00:58:12,569 --> 00:58:13,779
Bring 'em on!

563
00:58:15,365 --> 00:58:17,785
Bring 'em on, Mr. Nightlinger!

564
00:58:32,554 --> 00:58:35,598
Go on. Stay with 'em. Keep 'em upriver.

565
00:58:36,893 --> 00:58:40,438
Stay upriver, Mr. Nightlinger,
there's some soft sand down there.

566
00:58:41,774 --> 00:58:45,112
Keep 'em upriver,
and let 'em go higher up their heads.

567
00:58:57,588 --> 00:58:59,047
Well, come on.

568
00:59:15,403 --> 00:59:18,281
Keep 'em upstream
so they won't have to swim.

569
00:59:30,172 --> 00:59:31,925
Push 'em upstream, that's it.

570
00:59:32,009 --> 00:59:33,093
Good work.

571
00:59:38,099 --> 00:59:39,977
Head 'em upstream more.

572
00:59:48,404 --> 00:59:51,408
Hold 'em up in the canyon
till they all get across.

573
01:00:09,225 --> 01:00:10,643
Help! Help!

574
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,761
Come on.

575
01:00:37,304 --> 01:00:39,055
Here's one of your strays.

576
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,809
You all right?

577
01:00:43,729 --> 01:00:47,274
Better sit on his back and pump him out.

578
01:00:48,943 --> 01:00:49,944
Get his feet up.

579
01:00:50,696 --> 01:00:52,449
Move your gear into camp.

580
01:00:54,035 --> 01:00:56,871
I won't charge you for the days
I've been following you.

581
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:59,582
You're hired on, just like the rest.

582
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:01,210
You work out, you stay.

583
01:01:01,294 --> 01:01:03,671
If you don't, it's a long walk back.

584
01:01:05,799 --> 01:01:06,967
You!

585
01:01:13,852 --> 01:01:16,188
You almost got him killed, you know that?

586
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:18,983
- But I tried to tell you.
- The hell you did!

587
01:01:19,317 --> 01:01:20,486
I tried hard.

588
01:01:20,569 --> 01:01:23,572
If you'd have been out in that water
we'd have heard you.

589
01:01:23,657 --> 01:01:25,534
I couldn't get the words out.

590
01:01:25,618 --> 01:01:29,122
You could've if you'd wanted to.
You just didn't want to bad enough.

591
01:01:29,206 --> 01:01:30,874
Before God, I tried.

592
01:01:30,959 --> 01:01:32,669
Tryin' don't get it done!

593
01:01:32,752 --> 01:01:36,673
The fact is, you almost let your friend
choke to death out in that river.

594
01:01:36,757 --> 01:01:39,678
- I'd rather die than done that.
- Then you're a liar!

595
01:01:40,721 --> 01:01:42,598
It ain't my fault I stutter.

596
01:01:42,682 --> 01:01:45,017
LListen to me, you whinin' little whelp...

597
01:01:45,102 --> 01:01:47,772
...you'll stop stutterin'
or get the hell out of here.

598
01:01:47,855 --> 01:01:50,233
You're gonna stop it or go home,
do you hear me?

599
01:01:51,694 --> 01:01:53,112
You son of a bitch.

600
01:01:53,864 --> 01:01:55,031
What did you say?

601
01:01:55,115 --> 01:01:58,119
- You goddamn son of a bitch!
- Say that again.

602
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:00,914
- You goddamn, mean son of a bitch!
- Say it faster!

603
01:02:00,998 --> 01:02:03,792
You goddamn, mean, dirty son of a bitch!

604
01:02:05,379 --> 01:02:08,340
I wouldn't make it a habit
callin' me that, son.

605
01:02:13,055 --> 01:02:14,391
I did it.

606
01:02:15,393 --> 01:02:16,895
Did ya hear me?

607
01:02:17,145 --> 01:02:18,271
I did it.

608
01:02:19,397 --> 01:02:20,607
I did it.

609
01:02:37,755 --> 01:02:39,048
Hey, Cimarron.

610
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,100
I ain't had a chance to thank you
for haulin' me out.

611
01:02:47,185 --> 01:02:48,519
I sure am obliged.

612
01:02:49,938 --> 01:02:52,483
- Well, I figure I owe you for it.
- Yeah?

613
01:02:53,401 --> 01:02:54,861
How much in dollars?

614
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:59,492
Well, I can't pay you in dollars.
I ain't got any dollars.

615
01:02:59,618 --> 01:03:01,828
Well, money's what cuts it with me.

616
01:03:04,082 --> 01:03:05,541
Hey, wait a minute.

617
01:03:15,931 --> 01:03:17,683
I picked this up on the trail.

618
01:03:18,142 --> 01:03:21,938
I know it ain't gold, it's just fool's gold,
but it's kinda pretty.

619
01:03:23,817 --> 01:03:25,402
You callin' me a fool?

620
01:03:25,569 --> 01:03:27,905
No, no, I didn't mean it like that.

621
01:03:40,213 --> 01:03:41,715
I got no use for it.

622
01:03:54,649 --> 01:03:56,443
You write that yourself?

623
01:03:56,652 --> 01:04:00,114
No, no. It's printed on paper.
I've been tryin' to learn it.

624
01:04:02,075 --> 01:04:04,913
Well, there's nothin' to it.
It's just like arithmetic.

625
01:04:04,997 --> 01:04:06,290
All you gotta do is just...

626
01:04:06,373 --> 01:04:09,460
...count lines and spaces.
That tells you where the notes go.

627
01:04:09,544 --> 01:04:11,046
It ain't hard.

628
01:04:13,342 --> 01:04:15,177
LLooks like fly specks to me.

629
01:04:16,136 --> 01:04:18,221
Some guy named Vivaldi wrote it.

630
01:04:20,475 --> 01:04:21,852
It's kinda pretty.

631
01:04:33,576 --> 01:04:36,996
If that's that ol' Tennessee sour mash,
put a little in there.

632
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,919
Good for my rheumatism.

633
01:04:41,254 --> 01:04:42,922
That comes with old age.

634
01:04:43,047 --> 01:04:45,341
Yeah, miserable old age.

635
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:46,843
I hate it.

636
01:04:47,469 --> 01:04:50,223
I'm not far behind you
and I don't like it, either.

637
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,229
My oldest boy...

638
01:04:57,357 --> 01:05:00,111
...would be close to 40 now. Middle-aged.

639
01:05:01,029 --> 01:05:02,614
If he had lived.

640
01:05:02,739 --> 01:05:04,241
You lost a son?

641
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:06,327
Two of 'em.

642
01:05:07,664 --> 01:05:09,124
Went bad on me.

643
01:05:11,334 --> 01:05:13,211
Or I went bad on them.

644
01:05:13,671 --> 01:05:14,922
I don't know.

645
01:05:15,298 --> 01:05:17,009
I can't figure it out.

646
01:05:17,594 --> 01:05:19,429
You got another chance.

647
01:05:21,807 --> 01:05:23,225
They're not mine.

648
01:05:24,476 --> 01:05:25,770
They could be.

649
01:06:29,856 --> 01:06:32,901
So as I went down to Denver
with my cousin, LL.D. Grimes...

650
01:06:32,985 --> 01:06:35,570
...then there was
a hootchy-kootchy show goin' on.

651
01:06:35,655 --> 01:06:38,450
When the fella wasn't lookin'
we snuck in under the tent.

652
01:06:38,535 --> 01:06:41,663
There was this gal up on the stage
doin' a harem dance.

653
01:06:42,706 --> 01:06:45,500
First thing I know,
she dropped her dress and was naked.

654
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:47,879
- All over?
- From head to toe.

655
01:06:48,298 --> 01:06:49,841
What'd she look like?

656
01:06:50,091 --> 01:06:53,970
She had a belly button so big,
you could've stuck your middle finger in it.

657
01:06:54,054 --> 01:06:57,684
I saw my first one in Benbow, too.
Fifty years ago.

658
01:06:58,644 --> 01:07:00,271
Probably the same girl.

659
01:07:03,525 --> 01:07:05,695
Damned if he ain't almost human today.

660
01:07:06,238 --> 01:07:09,158
He's been sleepin' better.
He's been at the bottle.

661
01:07:09,366 --> 01:07:10,993
You mean there's bug juice in camp?

662
01:07:11,077 --> 01:07:14,582
I seen him and Mr. Nightlinger
swillin' it down last night.

663
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:16,835
Keeps it in a drawer in the chuck wagon.

664
01:07:16,918 --> 01:07:18,378
Which drawer?

665
01:07:36,277 --> 01:07:38,029
Come on. Hurry up. Give me that.

666
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:42,410
Come on, let's go. Hurry up.

667
01:07:46,917 --> 01:07:47,793
Come on, Weedy.

668
01:07:47,876 --> 01:07:49,586
Weedy, come on.

669
01:07:50,212 --> 01:07:51,673
Hurry up. Everybody else is.

670
01:07:51,882 --> 01:07:54,176
- You're wasting time.
- Gambling's a sin.

671
01:07:54,259 --> 01:07:56,720
- So what?
- This ain't gamblin', it's stealin'.

672
01:07:56,846 --> 01:07:59,182
- That's a bigger sin.
- Not if you don't get caught.

673
01:07:59,265 --> 01:08:02,103
- Come on, just take one.
- Come on, Weedy, come on.

674
01:08:05,858 --> 01:08:07,610
Holy shit!

675
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,406
Go on, Weedy, go on. Hurry up.

676
01:08:10,615 --> 01:08:12,367
Watch out! Here he comes.

677
01:08:24,591 --> 01:08:27,512
Innocence is wasted on me.
I don't believe in it.

678
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:29,348
What are you up to?

679
01:08:30,891 --> 01:08:32,601
Nothin', Mr. Nightlinger.

680
01:08:33,562 --> 01:08:34,855
Nothin' at all.

681
01:08:35,772 --> 01:08:38,568
Boys are always guilty of something nasty.

682
01:08:39,778 --> 01:08:42,072
What could it be this time, I wonder?

683
01:08:42,532 --> 01:08:45,703
Nothin', I swear. Just standin' here talkin'.

684
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:48,665
If you're lying, remember one thing:

685
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:52,712
I could swallow each of you whole,
without choking.

686
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:57,259
All I need to do is butter your heads
and pin your ears back.

687
01:09:09,943 --> 01:09:11,487
Hey, come on.

688
01:09:16,035 --> 01:09:17,161
Hurry up.

689
01:09:17,245 --> 01:09:18,872
Get goin'. Go, go.

690
01:09:19,581 --> 01:09:21,375
Keep goin'.

691
01:09:24,254 --> 01:09:27,257
LLook in with the liniment.
That's where my folks keep it.

692
01:09:30,178 --> 01:09:31,722
- Hurry up.
- Come on.

693
01:09:32,891 --> 01:09:35,352
Come on, Weedy,
don't take your sweet time.

694
01:09:35,436 --> 01:09:37,480
- Come on. Come on.
- Hurry up.

695
01:09:37,563 --> 01:09:39,315
Hurry up, Weedy.

696
01:09:39,859 --> 01:09:41,569
- Come on.
- It's not here.

697
01:09:41,653 --> 01:09:43,571
- LLook around here.
- LLook over here.

698
01:09:44,949 --> 01:09:46,242
Hurry up.

699
01:09:46,575 --> 01:09:49,204
- Would you get goin'? We'll watch.
- Go on.

700
01:09:54,461 --> 01:09:55,629
I got it.

701
01:09:57,339 --> 01:09:59,551
Don't drop it.

702
01:10:05,559 --> 01:10:07,687
- Hot coffee.
- Heard ya comin'.

703
01:10:07,896 --> 01:10:09,023
I'm used.

704
01:10:16,073 --> 01:10:17,409
That Fats!

705
01:10:18,744 --> 01:10:21,204
He can sure sing those cows to sleep.

706
01:10:24,625 --> 01:10:27,254
Fat boy isn't on guard. He was just here.

707
01:10:27,881 --> 01:10:29,466
That's right. It's...

708
01:10:30,551 --> 01:10:32,136
...Steve and Cimarron.

709
01:10:35,308 --> 01:10:37,143
There's more than one voice.

710
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:58,046
What is this?

711
01:11:34,052 --> 01:11:36,722
Weedy! You keep takin'
long swigs like that...

712
01:11:36,805 --> 01:11:38,975
...you're gonna miss your turn next time.

713
01:11:39,059 --> 01:11:40,185
Pass it on.

714
01:11:41,645 --> 01:11:44,189
Hey! There's two of everybody.

715
01:11:49,239 --> 01:11:50,866
There's two moons.

716
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,787
I'm going to bed as soon as I can stand up.

717
01:11:55,664 --> 01:11:57,751
Just don't wake up OI' Iron Nuts.

718
01:11:59,836 --> 01:12:03,965
Mr. Brass Ass Andersen.
A bastard if there ever was one.

719
01:12:04,467 --> 01:12:07,679
He made you stop stutterin' fast.
He really tromped your tail!

720
01:12:07,764 --> 01:12:08,806
LListen, Fatso...

721
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:11,684
I could have given up stutterin'
a long time ago.

722
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:14,773
- Why didn't ya?
- I didn't know anybody wanted me to.

723
01:12:18,235 --> 01:12:20,863
This is the first time I've ever been drunk.

724
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:24,786
Oh, you gettin' sick, ya farmer?

725
01:12:27,499 --> 01:12:29,250
- I've decided.
- What?

726
01:12:29,876 --> 01:12:34,507
I've decided if OI' Iron Nuts tells me
I'm burnin' daylight just one more time...

727
01:12:34,633 --> 01:12:36,468
...I'm gonna let him have it.

728
01:12:37,595 --> 01:12:38,971
Have what?

729
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:40,890
It.

730
01:12:41,183 --> 01:12:42,811
What's it?

731
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:47,399
I ain't decided yet.

732
01:12:48,609 --> 01:12:50,194
What happened to that bottle?

733
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,739
It's coming.

734
01:12:53,658 --> 01:12:57,286
You know who you sounded like just then?
Mr. Nightlinger.

735
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:01,960
That black son of a bitch
cooks better than my ma.

736
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:06,215
Come on, you, we oughta be goin'
before the old man finds out we're gone.

737
01:13:09,012 --> 01:13:10,472
Yeah, come on.

738
01:13:11,348 --> 01:13:14,476
Did ya ever notice how pink
Mr. Nightlinger's palms are?

739
01:13:14,727 --> 01:13:16,271
They're kinda pretty.

740
01:13:17,398 --> 01:13:18,608
Shit.

741
01:13:19,109 --> 01:13:20,402
Shit yourself.

742
01:13:31,083 --> 01:13:33,294
Shall we join 'em, Mr. Nightlinger?

743
01:13:42,222 --> 01:13:44,475
When did you take your first drink?

744
01:13:46,896 --> 01:13:49,774
It was on the occasion
of my first broken heart.

745
01:13:50,484 --> 01:13:51,735
And my last.

746
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,907
She was an older woman and wise.

747
01:13:56,492 --> 01:13:58,035
Vastly experienced.

748
01:13:59,537 --> 01:14:02,957
She told me she couldn't stand
the sight of me for another minute...

749
01:14:03,042 --> 01:14:06,046
...handed me a half-gallon jug
of sour mash and fled.

750
01:14:06,505 --> 01:14:08,131
And you polished it off?

751
01:14:08,382 --> 01:14:09,509
Every drop.

752
01:14:10,843 --> 01:14:13,180
I've been drinking sour mash ever since.

753
01:14:14,933 --> 01:14:16,351
I was 17.

754
01:14:18,145 --> 01:14:19,897
She was almost 22.

755
01:14:21,066 --> 01:14:22,276
Her name...

756
01:14:23,945 --> 01:14:25,363
...was Oceola.

757
01:14:27,449 --> 01:14:29,952
I think these kids are rushin' it a little.

758
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:32,289
They're in a hurry to grow up.

759
01:14:33,582 --> 01:14:35,626
Well, they won't get it out of a bottle.

760
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:37,546
They'll know that in the morning.

761
01:14:47,267 --> 01:14:49,228
All down sick at once.

762
01:14:50,772 --> 01:14:52,774
Must've passed a bad waterhole.

763
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:55,570
Well, this'll settle you.

764
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,530
Come on, son.

765
01:14:57,865 --> 01:14:59,451
Back, wide.

766
01:15:00,827 --> 01:15:01,870
Voila.

767
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,748
Good morning, gentlemen.

768
01:15:05,416 --> 01:15:08,920
Mr. Nightlinger, I'd like some beans
and cabbage for supper...

769
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:12,425
...with a big chunk of fatback
in some red pepper sauce.

770
01:15:13,093 --> 01:15:15,637
And make some gravy out of the grease.

771
01:15:15,847 --> 01:15:17,183
I'll be back.

772
01:15:19,059 --> 01:15:21,312
Hurry it up. We're burnin' daylight.

773
01:15:21,605 --> 01:15:23,565
All right, son, tongue out.

774
01:15:23,982 --> 01:15:25,150
Head back.

775
01:15:25,986 --> 01:15:27,029
Wider.

776
01:15:33,412 --> 01:15:35,499
Where do you think you're goin'?

777
01:15:35,582 --> 01:15:36,958
Go get him, Dan.

778
01:15:37,919 --> 01:15:39,754
Come back, you.

779
01:16:12,965 --> 01:16:15,425
You ain't nothin' but a small child.

780
01:16:15,927 --> 01:16:18,429
If you was a fish, I'd throw you back.

781
01:16:18,638 --> 01:16:20,599
Hey, boys! LLook here!

782
01:16:22,185 --> 01:16:23,562
LLook what I found.

783
01:16:24,814 --> 01:16:26,732
LLook around and meet the boys.

784
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,278
It looks like he surprised us.

785
01:16:29,362 --> 01:16:31,823
We surprised you, too, though,
didn't we, boy?

786
01:16:31,906 --> 01:16:34,492
You know better than to scream out now,
don't ya?

787
01:16:36,537 --> 01:16:38,582
What's the matter with you, son?

788
01:16:39,167 --> 01:16:41,752
You're lookin' at me like I had two heads.

789
01:16:45,507 --> 01:16:48,136
You're wonderin' where I came from,
ain't ya?

790
01:16:51,224 --> 01:16:53,727
You know we've been trackin' ya for days?

791
01:16:54,769 --> 01:16:56,856
What have you got to say to that?

792
01:16:57,399 --> 01:16:58,567
I can't hear you, son.

793
01:16:58,650 --> 01:17:00,235
I can't hear you, son!

794
01:17:00,445 --> 01:17:01,946
I won't say nothin'.

795
01:17:04,241 --> 01:17:05,785
You're a quiet boy.

796
01:17:06,786 --> 01:17:09,289
If I had a prize I'd give it to you, boy.

797
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:11,959
I like quiet boys.

798
01:17:13,002 --> 01:17:14,630
Now, quiet boy...

799
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:16,841
...I'm gonna let you loose.

800
01:17:18,135 --> 01:17:20,262
But, you point your ears now, son.

801
01:17:21,972 --> 01:17:25,894
You won't run back to Mr. Andersen
with them eyes rollin' back in your head...

802
01:17:25,978 --> 01:17:29,565
...tellin' him that these bad men
have been followin' us day and night.

803
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:30,901
You're not gonna say that.

804
01:17:30,984 --> 01:17:34,072
You think you'll raise a commotion
and get congratulated for it.

805
01:17:34,156 --> 01:17:37,409
They'll pat your head
and tell you what a good boy you've been.

806
01:17:37,494 --> 01:17:39,704
That's not gonna do you any good, son.

807
01:17:40,456 --> 01:17:41,874
You know why?

808
01:17:42,334 --> 01:17:44,878
Now you listen to me careful, boy.
You know why?

809
01:17:45,505 --> 01:17:48,716
Because I'm gonna come to you
some night when it's real dark.

810
01:17:49,008 --> 01:17:51,679
I'm gonna come to you on tiptoe...

811
01:17:52,764 --> 01:17:55,517
...so you ain't never gonna be able
to hear me.

812
01:17:56,185 --> 01:17:58,813
And I'm gonna come to you with a knife...

813
01:17:58,897 --> 01:18:01,192
...freshly sharpened on a stone...

814
01:18:02,987 --> 01:18:06,532
...and I'm gonna cut you a grin
down here on your neck.

815
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:09,828
It's gonna run clear across to there.

816
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,377
Do I make myself clear, boy?

817
01:18:15,586 --> 01:18:18,005
Do I make myself clear, boy?

818
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:29,188
Is it clear to ya now? Huh?

819
01:18:31,858 --> 01:18:33,443
Is it clear to ya?

820
01:18:36,071 --> 01:18:38,033
- Is it clear?
- Yes, it's clear.

821
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,085
Go home!

822
01:21:35,184 --> 01:21:37,020
No. No, I ain't gonna.

823
01:21:37,104 --> 01:21:39,399
- You gotta stand watch.
- I ain't gonna.

824
01:21:39,524 --> 01:21:41,526
- It's your turn.
- I ain't gonna.

825
01:21:41,652 --> 01:21:42,737
Why not?

826
01:21:43,446 --> 01:21:44,822
I ain't gonna.

827
01:21:51,498 --> 01:21:54,752
- What's the matter, Dan?
- Nothin'. Just, just leave me alone.

828
01:21:55,378 --> 01:21:57,506
Mr. Andersen, can I speak to you?

829
01:21:58,926 --> 01:22:00,010
Go ahead.

830
01:22:00,677 --> 01:22:02,512
Well, it's about Dan.

831
01:22:03,013 --> 01:22:04,306
What about him?

832
01:22:06,185 --> 01:22:08,354
He doesn't want to stand his watch.

833
01:22:08,939 --> 01:22:11,066
- Is he sick?
- No, sir.

834
01:22:11,316 --> 01:22:13,276
Well, did he break something?

835
01:22:13,444 --> 01:22:14,612
No, sir.

836
01:22:15,072 --> 01:22:17,032
To tell you the truth...

837
01:22:17,116 --> 01:22:19,327
...I think he's afraid of the dark.

838
01:22:31,635 --> 01:22:32,803
Come here.

839
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:41,439
What ails you, boy?

840
01:22:43,234 --> 01:22:44,277
Nothin'.

841
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:47,489
- You nighthawked last night.
- Yes, sir.

842
01:22:47,656 --> 01:22:49,866
- Everything went smooth.
- Yes, sir.

843
01:22:50,535 --> 01:22:53,956
If you don't stand your watch,
somebody goes short of sleep.

844
01:22:54,416 --> 01:22:56,167
Carry your weight, boy.

845
01:22:59,964 --> 01:23:01,049
Yes, sir.

846
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:36,011
I don't steal off you and you don't off me,
not even a pinch of pie.

847
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:37,640
What the matter with you?

848
01:23:37,723 --> 01:23:40,643
Your house is your house
and my house is my house.

849
01:23:40,727 --> 01:23:44,189
Mr. Nightlinger, you'd better start
bein' real careful.

850
01:23:44,315 --> 01:23:46,485
How does it feel to be scared?

851
01:23:50,865 --> 01:23:53,534
You think I was too rough on the boy,
is that it?

852
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:55,372
Yeah, that's it.

853
01:24:03,215 --> 01:24:06,761
Well, I can't say I always decide right.

854
01:24:07,388 --> 01:24:08,806
In that case...

855
01:24:10,684 --> 01:24:12,686
...cut yourself a piece of pie.

856
01:24:26,204 --> 01:24:28,415
Move easy. They're kinda jumpy.

857
01:25:24,657 --> 01:25:27,118
They look funny from up here, don't they?

858
01:25:32,334 --> 01:25:33,877
My glasses!

859
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:38,842
I'll get 'em for ya.

860
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:42,638
- Be careful, Charlie.
- Don't worry, I'll be all right.

861
01:25:45,894 --> 01:25:47,729
Come on, come on.

862
01:25:50,191 --> 01:25:51,526
Easy, boy.

863
01:25:53,195 --> 01:25:54,780
Easy, easy.

864
01:25:57,325 --> 01:25:58,827
Come on, boy, come on.

865
01:25:58,910 --> 01:26:00,370
Come on, easy.

866
01:26:00,538 --> 01:26:02,541
Easy, boy. Easy, boy.

867
01:26:02,791 --> 01:26:04,418
Come on, easy.

868
01:26:06,629 --> 01:26:08,256
Be real careful, Charlie.

869
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:09,675
Don't worry.

870
01:26:11,886 --> 01:26:12,929
Get off him easy.

871
01:26:13,014 --> 01:26:14,432
Just stop worryin'.

872
01:26:23,318 --> 01:26:24,778
I found 'em!

873
01:26:24,945 --> 01:26:27,239
Come on up. Hurry out of there.

874
01:26:39,423 --> 01:26:41,842
Easy, Charlie, don't spook 'em.

875
01:26:46,265 --> 01:26:47,851
They're crowdin' me!

876
01:26:55,152 --> 01:26:56,779
Charlie!

877
01:27:18,725 --> 01:27:20,185
Sometimes, it's...

878
01:27:21,854 --> 01:27:23,523
...hard to understand...

879
01:27:25,067 --> 01:27:26,694
...the drift of things.

880
01:27:28,154 --> 01:27:29,948
This was a good boy.

881
01:27:31,409 --> 01:27:33,160
He'd have been a good man.

882
01:27:33,995 --> 01:27:35,622
Didn't get his chance.

883
01:27:38,418 --> 01:27:41,337
Death can come for you anyplace...

884
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:43,883
...anytime.

885
01:27:45,302 --> 01:27:47,012
It's never welcome, but...

886
01:27:48,515 --> 01:27:50,684
...if you've done all you can do...

887
01:27:52,061 --> 01:27:53,771
...and it's your best...

888
01:27:56,316 --> 01:27:59,153
...in a way, I guess, you're ready for him.

889
01:28:05,287 --> 01:28:06,747
Go on back to camp.

890
01:28:07,832 --> 01:28:09,042
All of you.

891
01:28:38,665 --> 01:28:39,875
Go on, son.

892
01:29:45,462 --> 01:29:46,671
What's that?

893
01:29:48,591 --> 01:29:50,093
LLittle Big Horn.

894
01:29:51,971 --> 01:29:54,348
They didn't even dig him a decent grave.

895
01:29:54,849 --> 01:29:57,143
Well, it's not how you're buried...

896
01:29:57,978 --> 01:29:59,939
...it's how they remember ya.

897
01:30:00,483 --> 01:30:03,194
I guess I better go into Fort Smith and...

898
01:30:03,694 --> 01:30:06,530
...see if there's been any Sioux activity
up ahead.

899
01:30:08,367 --> 01:30:11,913
Keep the cattle headed due east.
Tell Mr. Nightlinger he's in charge.

900
01:30:11,997 --> 01:30:13,957
Why not put me in charge?

901
01:30:14,876 --> 01:30:17,213
Big mouth don't make a big man.

902
01:30:40,369 --> 01:30:42,704
Cimarron, come here!

903
01:30:57,891 --> 01:30:59,977
Them ladies ain't got their dresses on.

904
01:31:00,061 --> 01:31:01,396
No, they ain't.

905
01:31:01,521 --> 01:31:03,983
They sure are pretty.
Wonder who they are?

906
01:31:04,109 --> 01:31:06,445
I don't know. LLet's go find out, huh?

907
01:31:09,282 --> 01:31:12,286
Girls, come on. Come on.

908
01:31:12,454 --> 01:31:14,539
Hurry up. Hurry up, get behind the wagon.

909
01:31:14,622 --> 01:31:15,999
Move, move.

910
01:31:22,675 --> 01:31:24,760
- 'Morning, boys.
- Ma'am.

911
01:31:24,927 --> 01:31:26,762
'Morning, ma'am.

912
01:31:27,723 --> 01:31:29,308
Fine morning, isn't it?

913
01:31:30,101 --> 01:31:31,352
You on a drive?

914
01:31:31,479 --> 01:31:33,939
Yes, ma'am, we're goin' to Belle Fourche.

915
01:31:34,775 --> 01:31:36,359
Where's your headman?

916
01:31:36,443 --> 01:31:39,280
That's Mr. Andersen.
He's over at Fort Smith.

917
01:31:40,824 --> 01:31:42,159
All right, then.

918
01:31:42,659 --> 01:31:44,036
What's your name?

919
01:31:44,621 --> 01:31:46,164
They call me Cimarron.

920
01:31:47,457 --> 01:31:49,376
I'm Kate to my friends.

921
01:31:52,214 --> 01:31:55,175
And who's the one
with the pretty pink blush?

922
01:31:55,968 --> 01:31:57,638
This here's Homer.

923
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:00,225
Hello, Homer.

924
01:32:00,475 --> 01:32:01,601
Ma'am.

925
01:32:02,895 --> 01:32:05,981
How many men you got in your outfit,
Cimarron?

926
01:32:07,985 --> 01:32:11,823
If you're going by age,
we've got two that's 15.

927
01:32:12,241 --> 01:32:13,450
My God!

928
01:32:16,038 --> 01:32:18,999
If you're going by what we can do,
there's 11 of us.

929
01:32:19,166 --> 01:32:20,417
No offense.

930
01:32:21,002 --> 01:32:24,465
In this kind of country
a poor helpless woman likes to know...

931
01:32:24,549 --> 01:32:26,509
...if there are any men around.

932
01:32:27,678 --> 01:32:30,931
Men who can take care of us
as we go along our way.

933
01:32:31,641 --> 01:32:34,019
Well, we're gettin' paid a man's wages.

934
01:32:34,855 --> 01:32:37,691
And you look man enough
to earn them too, Cimarron.

935
01:32:38,317 --> 01:32:41,070
Did you want me for anything,
Mrs. Collingwood?

936
01:32:44,033 --> 01:32:45,368
That's Phoebe.

937
01:32:46,452 --> 01:32:49,998
You're putting too much merchandise
on display, Phoebe.

938
01:32:50,541 --> 01:32:54,337
You better cover some of that up
before you come down with pneumonia.

939
01:32:54,547 --> 01:32:57,383
Isn't this a sweet-lookin' boy?

940
01:33:00,512 --> 01:33:03,016
Wouldn't you like to come inside, honey?

941
01:33:03,142 --> 01:33:06,270
You'd be surprised how nice
we got everything fixed up.

942
01:33:13,363 --> 01:33:16,992
I think that Homer
just saved himself a dollar.

943
01:33:24,253 --> 01:33:25,755
That leaves you.

944
01:33:27,256 --> 01:33:29,635
Well, excuse me for sayin' so, ma'am.

945
01:33:32,430 --> 01:33:34,724
You're old enough to be my momma.

946
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:39,272
Well, if I were, I'd teach you something.

947
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:42,235
LLike what?

948
01:33:43,070 --> 01:33:45,113
LLike manners, for a start.

949
01:33:55,754 --> 01:33:57,172
'Morning, ma'am.

950
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:04,765
Will you see the boys return to work
while I chat with this lady?

951
01:34:05,225 --> 01:34:06,393
Ma'am.

952
01:34:13,945 --> 01:34:15,864
My name's Nightlinger...

953
01:34:16,114 --> 01:34:18,032
...and I'm in charge of these boys.

954
01:34:18,117 --> 01:34:20,661
I'm Mrs. Collingwood and...

955
01:34:21,203 --> 01:34:23,123
...I'm in charge of these girls.

956
01:34:23,207 --> 01:34:26,294
Well, I just heard
from a highly excited youngster...

957
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:29,755
...that there were some soiled doves
swinging through here.

958
01:34:34,346 --> 01:34:35,890
What do you want from me?

959
01:34:35,973 --> 01:34:38,058
Madam, you know young boys.

960
01:34:38,185 --> 01:34:41,022
They dream of golden skin
and unbound hair.

961
01:34:41,899 --> 01:34:45,360
Even if I could lock them up
they'd find a way of getting here.

962
01:34:46,279 --> 01:34:48,823
There's very little I can do about that.

963
01:34:48,990 --> 01:34:51,785
I'm sure you'd handle everything
most tastefully.

964
01:34:52,871 --> 01:34:57,167
It's a question of waiting for a more
appropriate time in their lives.

965
01:34:58,628 --> 01:35:01,423
Perhaps it would be wiser
to wait until next year.

966
01:35:01,633 --> 01:35:03,218
Or even the year after.

967
01:35:04,470 --> 01:35:07,097
With any luck I'll be retired by then.

968
01:35:13,565 --> 01:35:16,443
The first time should be
in the back of a buggy with...

969
01:35:16,527 --> 01:35:18,738
...a girl they think they're in love with.

970
01:35:22,244 --> 01:35:23,411
All right.

971
01:35:24,287 --> 01:35:25,539
We'll move on.

972
01:35:27,125 --> 01:35:29,670
You're a charming and sensible lady.

973
01:35:34,092 --> 01:35:35,553
What about you?

974
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:39,516
Well, I have the inclination...

975
01:35:40,393 --> 01:35:43,062
...the maturity and the wherewithal...

976
01:35:44,314 --> 01:35:47,402
...but unfortunately, I don't have the time.

977
01:36:24,034 --> 01:36:25,202
You got 'em?

978
01:36:25,286 --> 01:36:26,329
Yeah.

979
01:36:32,086 --> 01:36:33,630
Can you fix it?

980
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,131
I think so.

981
01:36:35,633 --> 01:36:37,551
Catch us by suppertime?

982
01:36:38,219 --> 01:36:39,638
Do what I can.

983
01:36:39,764 --> 01:36:42,099
Homer, drop out and help him.

984
01:37:08,301 --> 01:37:10,011
- Mr. Andersen...
- I know.

985
01:37:11,013 --> 01:37:14,350
They've been parallelin' us
for the better part of an hour.

986
01:37:14,725 --> 01:37:17,271
- What do you suppose they want?
- The herd.

987
01:37:17,397 --> 01:37:21,109
Now you just go on about your business
like you hadn't seen 'em.

988
01:37:21,277 --> 01:37:23,362
I'll pass the word to the rest.

989
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:56,406
Think you can do somethin' kinda ticklish?

990
01:37:56,490 --> 01:37:57,575
Sure.

991
01:37:57,909 --> 01:37:59,827
I want you to fade back and...

992
01:38:00,579 --> 01:38:02,332
...find Mr. Nightlinger.

993
01:38:02,582 --> 01:38:03,833
What'll I tell him?

994
01:38:03,917 --> 01:38:06,502
Tell him to load his gun
and hightail it up here.

995
01:38:06,587 --> 01:38:07,922
Yes, sir.

996
01:38:20,814 --> 01:38:22,066
Mr. Andersen?

997
01:38:23,151 --> 01:38:24,861
I can't find Weedy.

998
01:38:25,237 --> 01:38:28,991
Well, I sent him back after Mr. Nightlinger
a couple of hours ago.

999
01:38:29,451 --> 01:38:31,495
I don't know where the hell they are!

1000
01:38:31,578 --> 01:38:33,956
LLooks like we're gonna have a cold supper.

1001
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:35,541
You want me to go?

1002
01:38:35,833 --> 01:38:38,379
Son, I wish we could all go, but...

1003
01:38:38,964 --> 01:38:41,299
...we gotta stay put right here.

1004
01:38:42,927 --> 01:38:45,763
Here's some jerky.
Take a piece and pass it on.

1005
01:39:09,296 --> 01:39:10,964
As soon as it's dark...

1006
01:39:11,923 --> 01:39:13,592
...they'll be comin' in.

1007
01:39:14,678 --> 01:39:16,305
They're after the herd.

1008
01:39:17,849 --> 01:39:20,810
I don't know who they are
or how rough they'll get.

1009
01:39:22,229 --> 01:39:26,484
But right now they think
we're one man and a bunch of kids.

1010
01:39:27,820 --> 01:39:30,364
And that's what we're gonna let 'em think.

1011
01:39:30,656 --> 01:39:33,910
I know you're more than that, a lot more...

1012
01:39:34,787 --> 01:39:37,498
...but this is no time to try and prove it.

1013
01:39:38,208 --> 01:39:42,088
You act like you just came out
of Ellen Price's grammar school and...

1014
01:39:42,673 --> 01:39:44,258
...you'll be all right.

1015
01:39:45,093 --> 01:39:47,596
Now scatter and get us some firewood.

1016
01:39:59,529 --> 01:40:02,532
- What's the matter with you?
- I should have told you.

1017
01:40:02,867 --> 01:40:04,494
Told me what?

1018
01:40:04,827 --> 01:40:07,372
They've been following us for a long time.

1019
01:40:07,539 --> 01:40:10,126
I should have told you, but I was scared.

1020
01:40:10,210 --> 01:40:12,921
- They said they'd kill me.
- Who said that?

1021
01:40:13,005 --> 01:40:16,050
The man with the long hair
who came looking for work.

1022
01:40:21,558 --> 01:40:24,436
Don't worry, Dan. It's not your fault.

1023
01:40:25,855 --> 01:40:27,525
You got plenty of guts.

1024
01:40:28,526 --> 01:40:31,821
Now get out there and give 'em a hand
gettin' that firewood.

1025
01:40:46,341 --> 01:40:47,467
Hello, there.

1026
01:40:53,768 --> 01:40:55,520
Remember what I told you.

1027
01:41:08,495 --> 01:41:10,456
Well, bless my soul.

1028
01:41:11,959 --> 01:41:15,087
If it ain't Mr. Wil Andersen
of the Double-O!

1029
01:41:20,386 --> 01:41:24,558
We knew it was gonna take you
a long time herdin' little boys and cows...

1030
01:41:26,394 --> 01:41:29,856
...but ain't no way we thought
it was gonna take you this long.

1031
01:41:32,444 --> 01:41:34,571
Winter's comin' on, ol' friend...

1032
01:41:35,948 --> 01:41:39,077
...and we gotta get these cattle
to Belle Fourche.

1033
01:41:40,955 --> 01:41:42,499
How far would you say it is?

1034
01:41:42,667 --> 01:41:44,001
I didn't say.

1035
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:47,380
If you was to say.

1036
01:41:49,842 --> 01:41:51,552
Four or five days.

1037
01:41:55,849 --> 01:41:57,769
Two or three is more like it.

1038
01:42:00,983 --> 01:42:02,567
You know, I'm hungry.

1039
01:42:03,819 --> 01:42:06,739
And I remember you had
a chuck wagon and a nigger.

1040
01:42:07,032 --> 01:42:08,367
Where are they?

1041
01:42:09,118 --> 01:42:12,955
They're behind us. I sent a boy back
to find out what was holding him up.

1042
01:42:13,039 --> 01:42:14,666
Well, I know the boy.

1043
01:42:16,503 --> 01:42:18,088
Bring him on in here.

1044
01:42:21,718 --> 01:42:25,097
I don't suppose you mean
this stalwart young man here, do ya?

1045
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:31,981
Are you all right, boy?

1046
01:42:32,064 --> 01:42:33,149
Yes, sir.

1047
01:42:33,233 --> 01:42:34,527
Mr. Andersen...

1048
01:42:35,278 --> 01:42:39,324
...do I look like the kinda man to you
that would beat on an innocent boy?

1049
01:42:42,329 --> 01:42:45,624
You look like the vermin-ridden
son of a bitch you are.

1050
01:42:47,461 --> 01:42:49,838
Well, my sainted momma didn't think so.

1051
01:42:52,634 --> 01:42:54,720
You get over there and sit down.

1052
01:42:55,972 --> 01:42:57,682
Go on. Now!

1053
01:42:58,600 --> 01:42:59,601
And sit down!

1054
01:42:59,685 --> 01:43:02,230
And the rest of you boys, sit down,
right now!

1055
01:43:08,697 --> 01:43:10,115
Now ol' friend...

1056
01:43:11,117 --> 01:43:12,744
...I'll have the gun.

1057
01:43:13,287 --> 01:43:14,580
That's right.

1058
01:43:25,302 --> 01:43:28,515
I'll also have the belt,
'cause you ain't gonna need it.

1059
01:43:35,817 --> 01:43:37,068
That's good.

1060
01:43:41,658 --> 01:43:44,202
Pick it up and bring it over to me.

1061
01:43:53,131 --> 01:43:54,757
I don't think you heard what I said!

1062
01:43:54,842 --> 01:43:58,972
I said to bend over, pick up the belt
and bring it right here to me, now!

1063
01:44:26,593 --> 01:44:27,844
Pride.

1064
01:44:28,511 --> 01:44:30,180
Stubborn pride.

1065
01:44:32,016 --> 01:44:33,518
I admire that.

1066
01:44:35,438 --> 01:44:37,106
That truly is...

1067
01:44:38,399 --> 01:44:40,109
...an admirable quality.

1068
01:44:41,654 --> 01:44:44,949
To tell you the truth,
I wouldn't have picked it up, either.

1069
01:44:50,458 --> 01:44:51,959
Mr. Andersen...

1070
01:44:52,126 --> 01:44:55,380
...how much would you say
that them cattle are worth apiece?

1071
01:44:58,510 --> 01:44:59,762
$15?

1072
01:45:00,638 --> 01:45:01,889
$16?

1073
01:45:02,391 --> 01:45:04,017
Maybe $17 a head?

1074
01:45:06,521 --> 01:45:07,897
Now, old friend...

1075
01:45:10,401 --> 01:45:13,278
...I am ready to be rich.

1076
01:45:23,876 --> 01:45:25,420
You, come here!

1077
01:45:27,048 --> 01:45:28,758
Right now! Get up!

1078
01:45:37,061 --> 01:45:39,355
You kept our little secret, didn't ya?

1079
01:45:41,275 --> 01:45:42,985
- Answer him.
- Yes, sir.

1080
01:45:44,362 --> 01:45:46,240
You don't listen to him anymore.

1081
01:45:46,323 --> 01:45:48,868
You gotta look to me now,
you understand that?

1082
01:45:48,952 --> 01:45:51,329
- How old are you?
- I just turned 13.

1083
01:45:51,873 --> 01:45:52,999
Really?

1084
01:45:53,082 --> 01:45:55,711
By the time I was your age,
I had already killed a man.

1085
01:45:55,794 --> 01:45:58,047
- You done anything like that?
- No, sir.

1086
01:45:58,131 --> 01:45:59,549
I'll bet not.

1087
01:45:59,799 --> 01:46:02,802
- You're the runt of your family, ain't ya?
- Yes, sir.

1088
01:46:04,097 --> 01:46:05,724
Where are your glasses?

1089
01:46:05,808 --> 01:46:08,102
You had some glasses. Where are they?

1090
01:46:14,945 --> 01:46:17,031
Son, there's no glass in there.

1091
01:46:20,035 --> 01:46:21,829
You musta broken 'em, huh?

1092
01:46:23,665 --> 01:46:25,125
Say, look at that...

1093
01:46:26,210 --> 01:46:28,587
...I can see myself back home now.

1094
01:46:31,008 --> 01:46:33,010
And all them carpetbaggers
calling me mister.

1095
01:46:36,932 --> 01:46:41,354
I'd like 'em back when you're through.
They've been in my family for a long time.

1096
01:46:42,482 --> 01:46:44,609
Well, you can have 'em back. Here.

1097
01:46:46,278 --> 01:46:47,613
All right.

1098
01:46:48,615 --> 01:46:50,867
We've seen what you can do with a boy.

1099
01:46:50,952 --> 01:46:53,454
How are you when they come
a little bigger?

1100
01:46:55,541 --> 01:46:56,834
You mean you?

1101
01:46:57,042 --> 01:47:00,463
Yeah. Why don't you tell your boys
to just sit this one out?

1102
01:47:04,594 --> 01:47:07,056
You love to make it happen, don't ya?

1103
01:47:07,557 --> 01:47:09,183
You havin' any of it?

1104
01:47:10,394 --> 01:47:11,854
Well, sir, you're...

1105
01:47:13,355 --> 01:47:14,815
...a pretty old man.

1106
01:47:15,442 --> 01:47:18,028
Yeah, I'm 30 years older than you are.

1107
01:47:18,697 --> 01:47:21,783
Had my back broke once and my hip twice.

1108
01:47:22,492 --> 01:47:25,788
And on my worst day
I could beat the hell out of you.

1109
01:47:26,498 --> 01:47:27,833
I don't think so.

1110
01:47:28,501 --> 01:47:29,794
You will.

1111
01:47:35,135 --> 01:47:37,471
Get away from him! Get away from him!

1112
01:47:40,099 --> 01:47:42,602
You're mine. All mine.

1113
01:47:43,646 --> 01:47:46,357
Now, come on, you get up,
you son of a bitch.

1114
01:49:28,869 --> 01:49:30,537
You miserable wretch!

1115
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,084
Mount up!

1116
01:49:34,211 --> 01:49:36,087
Stop, you son of a bitch!

1117
01:49:36,213 --> 01:49:37,255
Go to hell!

1118
01:49:37,339 --> 01:49:39,841
Turn around!
I want you to see this comin'!

1119
01:49:40,218 --> 01:49:41,428
I said, stop!

1120
01:49:46,893 --> 01:49:48,937
You're mine, you old bastard.

1121
01:49:57,741 --> 01:49:59,076
LLeave him alone!

1122
01:49:59,201 --> 01:50:00,370
Get back.

1123
01:50:00,453 --> 01:50:02,497
Clear back, all of you.

1124
01:50:47,224 --> 01:50:48,559
We're leavin'.

1125
01:50:49,935 --> 01:50:52,938
- What about them kids?
- They're not goin' nowhere.

1126
01:50:53,148 --> 01:50:55,234
Take everything but the fire.

1127
01:51:42,798 --> 01:51:44,925
- What happened here?
- Rustlers.

1128
01:51:45,008 --> 01:51:47,803
They've been followin' us
since we started out.

1129
01:52:01,322 --> 01:52:03,241
Why would they do this to him?

1130
01:52:03,659 --> 01:52:05,911
Mr. Andersen put up a fight.

1131
01:52:08,039 --> 01:52:09,958
Ain't there anything we can do for him?

1132
01:52:10,084 --> 01:52:11,335
Yes, there is.

1133
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:14,173
You can be men.

1134
01:52:14,464 --> 01:52:15,799
Mr. Nightlinger...

1135
01:52:17,010 --> 01:52:19,053
...you're scarin' the boys.

1136
01:52:20,890 --> 01:52:22,349
You wanna sit up?

1137
01:52:22,976 --> 01:52:24,019
No.

1138
01:52:25,103 --> 01:52:26,939
Could you drink some whisky?

1139
01:52:27,524 --> 01:52:28,483
No.

1140
01:52:30,402 --> 01:52:31,778
Is there anything...?

1141
01:52:33,531 --> 01:52:35,242
I want you to see that...

1142
01:52:36,494 --> 01:52:38,330
...these boys all get home.

1143
01:52:39,539 --> 01:52:40,707
I will.

1144
01:52:43,545 --> 01:52:44,880
Summer's over.

1145
01:52:47,258 --> 01:52:48,593
Just about.

1146
01:52:56,938 --> 01:52:58,523
I'm proud of ya.

1147
01:53:00,526 --> 01:53:01,736
All of ya.

1148
01:53:03,405 --> 01:53:05,241
Every man wants his...

1149
01:53:05,991 --> 01:53:07,660
...children to be...

1150
01:53:08,245 --> 01:53:09,871
...better than he was.

1151
01:53:12,918 --> 01:53:14,127
You are.

1152
01:53:36,407 --> 01:53:38,076
This may seem...

1153
01:53:39,412 --> 01:53:41,664
...a lonesome place to leave him.

1154
01:53:44,585 --> 01:53:46,169
But he's not alone.

1155
01:53:48,257 --> 01:53:49,425
Because...

1156
01:53:50,634 --> 01:53:53,137
...many of his kind rest here with him.

1157
01:53:56,225 --> 01:53:57,518
The prairie...

1158
01:53:58,729 --> 01:54:01,023
...was like a mother to Mr. Andersen.

1159
01:54:03,151 --> 01:54:04,777
He belonged to her.

1160
01:54:06,865 --> 01:54:09,326
She cared for him while he lived...

1161
01:54:17,086 --> 01:54:19,047
...and she's nursing him...

1162
01:54:21,050 --> 01:54:22,593
...while he sleeps.

1163
01:54:50,505 --> 01:54:51,882
What?

1164
01:55:07,194 --> 01:55:08,737
What are you doing?

1165
01:55:28,056 --> 01:55:32,060
We didn't want to do it this way,
but we knew you wouldn't give 'em to us.

1166
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,397
So, we're gonna get the herd back...

1167
01:55:34,522 --> 01:55:36,734
...and take it on to Belle Fourche.

1168
01:55:37,611 --> 01:55:39,863
You're gonna get yourselves killed.

1169
01:55:41,323 --> 01:55:43,033
We're gonna finish a job.

1170
01:56:06,690 --> 01:56:08,275
Better have a plan.

1171
01:56:10,362 --> 01:56:12,698
Turn me loose and we'll make one.

1172
01:56:15,160 --> 01:56:16,495
Cut him loose.

1173
01:57:25,044 --> 01:57:26,254
Dung heap!

1174
02:00:37,926 --> 02:00:39,386
Come on in!

1175
02:00:45,101 --> 02:00:47,396
What the hell's the matter with them?

1176
02:00:50,526 --> 02:00:51,694
Mount up!

1177
02:02:05,792 --> 02:02:07,085
LLook at that.

1178
02:02:07,713 --> 02:02:08,964
Come on.

1179
02:02:57,862 --> 02:03:00,907
You've been behind this all the time,
ain't ya, nigger?

1180
02:03:00,990 --> 02:03:03,285
Not at first, but I came round to it.

1181
02:03:03,412 --> 02:03:05,956
You take your hat off
when you talk to me, mister!

1182
02:03:07,667 --> 02:03:11,797
Now you're actin' mighty calm
considerin' what it is I got in store for you.

1183
02:03:12,465 --> 02:03:15,593
What have you got to show me
that I haven't seen before?

1184
02:03:15,678 --> 02:03:17,763
Don't you sass me, you black!

1185
02:03:19,516 --> 02:03:20,893
Give me that rope.

1186
02:03:23,354 --> 02:03:24,564
This is what?

1187
02:03:24,732 --> 02:03:27,609
You ever seen one of these?
You ever seen a nigger run?

1188
02:03:27,693 --> 02:03:29,069
Come on! Come on!

1189
02:03:31,365 --> 02:03:33,159
Get up! Get up!

1190
02:03:45,592 --> 02:03:47,385
Since you mean to hang me...

1191
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:49,806
...I'd like to atone to my Maker.

1192
02:03:54,812 --> 02:03:56,272
You got one minute.

1193
02:03:57,442 --> 02:03:58,777
Speak your piece.

1194
02:03:58,943 --> 02:04:00,320
Where to begin?

1195
02:04:02,948 --> 02:04:05,619
I regret having trifled with married women.

1196
02:04:07,663 --> 02:04:10,666
I'm thoroughly ashamed
of having cheated at cards.

1197
02:04:12,836 --> 02:04:16,007
I deplore my occasional departures
from the truth.

1198
02:04:18,970 --> 02:04:21,473
Forgive me for taking Your name in vain...

1199
02:04:21,973 --> 02:04:24,894
...my Saturday drunkenness,
my Sunday sloth.

1200
02:04:27,607 --> 02:04:28,942
Above all...

1201
02:04:30,568 --> 02:04:33,239
...forgive me for the men I've killed
in anger...

1202
02:04:33,824 --> 02:04:35,826
...and for those I'm about to.

1203
02:06:52,215 --> 02:06:54,134
I think my leg is broken.

1204
02:06:57,389 --> 02:06:58,808
Don't let him get up.

1205
02:06:58,892 --> 02:07:01,144
Oh, my God, don't let him get up.

1206
02:07:07,444 --> 02:07:09,238
I think my leg is broke.

1207
02:07:12,576 --> 02:07:15,162
The other one is hung up.

1208
02:07:22,672 --> 02:07:23,799
You!

1209
02:07:25,593 --> 02:07:27,429
Son, please cut me loose.

1210
02:07:28,263 --> 02:07:29,389
Please!

1211
02:07:30,016 --> 02:07:31,684
I'll make it worth your while.

1212
02:07:32,268 --> 02:07:33,478
I promise.

1213
02:07:44,410 --> 02:07:45,703
Oh, thank you.

1214
02:07:56,134 --> 02:07:57,427
Don't! Don't!

1215
02:07:58,512 --> 02:07:59,972
Stop him!

1216
02:08:00,055 --> 02:08:01,473
Stop him!

1217
02:08:02,476 --> 02:08:04,103
Stop him!

1218
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:09,025
Stop him!

1219
02:09:30,008 --> 02:09:31,760
They're just kids!

1220
02:10:21,912 --> 02:10:23,830
Now what do you want on it?

1221
02:10:27,753 --> 02:10:29,546
His name. Wil Andersen.

1222
02:10:34,469 --> 02:10:35,803
Anything else?

1223
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:39,684
LLike what?

1224
02:10:39,769 --> 02:10:42,939
Well, it's usual to say something like,
"Rest in Peace."

1225
02:10:43,941 --> 02:10:45,275
"Eternal Sleep."

1226
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:47,111
"In Fond Memory of..."

1227
02:10:52,076 --> 02:10:53,786
Was he a family man?

1228
02:10:54,329 --> 02:10:56,040
Did he have any children?

1229
02:10:56,874 --> 02:10:57,875
Yes.

1230
02:10:58,585 --> 02:11:01,421
Well, then I carve:
"Beloved Husband and Father."

1231
02:11:07,097 --> 02:11:08,473
That'd be fine.

1232
02:11:12,270 --> 02:11:13,647
I don't see it.

1233
02:11:14,022 --> 02:11:15,941
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

1234
02:11:16,025 --> 02:11:17,652
I remember that tree.

1235
02:11:19,195 --> 02:11:21,239
There must've been a heavy rain.

1236
02:11:21,365 --> 02:11:22,659
Washed it away.

1237
02:11:28,124 --> 02:11:30,376
We ain't never gonna find it now.

1238
02:11:30,502 --> 02:11:31,754
Come on in.

1239
02:11:41,726 --> 02:11:43,519
I think it's close enough.

1240
02:11:44,980 --> 02:11:47,357
Well, come on, we're burnin' daylight.

1241
02:11:48,305 --> 02:11:54,834
