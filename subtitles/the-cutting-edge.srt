Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,800
It's 1 :00.
It's 1 :00 in the afternoon.

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,370
I got a game.

4
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,030
The hell happened to the alarm?
I'm supposed to be on the ice.

5
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,900
You say, "nein."

6
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,700
- Yeah, 9:00. What happened?
- Yeah, "nein."

7
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,400
Badge. Shirt.

8
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,240
You say, "nein alarm." Is mistake?

9
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,350
No. No mistake.

10
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,250
This is great. Late for the Olympics.
I'm just about four hours late, Rita.

11
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,050
- "Rita"?
- I don't believe this.

12
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,690
"Rita"?

13
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,500
- Leta?
- "Leta"?

14
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,030
Anita.

15
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,140
Namen, Gita.

16
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,870
Gita.

17
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,540
This is the Olympics, Kate.
Thirty million people...

18
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,840
...just called their families in
from the kitchen to watch the replay.

19
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,210
What do you think this is, Kate?
Junior Pairs '82?

20
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,050
No. As I recall, in '82 you were
still humiliating me in private.

21
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,020
Maybe because
you were still listening.

22
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,460
If I'm going deaf, it's because
I've had you...

23
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,220
...screaming in my ear
for the last nine years.

24
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,870
He's not giving me
anything to work with.

25
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,300
Rick, this is impossible.

26
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,730
I wanna see your ass in the air.

27
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,420
Until Hercules here
learns how to lock his grip...

28
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,560
...this will have to do.

29
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,070
- Name, son?
- Dorsey, U.S. hockey.

30
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,830
Hell, son, they're just about to start.

31
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,470
Kate, this has to stop right now.

32
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,270
Rick knows what's best, honey.
He got us here.

33
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,680
How sweet. He lets us tag along.

34
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,480
You're gonna go back out there,
apologize, and get to work.

35
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,020
I wouldn't bet the ranch, Dad.

36
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,290
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'll be in my cell.

37
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,420
What--? What are you--?

38
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,180
Does this go up to the ice?

39
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,690
Does this go up to the ice?

40
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,660
- What?
- Does this go up to the ice?

41
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,630
Is that all you have to say?
Were you raised in a barn?

42
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,000
Honey, where I'm from,
we stand for the national anthem.

43
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,440
If you're just joining us
from the men's downhill...

44
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,710
- ...you're in for a big surprise.
- West Germany was supposed...

45
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,290
...to be easy for the United States,
but here in the third period...

46
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,260
...West Germany is up by a goal.
Doug Dorsey, down to the last dime...

47
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,690
...of a two-minute penalty
for high-sticking.

48
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,760
- He can't wait. Neither can the fans.
- Come on.

49
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,770
Four, three, two, one.

50
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,930
Dorsey running out.

51
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,730
They'll hit him with the breakaway.
It's offside.

52
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,510
Doug Dorsey, the phenom
from Mayhorn, Minnesota.

53
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,110
What a super story, Bud.
A junior from Minnesota State.

54
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,140
Talk about being on the fast track.

55
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,010
There are at least 12 NHL clubs
that'd love to have him on their roster.

56
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,950
Just an incredible young athlete.

57
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,990
If you haven't seen him before,
you're in for a real treat.

58
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,820
We're talking about one of the finest
skaters in amateur hockey today.

59
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,260
There was a piece this week.
A writer called him:

60
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,560
"The Minnesota Machine."

61
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,170
U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A.

62
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,900
For the record...

63
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,170
...you've lost 18 degrees
of peripheral vision in your right eye.

64
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,330
Now, in most cases, this would be
considered an inconvenience.

65
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,800
- But for a hockey player--
- So how long before it comes back?

66
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,080
You've had extreme trauma
to your occipital lobe.

67
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,080
Doc, how long?

68
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,390
You got a blind side, Doug.

69
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,560
It's a permanent condition.

70
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,290
- So there's an operation, right?
- I'm afraid not.

71
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,400
Some micro-laser thing....
You open me up and--

72
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,570
Doug, I've specialized in ophthalmic
surgery for over 15 years.

73
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,140
Okay, you don't do it, but somebody,
somewhere.... Down in Mexico City...

74
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,680
...they shoot shark piss up your nose,
you sit in traction for eight months.

75
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,110
Doug...

76
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,320
...I'm sorry.

77
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,850
I don't see professional hockey
in your future.

78
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,510
- See you at the game tonight, Doug.
- Not if I see you first.

79
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,490
- See you, Mike.
- Mike.

80
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,750
Anybody seen my wife?

81
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,400
Ice-time meltdown.

82
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,400
You're listening to WICV,
Duluth, Minnesota.

83
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,000
We're gonna warm you up.

84
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,640
- Hi, Doug.
- Ln a hurry. Any mail?

85
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,110
- No.
- I got a game. Make me a sandwich.

86
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,880
Little brother, Snyder can't make it.
I need a hand.

87
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,710
- I got a game.
- Hi, Dougie.

88
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,560
- It's Friday night.
- Make me a sandwich.

89
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,420
- I need a hand.
- I need a sandwich.

90
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,500
Dougie, wait a minute.

91
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,360
Doug, I got no place else to go.

92
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,800
You're my brother,
not my boss, okay?

93
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,970
Douglas, I'm not asking you,
I'm telling you.

94
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,130
Will you get off my back?
I'm no bartender. Get used to it.

95
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,100
What the hell's that mean?
What makes you so special?

96
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,350
You're playing
in a goddamn bar league.

97
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,080
Hey, Walt, at least I'm playing.

98
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:19,350
Hey. Your 23rd letter arrived today.

99
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,950
Detroit Red Wings.

100
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,490
It's over, little brother.
Everybody knows it but you.

101
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,230
- Give me that.
- "Doug, sorry about the eye.

102
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,660
- Next time you're in town...
- Give me that letter.

103
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,500
- ...we'll buy you a ticket."
- Give me that goddamn letter!

104
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,200
What are you gonna do?

105
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,710
You gonna fight me?

106
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,880
Are you gonna fight the world?
Everybody?

107
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,480
Well, put me on the list, pal.
Come on, let's go.

108
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,150
You want something to eat,
make it yourself.

109
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,480
All right, Kate. Enough.

110
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,650
Lovely. Let's do it again.

111
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,960
Do we or do we not
have eight minutes left?

112
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,260
Enough for today.

113
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,600
Perhaps you are wanting
to take shower, da?

114
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,030
All right.

115
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,980
What he needs
is a ride to the airport.

116
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,410
I've got laundry that
can skate better than that.

117
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,340
He lasted a month.

118
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,460
You should've been making
her singles skater.

119
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,720
So where do we go from here?

120
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,960
Two years, eight partners.

121
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,570
This one too small.
That one too big. Too loud.

122
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,300
Too much sweat. Not enough sweat.

123
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,940
Jack, she is tremendous skater.

124
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,800
Everyone is saying this.

125
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,070
Petite. Powerful. Intelligent.

126
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,720
But always is coming the big B.

127
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,510
What a bitch.

128
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,350
- What about Spindler?
- Spindler?

129
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,720
Spindler say
before he skate with her...

130
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,550
...he wear garlic from neck
and sleep with cross.

131
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,660
Who is left?

132
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,930
I am....

133
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,130
I am at bottom of barrel.

134
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,040
Then you find another barrel.

135
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,790
You are bigger than I think.

136
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,300
- What?
- You are much bigger than I think.

137
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,070
I'm spending much time
watching video of you...

138
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,110
...Mr. Douglas Dorsey.

139
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,080
You are very exciting skater.

140
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,340
If you're a reporter, you're a little late.
The story's been done.

141
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,080
No. I am coach.

142
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,780
What, you goof on me,
my brother buys you a beer?

143
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,550
What means "goof"?

144
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,960
- Are you the Swede?
- No, I'm Russian.

145
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,860
My name is Anton Pamchenko.

146
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,760
From the Leafs. I can't believe it.
You got my letter.

147
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,870
I'm in the best shape of my life.
I'm like a rock.

148
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,270
I skate five, six hours a night,
speed drills, stick drills, roadwork.

149
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,710
I am not hockey coach.

150
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,940
- What is this?
- Maybe nothing.

151
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,940
Here.

152
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,020
You try.

153
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,060
Those are figure skates, pal.

154
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,460
I should've held out for more.

155
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,230
This way.

156
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,760
- You got your own rink.
- We have ice every day.

157
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,210
That's not Spindler.

158
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,620
Where the hell is Spindler?
I thought you said he'd be here.

159
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,220
No. You said Spindler.
This is Dorsey.

160
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,360
Mr. Douglas Dorsey.

161
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,420
Dorsey? Never heard of him.

162
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,530
Douglas is beautiful skater.

163
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,040
You're that hockey player.

164
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,740
How you doing?

165
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,940
- Nice to meet you.
- Ls tryout.

166
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,640
Is tryout.

167
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,150
Oh, my God.

168
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,330
- What, my hand?
- What do you do?

169
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,930
Soak them in battery acid?

170
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,330
I know they're rough, but I've never
had any complaints before.

171
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,260
Oh, I'm terribly impressed.

172
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,100
What is this, final stages
of Ukrainian alcohol psychosis?

173
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,870
Who's checking out who here?

174
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,540
I don't know how many shots
you've taken to the brain...

175
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,540
...but this was your audition.
And let me assure you, it's over.

176
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,310
Snow White, I'm no figure skater.
I'm a hockey player.

177
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,990
Then what are you doing here?

178
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,450
Get him out of my building.

179
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,560
- What?
- Get him out of my building.

180
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,600
Temperamental?
I can think of another word for it.

181
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,260
- Ls that what you told him?
- It's a big secret?

182
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,870
- Who do you think you are?
- I know exactly who I am.

183
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,700
A guy who came
a long way for lunch.

184
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,640
Please don't let me keep you
from the trough.

185
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,540
I'm sorry, buddy. I wouldn't wish this
on a snake. I'm out of here.

186
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,050
Enough.

187
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,580
Introduction is over.
Conversation finished.

188
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,760
Mouths closed.
Ears to be opened.

189
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,290
Pairs means two.
You have no partner.

190
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,690
You're skating nowhere.

191
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,920
And where are you going?
Oh, back to Siberia?

192
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,400
Skating on small pond
is big excitement.

193
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,270
Believe me, Gretzky...

194
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,570
...I am last person
who's coming to look for you.

195
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,380
Good.

196
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,380
We skate.

197
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:28,050
You are taking her left hand,
and your right hand is at her waist.

198
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,660
Good. The line is beautiful.

199
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,260
Now I am counting a beat.

200
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,430
You push off on four.
Katya will lead.

201
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,570
Hey, hold on.
What's the deal with these...

202
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,360
...claws up front here?

203
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,470
- Ls toe pick.
- Toe pick?

204
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,340
Let me guess. It has something
to do with personal hygiene.

205
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,280
- I wouldn't let that get in your way.
- I don't let anything get in my way.

206
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,620
Count it off.

207
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,750
And one and four.

208
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,420
Good. Good. Head up. Yes.

209
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,030
Arms up. Katya, keep in line with him.

210
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,030
Is not race, Katya.

211
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,190
Together. Together.

212
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,370
- What, you shower once a week?
- Ls that an invitation?

213
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,540
Douglas, bend knees more.

214
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,140
Good.

215
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,900
Hey. Hey.

216
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,940
Oh, shit.

217
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,110
Toe pick.

218
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,390
Katya, lift arms, please.

219
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,610
Go on. Lift arms.

220
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,530
Douglas, please to pick her up.

221
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,200
- Yeah?
- Yes.

222
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,590
Pick up.

223
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,570
Okay. Enough.

224
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,970
- We are finish.
- I told you this was ridiculous.

225
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,180
Would you please put me down?

226
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,850
You-- You cretin.

227
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,520
Guess that move needs some work.

228
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,100
What a waste of good ice.

229
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,870
Ridiculous.

230
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,700
Stare at it long enough, you'll start
to see an Olympic gold medal in there.

231
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,580
Jack Moseley. Sit down.
Sit down, please.

232
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,690
Look, I've spoken with Anton.

233
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,580
First of all, the simple fact
that he brought you out--

234
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,920
You should feel proud.
I mean, we're talking...

235
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:52,220
...about probably the greatest
judge of skating talent in the world.

236
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,660
Central Soviet Army Sports Club,
Moscow lce Ballet, the works.

237
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,730
I saw you skate in Calgary.

238
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,460
You were a great,
great hockey player.

239
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:04,160
Don't feel as though this were
a complete waste of time.

240
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,710
I mean, it was worth a shot.

241
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,580
- What, the eye?
- No, the eye's not a problem.

242
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,510
Is it your daughter?

243
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,210
Kate is Kate.

244
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,410
She's an only child,
raised without a mother.

245
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,950
The strain of competition....

246
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,860
Sudden changes tend
to bring out...

247
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,120
...her color.

248
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,660
Is that what that was?

249
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,760
Frankly, the idea's just
a little too bizarre for me.

250
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,730
I believe you're on a 10:30 flight,
first class.

251
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,930
- There's a check for your trouble.
- This is called giving me a shot?

252
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,940
I don't have time to screw around.
I can't afford to be wrong about you.

253
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,210
We were 45 seconds away
from the gold medal.

254
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,940
And our boy dropped the ball.

255
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,480
That goddamn glass box
is empty for one reason:

256
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,380
We can't find a go-to guy.

257
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,520
Thirty-five male skaters.

258
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,790
These boys have been doing this
for years and couldn't cut it.

259
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,460
Wagner...

260
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,230
...no stamina.

261
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:08,230
Myersohn, no rhythm.

262
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,490
Leone, Parnes, Hudler.

263
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,770
Not one single pressure-player
in the bunch.

264
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,960
Lucky shot.

265
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,740
Double or nothing.

266
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,580
You're on.

267
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,260
Katie, there you are.

268
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,590
Hi. I was just coming
to say goodbye.

269
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,530
Hold that thought.
Doug's staying with us for a while.

270
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,430
- Good talking to you, Jack.
- Doug.

271
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,830
Catch your act tomorrow.

272
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,510
It's the end of the line, honey.

273
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,820
If we're working together,
try being polite.

274
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,350
You won't be here long enough
to make it worth the effort.

275
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,750
- Think I can't put up with your shit?
- I don't think you can skate.

276
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,150
There's two things I do
really well, sweetheart.

277
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,990
And skating's the other one.

278
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,600
God. You really are a Neanderthal.

279
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,930
I hate to tell you,
but I'm from Minnesota.

280
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,070
That's south of Neanderthal.

281
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:57,600
What do you do for fun,
polish your knife collection?

282
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:01,210
I'm sure there's nothing I do
that you'd find exciting.

283
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,240
I don't open beer bottles
with my toes.

284
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,740
I don't sit around and count
what's left of my teeth.

285
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,410
Hey, I don't even enjoy
a good tractor-pull.

286
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,750
Limited existence,
but I've gotten used to it.

287
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,420
Life of the party.
Place must be crawling with guys.

288
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,590
As a matter of fact,
I do have a boyfriend.

289
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,260
A rough gig. You keep him
chained up in the basement?

290
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,230
Hale, at the moment, is working
in my father's London office.

291
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,860
He's an M.B.A.

292
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:29,970
Harvard. You might've heard of it.
They do have a hockey team.

293
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,660
Must be a very smart guy.

294
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,930
First position.

295
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,370
Bet you look good
from a few thousand miles away.

296
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,140
Okay, Douglas.

297
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,800
Come. Shoulders back.

298
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,780
Good, good. Now, chest out.

299
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,320
Yes. Shoulders back. Head higher.

300
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,690
When we're through, can we teach it
how to breathe with its mouth closed?

301
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,420
Don't quit your day job.

302
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,700
Man and woman
together make flower.

303
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,840
Douglas, you are stem.

304
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,630
Katya, you are petal.

305
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,470
Together, we make flower.

306
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,510
Toe pick.

307
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,120
Toe pick.

308
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,490
Toe pick.

309
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,400
Toe pick.

310
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,300
Whoa. Dorsey back to Gretzky,
over to Esposito.

311
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,200
LaFontaine to Dorsey.
Dorsey to Gretzky.

312
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,840
Gretzky to Dorsey.
Dorsey shoots. He scores.

313
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,570
Yes.

314
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,990
If you're bored, why not read?

315
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:38,090
- What, you mean a book?
- That's a traditionally accepted format.

316
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,720
Is this the beginning
of a conversation here?

317
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,660
I was just simply asking
if you knew how to read.

318
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,430
Yes. Doug can read.

319
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,730
What was the last book you read?

320
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,800
You were in college.

321
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,530
Last thing I read was a letter
canceling my scholarship...

322
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,140
...when I couldn't play anymore.

323
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,180
- Okay. High school.
- I was a hockey player.

324
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,350
The only thing I had to read
was a scoreboard.

325
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,780
- And they graduated you?
- They revered me. I was a god.

326
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,080
What a tragic commentary
on our times.

327
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,690
State championships,
my last game...

328
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,920
...three hundred people carried me
around their shoulders on the ice.

329
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,490
It took the state police
two hours to break it up.

330
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,130
What were you planning on doing
when your gladiating days were over?

331
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,100
You can bet your tights I never thought
I'd work in a freak show like this.

332
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,760
I'm surprised you don't chuck it all
and start your own think tank.

333
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,930
So where'd you matriculate from?

334
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,140
You were in college?

335
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,250
I had tutors.

336
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,450
Excellent tutors.

337
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:54,830
Would you please find someplace
else to put your clubs?

338
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,360
Man, would I love
to see you play hockey.

339
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,960
Any day.

340
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,340
You can do better than that.
Come on.

341
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,880
Hey.

342
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,380
Come on.

343
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,410
That's one.

344
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,840
Come on, take it.

345
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,210
Cut it out.

346
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,120
That's two.

347
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,910
Stop it, you--

348
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,840
Three.

349
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,580
Four.

350
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,780
You make me ill.

351
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,950
It's not like his nose was perfect.

352
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,010
He's the one who wanted to play.

353
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:05,020
He's like those morons
who insist you hit them...

354
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,320
...in the stomach
as hard as you can.

355
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,750
I don't know why
I'm explaining this to you.

356
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,400
All I did was play his stupid game.

357
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,030
Next you'll be telling me
how guilty I sound.

358
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,470
Is not guilt.

359
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,970
Well, at least we agree on that.

360
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,170
Is fear.

361
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,810
You've gotta be kidding me.
What do I have to be afraid of?

362
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,740
Because finally you have
found yourself a partner.

363
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:37,210
Oh, my God. I thought you said
it was just his nose.

364
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:45,090
- What? What's wrong?
- He's all yours.

365
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,500
Toe pick.

366
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,140
What's her problem?

367
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,750
I think she is nervous
about rematch.

368
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,150
Kate.

369
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,910
You want my hands where?

370
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,820
You gotta be kidding.

371
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,760
- How am I doing?

372
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,360
Maybe in about five years...
...you'll get it up to half-speed.

373
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,650
Hey.

374
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,560
Hey, come on.

375
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,560
Douglas? Douglas, come back.

376
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,930
You have the mentality
of a rock, you know that?

377
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,500
Yes.

378
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,420
Yes. Yes. Yes.

379
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,860
She's got everything.

380
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,800
A house, the rink.

381
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,800
I don't get it.

382
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,570
You know something,
I don't even think she likes to skate.

383
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,570
You worked in factory.

384
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,580
You were happy there?

385
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,220
Hey, I worked there
because I had to.

386
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,750
Just a moment, please.

387
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,350
- Kate. Oh, you're--

388
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,780
What the hell are you doing?

389
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,990
- Did I say come in?
- No.

390
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,220
Get out. Get out.

391
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,750
Get out this second.

392
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,390
I handle this stuff all the time.
It's no big mystery.

393
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,130
- What's that?
- Open it up.

394
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,940
Go on.
I wrapped it myself.

395
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,300
What do you get for the girl
who has everything?

396
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,310
An old shirt.

397
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,280
An old shirt?
Bobby Hull wore that sweater.

398
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:25,280
That's Bobby Hull's game sweater.
That--

399
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,620
I've had that 15 years.

400
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,550
Bobby Hull.

401
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,290
- Forget it. I'll take it--
- No, no. I like it.

402
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,430
I'll get something else.

403
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,630
You'll tear it.

404
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,330
Then let go.

405
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,930
Thank you.

406
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,140
So anyway, merry Christmas.

407
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,540
Well, wait a minute.

408
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,650
Merry Christmas.

409
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,640
"Great Expectations."

410
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,250
Well, it was either that or
Curious George Plays Hockey.

411
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,610
I took a chance.

412
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,520
Thanks.

413
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,450
You're welcome.

414
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,670
Hale. Hale?

415
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,310
Kate. I was looking at your stuff.
Great pictures in here.

416
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,450
That's your mom, right?
Boy, she was a knockout.

417
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,620
Yes, she was very pretty.

418
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,310
She was a show skater.

419
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,150
There's one over here.
You look too young to walk yet.

420
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,720
You got skates on.

421
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:50,060
What is this expression on your face?
Is that a smile?

422
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,350
I never knew you had
so many teeth.

423
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,200
We usually keep this door
closed during a party.

424
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,990
Am I some guy off the street?

425
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,690
You probably didn't recognize me
in my rig here. It's pretty sharp, huh?

426
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,170
Sixty-nine ninety-five.

427
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,880
Turn around.

428
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,540
- What are you doing?
- Turn around.

429
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:23,290
- Done?
- Yes.

430
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,300
That book you gave me,
it's pretty good.

431
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,990
Really? Using it as a doorstop
or a coaster?

432
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,960
Very funny. Here.

433
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,700
- No, I don't drink.
- It's only champagne.

434
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,530
I've never had a drink in my life.

435
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,900
You're kidding.
You afraid you're gonna get fat?

436
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:44,480
- I hardly expect you to understand.
- Kate.

437
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,870
- Hale.
- There you are.

438
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,380
- Doug Dorsey, Hale Forrest.
- Well. Finally.

439
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,850
The secret weapon.

440
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,380
In the flesh.

441
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,850
I guess this calls for a toast.

442
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,330
Let's drink to the little people.

443
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,100
I understand you were
at Minnesota State.

444
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,600
For a while.

445
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,960
I used to play
a little hockey myself. For fun.

446
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,240
Let me know.
We'll slap it around sometime.

447
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,580
Sure. And maybe you
can stop by the office.

448
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,470
- Help me with currency arbitrage.
- Lf you two will excuse me.

449
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,710
Naked male-insecurity
really leaves me cold.

450
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,420
Must be tough to stay away.

451
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,160
I understand you're giving Kate
a rough time.

452
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,950
You know Kate.

453
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,250
Yes, I do. And I don't like
to see her upset.

454
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,430
If I was you,
I'd invest in blindfolds.

455
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,230
Seven, six, five...

456
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:13,920
...four, three, two, one.

457
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,330
Happy New Year.

458
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,560
Happy New Year.

459
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,070
Happy New Year.

460
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,110
Happy New Year.

461
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,380
Happy New Year, sweetheart.

462
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,320
Happy New Year!

463
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:24,430
- Who is it?
- It's me, Kate.

464
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,470
- Hi.
- Hi.

465
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,250
I spoke to Anton. He said you were
leaving for the weekend.

466
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,250
- What, that's a problem?
- No, it's great.

467
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:48,450
You haven't been home
since you got here.

468
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,750
They probably think we've got you
under lock and key.

469
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,890
- Come on in.
- I haven't been here in a while.

470
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,260
Not since Brian.
Brian had mirrors up all over.

471
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,760
Oh, yeah, I took them down.

472
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:02,870
It's kind of a mess.
I wasn't expecting any company.

473
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,300
What's this?

474
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,600
That's me smelling the ice.

475
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,910
I told this guy once
I loved how ice smelled.

476
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,380
It became this thing.
Somebody got a camera.

477
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,970
- I never thought about it.
- I'm not surprised.

478
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,580
What's that supposed to mean?

479
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,450
- Kate.
- I'll be right there.

480
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:21,850
What did you mean by that?

481
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:26,990
I think you'd skate even better
if you'd let yourself enjoy it a little.

482
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:30,760
Wait. What's this? I come up to say,
"Have a nice weekend"...

483
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,590
...and you're
gonna give me pointers?

484
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,230
- You brought it up.
- No, I didn't.

485
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:35,630
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

486
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,800
- Yes, you did.
- No--

487
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,380
I came to give you this.

488
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,410
- What's that?
- It's our greatest hits.

489
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,970
It's a video for your family...

490
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,810
...of us skating.

491
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,650
- Thanks.
- My dad booked some extra rooms...

492
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:57,480
...in Chicago, and we'd love them
to stay with us.

493
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,760
- My family?
- Yes. To the nationals.

494
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,720
They're coming, aren't they?

495
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,260
I don't know.

496
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,690
Look at all you've done.
They must be excited.

497
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,700
Honey, it's a 7::30 show.

498
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,700
- You better go.
- Why wouldn't they come?

499
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,560
They're coming. Hale's waiting.

500
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:15,670
How do you know
if you haven't told them?

501
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:18,360
- I'm gonna tell them.
- When?

502
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,770
- Now. This weekend.
- You sure?

503
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,540
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- Really?

504
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:25,720
Kate, believe me.
I'm dying to tell them.

505
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:57,710
Dougie? Dougie!

506
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,380
Doug.

507
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,320
Doug.
Hey, you're a captain now.

508
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:05,680
Doug.

509
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:11,690
Come on. Come on.
Would you let him up for air, dear.

510
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:13,620
Come on.

511
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:16,590
I'll be a son of a bitch.

512
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:25,370
Man, it's good to see you.

513
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:26,900
Yeah, it's good to see you too.

514
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:29,670
My brother Doug,
home from the merchant marine.

515
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,350
Did you forget
how to use the phone?

516
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:34,780
Come on.
Move back, move back.

517
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,710
He's been cruising
all over the world...

518
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,510
...and he can't even get to the bar.
Come on.

519
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,810
Ensign Dorsey. No, no--
Lieutenant, Captain Dorsey, huh?

520
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,580
- Cool it with the merchant marine.
- What?

521
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:49,960
- What?
- I didn't join the merchant marine.

522
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,530
- Still got your sea legs?
- Shush.

523
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:55,400
If you weren't with the merchant
marine, where were you?

524
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,600
Let's go outside
and talk about this.

525
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:02,040
- We're all family here.
- Tell us about it, tell us about it.

526
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,100
Come on. Tell me now.

527
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,710
Come on, chief.

528
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,140
Well, actually...

529
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,910
...it's kind of interesting.

530
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:14,580
Tell him.

531
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:22,190
I've been doing a little....

532
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,420
Been doing a little figure skating.

533
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,630
- Damn.
- What'd he say?

534
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,300
You been doing what?

535
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,100
Finger painting?

536
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,770
These people, they think
we can go all the way.

537
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,910
All the way to where?

538
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:46,050
To the nationals.
Walter, the cham--

539
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,120
You just don't understand.

540
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:50,280
Was it me? Was it something I did?

541
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:52,220
I'm telling you, I'm good.

542
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,690
Come on, Doug, you're a hockey
player. How good can you be?

543
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:00,820
Face it. If you're lucky,
a year from now...

544
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:04,660
...you'll be in a Snoopy costume
in the frigging lce Capades.

545
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:07,200
You think I'd spend
15 hours a day, every day...

546
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,500
...to win some consolation prize?

547
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,430
I'm talking an Olympic gold medal.

548
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:14,670
The girl. You're mixed up with
this broad. That's it, isn't it?

549
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,180
- It's a great opportunity.
- It's figure skating.

550
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,750
And I like it.

551
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:24,310
It's a lot goddamn harder than
playing hockey, I can tell you that.

552
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,920
And the stuff we're doing,
it's gonna be different.

553
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:30,780
The costumes, the music.
Everything is gonna be different.

554
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,660
You'll see.

555
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:39,160
Are they gonna make you
shave your legs?

556
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,030
Screw this. I don't even know why--

557
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,270
Gotcha.

558
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:53,340
Good. This is looking good.
Now....

559
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:55,380
Oh, I like it.

560
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,850
It's not too low, is it?

561
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:01,080
Well, we don't want him to hide
his light under a basket, do we?

562
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:05,950
Now, where to put this?
Here. Here.

563
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:07,750
I know.

564
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:15,040
Let's put it here.

565
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:18,030
- What do you think you're doing?
- Just getting started.

566
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:29,210
This is Mozart.

567
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:33,680
- It's not us.
- The deal was that we had to listen.

568
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,580
Kate, this is tired.

569
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:40,890
Ten thousand other skaters will cue up
the same boring crap.

570
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:44,700
This doesn't get it done.
It's like the costumes.

571
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,760
Let's be different.

572
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,160
Let's kick a little ass.

573
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:51,000
If you wanna see
some asses kicked...

574
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,370
...why don't you throw on some jeans
and skate to this.

575
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,400
If you wanna win,
you play it straight.

576
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:01,210
This is boring.

577
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,590
Unacceptable.

578
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,620
- Would you stop?
- Didn't work for you last time.

579
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:17,090
What?

580
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,260
You heard me.

581
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,460
- You have some nerve.
- Just listen to my music one second!

582
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:23,930
Stop turning it!

583
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:26,740
Guys.

584
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:29,430
Hey!

585
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,810
It's after midnight.

586
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:35,780
I have a 6:30 appointment.

587
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,740
We were just wrapping up.

588
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:43,120
Play him the Mozart.
You'll be asleep in no time.

589
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:51,130
Katya, please try to understand.

590
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:53,320
Douglas is not boy. He is man.

591
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,500
Is young, vigorous man.

592
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,260
I don't care. He has three months
to qualify for nationals.

593
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:01,600
- He needs every minute.
- Sure, sure. This I know.

594
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,140
And he is back on Monday.
And he will be working much better.

595
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,270
Really?

596
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:10,880
Katya, please, you know.

597
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,170
Solitude is....
Too much is not good, eh?

598
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,910
It's Christmas, we skate.
I have the flu, we skate.

599
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,150
I have a boyfriend in London
that I never see.

600
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,450
I skate every day so that you can play
Dr. Frankenstein with this guy.

601
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,130
I show up every morning
for seven months...

602
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:29,920
...so that you can give him two days
to go off whoring in New York City?

603
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:31,830
Is not entirely correct.

604
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,900
He went to Boston.

605
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:41,800
If I get her any higher...

606
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,330
...they'll need a putty knife to scrape
her off the ceiling. Am I right?

607
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,700
- Are we ready for nationals or what?
- We will be.

608
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:50,570
- Celebrating? We haven't won yet.
- To you, Doug.

609
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:54,070
Who's ready to order?
I think I'll start with some vichyssoise.

610
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:57,480
Five weeks to go.
Everything's clicking.

611
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,410
We're gonna kick some tail.

612
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,710
- Am I right?
- "Tail"? Excuse me?

613
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,280
- Some beluga.
- I'm eligible.

614
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:04,960
Doug Dorsey, licensed to thrill.

615
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,180
Slow down, champ.
We've got a long way to go.

616
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,950
- Trying to rain on my parade?
- Don't let her beat you down.

617
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,060
Hasn't happened by now,
he's in the clear.

618
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,600
Standing there doing nothing.
Get our menu.

619
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:17,830
- Now is not the time.
- Any specials or what?

620
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,500
Everyone's in such a great mood.

621
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,730
- I'll throw another log on the fire.
- Hale, now is not the time.

622
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,470
They'll find out sooner or later.
The fact is...

623
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,040
...I've asked Kate to marry me,
and she's accepted.

624
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,850
- Fantastic.
- Oh, Hale, congratulations.

625
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:34,880
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

626
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:37,280
- That's great.
- Katya, I want my kiss.

627
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:39,580
Show them the ring, Kate.

628
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:43,190
- Great. That's just great.
- Now, there's a piece of ice.

629
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:45,690
Hale, I think I'm paying
you altogether too much.

630
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,830
- What are you doing?
- We ready to order?

631
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:50,090
- Yeah.
- Sure.

632
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,590
Still dropping that shoulder.

633
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:58,620
I thought you'd retired.

634
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,190
I changed my mind.

635
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:08,400
You know what I think
is the saddest thing about sports?

636
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:10,940
People who stay too long
at the party.

637
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:16,780
- What are you doing here, Rick?
- I'd like to see you go out a champion.

638
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,410
That's my plan.

639
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:22,420
If you wanted to skate so badly,
why didn't you come to me?

640
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,320
- I know we made some mistakes.
- Mistakes?

641
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,150
You spent the last 10 years
tying me into knots.

642
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:30,890
You were always difficult.

643
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,530
Know what the first thing
you said to me was?

644
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,860
I was 9,
and you came into my building.

645
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:39,260
And I was skating.

646
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:42,240
And when I was finished,
I turned around...

647
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,930
...and, oh, my God,
there was Rick Tuttle.

648
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,800
And you know what you said?

649
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:50,040
You said, "Boy, do we have
our work cut out for us."

650
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,180
Still blaming Calgary on Brian?

651
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:57,750
You meant a lot to this sport, Kate.
You still do.

652
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,820
But nationals?
I mean, now, after all this time?

653
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:05,950
I just hate to see you humiliated.

654
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,290
- Humiliated?
- Oh, come on. This guy.

655
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,730
A hockey player?

656
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:16,760
Let's face it. Trusting partners
was never your strong suit.

657
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:19,940
This guy, this hockey player...

658
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,400
...is the best skater
I've been on the ice with.

659
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:25,100
He gonna make you cry,
he's so good.

660
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,750
You know your way out.

661
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:48,100
You let me down,
it'll take them a month...

662
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,070
...to count the blade marks
up your back.

663
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:53,570
Do me a favor, take off
the rock while we work.

664
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,470
It's cutting the hell out of my hand.

665
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:07,680
The United States
Figure Skating Association...

666
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:10,320
...welcomes you to the national
skating championships.

667
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,850
Congratulations
and the best of luck.

668
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:18,870
Douglas, free leg must be high.

669
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,590
Katya, head low.

670
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,330
Yes, your body must be tight.

671
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,770
- Like rush hour out here.
- Spindler and Nyman.

672
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:28,240
They cry on command.

673
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:31,940
The Weiderman twins. Don't get too
close. You'll go into sugar shock.

674
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:36,470
- Hey, isn't that--?
- Brian Neuman.

675
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:39,020
- My old partner.
- The ex-husband.

676
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,780
Who's the new wife?

677
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:44,010
Pekurovsky. Lorie Pekurovsky.

678
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:47,280
Tell me how you really feel.

679
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:52,790
Well, Kate.

680
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,660
- Surprise, surprise.
- Hello, Brian.

681
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:03,980
No wonder you've been
keeping him to yourself.

682
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:15,320
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

683
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,610
Don't worry. You'll get used to it.

684
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,230
Going down?

685
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:47,710
You talked me into it.

686
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:56,260
- Hello.
- Hey.

687
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:58,790
- How you doing?
- I'm well.

688
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,260
- See you around.
- Just get in?

689
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:03,590
- Yes.
- I thought you were napping.

690
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,060
I couldn't sleep. I wasn't tired.

691
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:13,670
He has the self-control of a rabbit.

692
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,640
Kate, what are you looking for?

693
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:17,280
Nothing. My earring.

694
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,850
I spend four years working
my way back to nationals...

695
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:22,310
...and what happens?
I'm skating to weird music...

696
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,680
...with a partner who can't even follow
the simplest of instructions.

697
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:27,950
Maybe he's got a problem sleeping.

698
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,560
The only problem that he has
is finding his zipper fast enough.

699
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:33,550
I thought they looked good together.

700
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,160
You think this is funny?
We have to skate tonight.

701
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:38,770
- Now is the time to rest.
- Like you, huh?

702
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,900
That's it. That is it.

703
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,930
Call the front desk
and get a room of your own.

704
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:49,040
I knew this wouldn't work out.
I can't even concentrate.

705
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,410
I can't even find my lucky earring.

706
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:54,940
Hello.

707
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:11,230
This hasn't got anything
to do with skating, does it?

708
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:13,960
- What does that mean?
- You're falling for him.

709
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,270
- What?
- Doug.

710
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,630
- Yes.
- You are. You're falling for him.

711
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,640
- That's crazy.
- You think so?

712
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,470
- You're nuts.
- Am l?

713
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,110
- You see how we act together.
- Yes, I do.

714
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:30,080
We never get along.
I mean, we're always fighting.

715
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,240
Foreplay.

716
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,230
- Okay, we're all in.
- You are not waiting for Hale?

717
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:51,560
He's not coming. He had to go up
to Boston. Business problems.

718
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:53,460
Is okay with you?

719
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:58,370
If you wanna worry about something,
worry about ramjet the rookie here.

720
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:00,880
Who?

721
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,110
Let's go.

722
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:10,880
So here we are at night number four
of the U.S. national championships.

723
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:13,750
The country's 12 best couples
are in the arena tonight.

724
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:16,550
Only two of these couples
will go on to the olympics...

725
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,730
...in Albertville, France
six weeks from now.

726
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,900
Tonight we're seeing
two and a half minutes...

727
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:25,630
...in the compulsory moves before
tomorrow night's long program.

728
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:49,990
You look nervous.

729
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:53,190
You look really nervous.

730
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:58,660
How nervous are you?

731
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,230
How nervous are you?

732
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,760
I feel better.

733
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:35,900
What is wrong with you?

734
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:38,870
I always get tight before a game.

735
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:41,280
Put it this way.

736
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:45,170
When I played hockey,
I used to have two helmets.

737
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:48,110
One for the game,
and one for just before.

738
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,870
This just coming up now?

739
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,140
Bad choice of words.

740
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:59,550
Beautiful skating. Just beautiful.

741
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:07,360
I don't believe this.

742
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:09,560
I'm fine. No problem.

743
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:11,600
Don't sweat it.

744
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:16,570
Look at me.

745
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:18,400
Miss Moseley, Mr. Dorsey,
you're on.

746
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,580
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes.
That's good.

747
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,910
Okay. Now smile.

748
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,670
Concentrate on my forehead.

749
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,910
Okay. Now look at me and smile.

750
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,110
There you go. There. Bigger.

751
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,150
Okay. Now breathe.

752
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,950
Breathe.

753
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:37,920
Just don't breathe on me, okay?

754
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,830
Look, it goes away.

755
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:42,520
The worst it ever was...

756
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:45,360
...I went out and scored six goals
in the first two periods.

757
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:46,540
Next to skate...

758
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:49,760
...Kate Moseley, Douglas Dorsey.

759
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:52,240
Miss Moseley, Mr. Dorsey, please.

760
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,070
You're saying once
we get out there...

761
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,750
...everything will be fine?

762
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:59,140
It usually only took me
about 10 minutes to relax.

763
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:02,180
Our program is
two and a half minutes.

764
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:06,180
So eight minutes after
we're done I'll be fine.

765
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,930
So here they are, former
U.S. champion Kate Moseley...

766
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:17,830
...and ex-hockey star Doug Dorsey
at their first nationals.

767
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:21,370
And what a place to make
your competitive debut.

768
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,160
Side by side double axels.
Here they come.

769
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,330
And they nailed them.

770
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,560
They nailed them just beautifully.

771
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:03,400
What a night for U. S. Pairs skating.
It's extraordinary.

772
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:08,050
Brian Neuman and Lorie Pekurovsky
into first place.

773
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:10,650
Johnny and Jodie Weiderman
into the number two spot.

774
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:14,550
And out of nowhere, Kate Moseley
and Doug Dorsey grab number three.

775
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,520
Two couples are all
the United States...

776
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,710
...are allowed to send
to the olympic Games.

777
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:22,490
Tomorrow night's long program
should be very exciting.

778
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,930
Man, this overnight thing is brutal.

779
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:27,600
Why can't it be a double-header?

780
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,000
Short program, long program,
same night.

781
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,760
We're out of here.
Know what I mean?

782
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:32,960
I know what you mean.

783
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:36,140
It's like, enough already. It's like....

784
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:37,810
What's the word?

785
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:39,640
You know what word
I'm looking for?

786
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:41,370
I don't know. Expectation?

787
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:43,810
- No, no. When you....
- Anticipation?

788
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:45,070
- Excitement?
- Foreplay.

789
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:49,680
- Foreplay?
- Yeah, you know. Like foreplay.

790
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:51,080
Yeah, I know what it means.

791
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:53,550
Well, wouldn't you rather
just get right to it?

792
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,750
- What?
- Skating.

793
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,900
Long program.

794
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,160
Chicago. Nationals.

795
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:03,230
Flowers?

796
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:08,700
Sleep.

797
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:10,400
I'd rather sleep.

798
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:15,980
Sleep?

799
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,160
Brian Neuman
and Lorie Pekurovsky.

800
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:32,960
Beautiful skating. This assures them
a place on the olympic team.

801
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,530
The remaining spot will
go to one of the two teams...

802
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:39,860
...Ieft to skate: Moseley-Dorsey
or the Weidermans.

803
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,670
Kate Moseley and Doug Dorsey.

804
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,570
What a performance.
Look at that sit spin.

805
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,910
This crowd knows it's seeing
history in the making.

806
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,850
We're in for a major upset tonight.

807
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,330
Oh, yes. That was great skating.

808
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:20,800
Clean, powerful,
and the crowd just loved it.

809
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,440
- Fantastic.
- Are those for me?

810
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:25,440
Hey. You were great.

811
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:29,710
5. 4, 5. 4, 5. 4....

812
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,480
These are not great marks.
I expected much higher.

813
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:34,160
Evidently, so did the crowd.

814
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,720
It's hard to explain
to people outside the sport...

815
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:39,920
...but sometimes the scores
reflect more than what's on the ice.

816
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:41,790
The judges have their favorites...

817
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,590
...and they obviously don't include
Moseley and Dorsey.

818
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,630
It looks like the Weidermans will join
Neuman and Pekurovsky...

819
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,960
...on the olympic team.

820
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:54,470
This is horseshit.

821
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:58,440
What crap are they trying to pull?
We skated our asses off out there.

822
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:00,080
You call this a sport?

823
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,870
Bullshit.

824
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:51,500
Just terrible. She stepped into
the spin, then I'm not sure...

825
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:55,170
...but it looked like she got caught
in his lederhosen.

826
01:07:55,170 --> 01:07:57,470
You know what this means.

827
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:01,840
We are in.

828
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:07,380
Yeah. Yeah. We're going to France.

829
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,170
Parlez-vous Olympics?

830
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,480
Sure you wanna do this?

831
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:16,410
Whatever you're having.

832
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:05,150
All right. We're here.

833
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:09,080
Oh, boy.

834
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:13,300
Okay.

835
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:22,630
Wanna dance?

836
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,170
No, I don't think so.

837
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:25,870
Doug.

838
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,680
Douglas, you silly thing.

839
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,010
Please don't think.

840
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:36,020
That's what I like about the way I feel.
Even if I tried to think, I couldn't.

841
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:40,280
And I think too much,
and I think so long. And it's so tiring.

842
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:44,160
The world is spinning
and spinning and spinning.

843
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:47,590
Look....

844
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,100
Did you ever play with magnets?

845
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,100
You used to have to
push them around...

846
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:58,000
...and they'd push away and
you push them around the table?

847
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:03,040
All you really had to do was
just flip them over, and suddenly....

848
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:13,050
Don't you see? That's why
everything's been so awful.

849
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:15,950
All we needed was a little flip.

850
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,920
Kate, it's not right.
What about Hale?

851
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:20,530
Oh, Hale shmale.

852
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,160
We're through.

853
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:29,130
Our engagement is off.

854
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:31,060
Flip.

855
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:54,620
Come on. Not tonight.

856
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:56,130
Not like this.

857
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:58,230
Not like what?

858
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,170
Not like me?

859
01:12:03,370 --> 01:12:06,360
- Kate, you're bombed.
- What do you mean?

860
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,380
That means that it's time
for you to go to bed.

861
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:12,810
God, just what I need.

862
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:15,110
Someone else telling me what to do.

863
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:18,750
In case you've missed it,
I am throwing myself at you.

864
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:20,610
I am tearing off my clothes...

865
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:23,810
...and you are giving me a rundown
on drinking dos and don'ts.

866
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:26,580
Kate, why don't you calm--

867
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:28,490
I get enough coaching
on the ice. Get out.

868
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:31,560
- You've got this all wrong.
- Do I ever.

869
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:36,600
Excuse my surprise, but really,
what a disappointment.

870
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:40,430
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Well, look at you.

871
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,540
God's gift to reckless abandon...

872
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:47,300
...revealed as nothing but a prude
in wolf's clothing.

873
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,270
You're a lousy drunk.

874
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,510
And you're a lousy date.

875
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:00,860
It didn't have to be like this.

876
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:04,060
I said, get out.

877
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:50,800
Hi.

878
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:53,280
I watched your program.

879
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:56,240
You've got a great sit spin.

880
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:02,110
I thought maybe
we could trade secrets.

881
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:59,210
It's a little early for practice, isn't it?

882
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:00,830
I'm sorry. I must have
the wrong room.

883
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,510
Ask her for more towels, will you?

884
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,590
Kate.

885
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:19,780
Kate.

886
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:21,980
Kate, will you wait a minute? Kate.

887
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,750
Kate.

888
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,330
Kate.

889
01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:26,930
- Kate.
- Don't. Don't even try it.

890
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:28,620
Just looking at you makes me sick.

891
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,630
To think I was coming to apologize.

892
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,360
Lorie Pekurovsky.

893
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:35,870
Were you or were you not engaged
until last night?

894
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:38,270
- Hardly the point.
- You threw me out of your room.

895
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,140
She may not have
waited much longer.

896
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:42,780
- That's not how it happened.
- Spare me the details.

897
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:44,510
- Where the hell do you get off?
- Me?

898
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:45,810
This is my fault?

899
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:48,650
From the first day, you treated me
like a hired hand.

900
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:52,450
Then one night you get drunk,
I'm supposed to thank my lucky stars?

901
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:54,820
I'm sorry. I don't downshift that fast.

902
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:57,930
- Get out of my way.
- No problem.

903
01:15:58,130 --> 01:16:01,220
I've been practicing that move
for a year and a half.

904
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:08,300
Blind date.

905
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:12,610
So we have little problem, da?

906
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:17,010
Good. We skip little problem...

907
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:20,810
...and go straight line
to big problem.

908
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:25,850
"And what is big problem, coach?"

909
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:28,990
Smilkov and Brushkin.

910
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:30,750
"Who?"

911
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,360
Smilkov and Brushkin.

912
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:37,620
Last night they win
European Championship.

913
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:40,190
Perfect scores.

914
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:44,840
Everybody's been blown away.
Contest is over.

915
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:49,530
Smilkov and Brushkin
are unbeatable.

916
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:53,970
So hello Soviet surprise package.

917
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:56,710
Goodbye gold medal.

918
01:16:57,890 --> 01:17:01,480
Of course, there is possible solution.

919
01:17:02,690 --> 01:17:07,790
But it's probably too dangerous.

920
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:21,500
Where did these come from?

921
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:23,470
For 20 years
I've been working on this.

922
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:29,010
But you know, to have skaters,
to have situation, to have desire...

923
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:30,810
...is not ready until now.

924
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:34,420
What is this?
Is this a bounce spin into a throw?

925
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:39,180
- You can't do that.
- The key to this is release.

926
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:40,450
There can be no halfway.

927
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:43,890
No. No. It's illegal.

928
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:47,960
Is gray area.

929
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:51,730
Bounce spin to a throw twist.
Then I catch her?

930
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:53,740
Well, sort of.

931
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:55,940
We can't do this.

932
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:58,240
Why not? We have all the pieces.

933
01:17:58,450 --> 01:18:00,500
We have five weeks.

934
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:02,180
The Pamchenko Twist.

935
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,980
- Absolutely not.
- Expect us to name it after you?

936
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:09,090
No, no. Is mistake.

937
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:11,880
- Ls not right time.
- This is good stuff. I can do this.

938
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:14,460
- What are you saying? I can't?
- Hey, if the shoe fits.

939
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:17,330
Hey, listen. I have been
competing for 13 years...

940
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:21,230
...and nobody tells me
what I can or cannot do.

941
01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:28,370
Don't quit your day job.

942
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:35,040
Okay, again.

943
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:37,580
Again.

944
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:38,750
Again, again.

945
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:40,610
Again. Again.

946
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,290
Katya, head up.

947
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:51,150
Higher. Higher. She has to fly.

948
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,030
- Are they gonna get it?
- Eventually.

949
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,900
Before they kill each other?

950
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,610
Release. Release must be total.

951
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:10,940
Is no halfway. Halfway is bullshit.

952
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:13,580
You go halfway, you get hurt.

953
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:24,520
Higher.

954
01:19:24,730 --> 01:19:26,560
Much higher.

955
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:30,300
We are needing an explosion.

956
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:08,630
Kate?

957
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:12,830
I was just looking at
the pictures of mother.

958
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:20,270
I can hear her now:

959
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,680
"The Olympics."

960
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:26,380
It's what she always dreamed of.

961
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:29,950
Look at this thing.

962
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:32,050
Just sitting here empty.

963
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,920
We're almost there, honey.

964
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:38,930
I can taste it.

965
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:41,190
What if it stays empty?

966
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:42,630
Not this time.

967
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:46,900
- Go to bed. You need your rest.
- I'm not tired.

968
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:48,370
- Kate.
- No.

969
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,410
What are we doing?

970
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:55,910
Why am I doing this?

971
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:59,390
It's what you've always wanted.

972
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:01,720
Always?

973
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:08,590
- Kate--
- I know.

974
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:10,420
I'm going.

975
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:14,030
These little pep-talks
can be so exhausting.

976
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:04,580
Opening ceremonies,
you enjoyed yourself?

977
01:22:04,780 --> 01:22:06,770
- Oh, it was great.
- Cold and great.

978
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:10,750
So, Doug, what's the difference
between this and hockey?

979
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:12,350
The women.

980
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:15,290
What's the feeling?
Everybody out for themselves...

981
01:22:15,490 --> 01:22:18,260
...or is there a team spirit building?

982
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:21,190
- Oh, we're definitely a team.
- Definitely.

983
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,630
There's a real sense
of togetherness.

984
01:22:23,830 --> 01:22:26,230
- Spirit.
- Spirit.

985
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:27,400
Family.

986
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:31,400
It's-- It's sort of.... It's almost....

987
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:34,340
- It's almost--
- Orgasmic.

988
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,630
What did she say?

989
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:39,980
- The Russians.
- The Russians.

990
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:41,680
Nikolai?

991
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:44,820
- Nikolai?
- Can we get a photo?

992
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:47,210
You guys gonna be here a while?

993
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:12,300
You forgot a button.

994
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:14,450
No, I like it open.

995
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:17,440
Well, it looks terrible.

996
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:19,350
It pulls at my neck.

997
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:24,390
Well, you should've
mentioned that in Chicago.

998
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:25,990
Enough.

999
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:36,160
Button it.

1000
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:38,230
We're on.

1001
01:23:40,170 --> 01:23:41,800
Good luck.

1002
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:48,010
Representing the United States
of America...

1003
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:49,180
...Moseley and Dorsey.

1004
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:53,180
- Button the goddamn button.
- Get over it.

1005
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:55,980
You are an immature asshole
of the lowest order.

1006
01:23:57,260 --> 01:23:59,420
If it was 40 below and that button...

1007
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:01,750
...meant the difference
between a long life...

1008
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,860
...and a horrible death
from hypothermia...

1009
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:06,620
...I still wouldn't give you
the satisfaction.

1010
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:09,470
Skate.

1011
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,160
A technically superior program...

1012
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:38,450
...but did you feel
there was something missing?

1013
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:41,560
Absolutely. They delivered all
the short-program required moves...

1014
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,100
...but it seemed very cold.

1015
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:46,330
As if we were seeing two strangers,
rather than a fluid pair.

1016
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:50,240
It just didn't look like
they were having fun out there.

1017
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:54,210
Hey, Doug...

1018
01:24:54,410 --> 01:24:57,280
- ...was the altitude a problem tonight?
- No.

1019
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:03,610
Long program. We've been hearing all
week about your new surprise move.

1020
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:06,310
- What's it called?
- The Pamchenko.

1021
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:09,350
- The Pamchenko. Is it named after--?
- We're not doing it.

1022
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:11,580
- What?
- We're taking it out of the program.

1023
01:25:11,790 --> 01:25:13,490
It's not ready.

1024
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,690
Doug?

1025
01:25:18,770 --> 01:25:20,290
A button?

1026
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,370
- What in hell are you thinking of?
- Me?

1027
01:25:22,570 --> 01:25:24,400
Yes, you. What the hell
is in your head?

1028
01:25:24,610 --> 01:25:26,100
He's making like this is my fault.

1029
01:25:26,310 --> 01:25:28,710
You didn't deliver.
What, you want a pat on the back?

1030
01:25:28,910 --> 01:25:30,670
When did I become
the designated asshole?

1031
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,280
What happened?
Ask the ice queen.

1032
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:35,780
- Enough of that.
- When you're done, Jack...

1033
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:40,420
...you can tell me why I spent 5 weeks
on a move she was never gonna do.

1034
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:42,650
- You're out of line.
- I needed the gold medal.

1035
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:44,650
Forget it.
We can win without the move.

1036
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:47,690
- Lmpossible.
- Where the hell were you during this?

1037
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:50,190
Where was l? I was babysitting.

1038
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,060
Loud and clear, folks:
Losing gracefully does nothing for me.

1039
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:57,070
- Think about that in the future.
- That what you told Brian in Calgary?

1040
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:02,040
You can kid all you want about
what happened. I've seen the tapes.

1041
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,040
Brian was getting it done.

1042
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,670
Ask him. He'll tell you.

1043
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:09,940
All right, Douglas, is enough.

1044
01:26:10,150 --> 01:26:11,380
Today it's about a button.

1045
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:14,050
You people are all excuses.
You wanna point a finger--

1046
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:16,910
- You goddamn son of a bitch.
- Gotta find that go-to guy.

1047
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,090
You should've started
with a go-to girl, Jack.

1048
01:26:19,290 --> 01:26:20,550
- That cuts it.
- He's right.

1049
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,090
What?

1050
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:24,430
He's right. He is.

1051
01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:29,130
All of it.

1052
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:35,060
We worked so hard for two years.
And I just went and threw it all away.

1053
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,810
- Why did you stay with me?
- Kate, don't.

1054
01:26:48,450 --> 01:26:50,390
Don't what?

1055
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:53,120
Tell the truth?

1056
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:57,320
We can't buy back
what happened today.

1057
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:01,130
We can't start over.

1058
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:04,460
Do you think I look at myself,
at what I've become...

1059
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:06,600
...and do you think I'm proud?

1060
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,070
What do you want?

1061
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:12,670
I don't know.

1062
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:17,640
I guess I would like to go back
to the beginning and have you say...

1063
01:27:18,850 --> 01:27:21,750
...win or lose,
I could just be your daughter.

1064
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:29,020
You came every day,
and you skated.

1065
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,890
This must've been
like a nightmare for you.

1066
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:43,500
I didn't know it was gonna
end up like this.

1067
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:51,540
I'm sorry.

1068
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:59,350
I'm so sorry. For everything.

1069
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:06,290
Please excuse me.

1070
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:18,860
I'm going for a walk.

1071
01:29:42,820 --> 01:29:45,650
Kate. What's this?

1072
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:52,400
I'm going over with my father.
Anton has the other car.

1073
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:54,300
He'll take you over
when you're ready to go.

1074
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:58,130
- No, I'm talking about the bags.
- I'm catching the 6:30 flight tonight.

1075
01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:00,600
Tonight? After we skate?

1076
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,460
The house is paid up
for two weeks...

1077
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:05,700
- ...so stay as long as you like.
- Kate, wait. What are you saying?

1078
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:08,710
- Lf this is about yesterday--
- I'm retiring.

1079
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:13,370
What?

1080
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:19,320
This afternoon is my final skate.

1081
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:22,520
- Kate, come on--
- You'll be fine.

1082
01:30:24,190 --> 01:30:26,790
You won't have any trouble
finding another partner.

1083
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:34,200
Of course, they won't have
my wonderful slap shot.

1084
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:38,260
I gotta go get ready.

1085
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:34,050
Beautiful extension.
Very classy.

1086
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:35,660
Executed very nicely.

1087
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:38,620
I hope they can keep it
going to the finish.

1088
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:53,840
Neuman and Pekurovsky
looking well-positioned for a medal.

1089
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:57,540
Still to skate are Smilkov-Brushkin
and Kate Moseley and Doug Dorsey.

1090
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:13,000
Do you know what I think
would be wonderful?

1091
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:18,130
If you would go out there today
and skate for these people...

1092
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:21,070
...the way I have seen you skate.

1093
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:26,740
Enjoy each other.

1094
01:32:52,630 --> 01:32:55,100
What's the matter?

1095
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:56,270
Nothing.

1096
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:59,370
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

1097
01:33:10,950 --> 01:33:12,720
Kate, I'm sorry.

1098
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:15,410
My timing--
I know it stinks, but....

1099
01:33:15,620 --> 01:33:17,780
I just keep thinking
this thing with us....

1100
01:33:17,990 --> 01:33:19,250
It's gonna go away.

1101
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:22,400
I keep thinking if I can just keep
moving and checking...

1102
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,900
...I'll get clear, but....

1103
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:26,960
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

1104
01:33:28,170 --> 01:33:31,370
- I don't wanna fight anymore.
- No. I mean, yeah, I don't wanna fight.

1105
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:33,870
- Look, we have to skate.
- This won't wait.

1106
01:33:34,070 --> 01:33:36,240
Kate, maybe I wasn't ready.
Maybe--

1107
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:38,670
Maybe you didn't give me much
of a chance. Maybe--

1108
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,750
I don't know. I just-- I just--

1109
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:43,540
Nine-six.
Nine-three.

1110
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:49,650
Kate, somewhere in the middle
of all this I fell in love with you.

1111
01:33:51,730 --> 01:33:54,190
You may take the ice.

1112
01:33:54,390 --> 01:33:58,060
I'm saying I love you.
I'm saying it out loud.

1113
01:34:11,110 --> 01:34:12,940
Don't say we're not right
for each other...

1114
01:34:13,150 --> 01:34:15,240
...because we may not be right
for anybody else.

1115
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:18,810
- You have to go on.
- Will you shut up a minute.

1116
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:22,110
It can't be any harder to stay together
than it was to stay apart.

1117
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,260
- Thirty seconds.
- Will you wait a minute.

1118
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:28,250
Kate.

1119
01:34:29,190 --> 01:34:31,490
I need you.

1120
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:35,660
I need you.

1121
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:49,310
We're doing the Pamchenko.

1122
01:34:50,050 --> 01:34:52,240
- What?
- Oh, you heard me.

1123
01:34:53,450 --> 01:34:55,610
Think I'm doing this
to get a program out of you?

1124
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:57,220
You wanna win, don't you?

1125
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:59,820
No. It's no good, Kate.
It's too dangerous.

1126
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:03,220
Then we agreed.
We're putting it in.

1127
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:08,930
- It's out.
- It's in.

1128
01:35:09,130 --> 01:35:10,120
- Out.
- Ln.

1129
01:35:10,330 --> 01:35:11,600
- Out.
- Ln.

1130
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,340
- What difference does it make?
- The difference is...

1131
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:19,030
...I'm in the mood to kick a little ass.

1132
01:37:03,910 --> 01:37:06,640
- You didn't have to.
- Yes, I did.

1133
01:37:07,510 --> 01:37:09,040
Why?

1134
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:12,150
Because I love you.

1135
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:17,350
Just remember
who said it first.

1135
01:37:18,305 --> 01:37:24,926
