00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,334
Good morning, granny.

3
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,133
Good morning, Kitty.

4
00:02:11,734 --> 00:02:12,968
Ha ha ha!

5
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:20,334
Here you are,
Darling.

6
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,167
But it's saturday,
Granny.

7
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:23,834
Oh, so it is.

8
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:25,601
And you'll be late.

9
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:28,067
Mmm, but I'm trying
To be late, granny.

10
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:30,000
You should be
About an hour late, really.

11
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,701
Often I would be
Two hours late,

12
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:35,300
And a young man
Would be very anxious.

13
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:41,701
Not my young man.
Just wouldn't wait.

14
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:45,868
Have you got
My secret safe?

15
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:47,367
Oh, quite safe.

16
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,667
Yes, here it is.

17
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:54,534
Do you know what I'm
Going to do with this?

18
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:55,801
Give it to Gerald.

19
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:58,033
I am not.
It's for Alan.

20
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,634
Oh, you knew it
All the time.

21
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:02,634
Poor Gerald.

22
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:04,334
Doesn't he get anything?

23
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,801
No. It's for Alan,
And I'm going to marry him.

24
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:09,501
Look, look, Kitty.
Look.

25
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:12,567
Granny!

26
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:14,567
Hold the nest
While I dress.

27
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:16,367
I will be late.

28
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:29,567
Good morning, father.

29
00:03:30,901 --> 00:03:32,000
Good morning,
Darling.

30
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:33,334
Good morning,
Aunt Josephine.

31
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,667
Good morning,
Kitty.

32
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:36,000
Good morning,
Lawrence.

33
00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:39,868
Goodbye,
Aunt josephine.

34
00:03:39,934 --> 00:03:42,200
Goodbye, Kitty.
Have a good time.

35
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:44,100
I will!

36
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:45,868
Take good care
Of yourself!

37
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,534
I will!

38
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:49,033
Goodbye, darling!

39
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,567
Goodbye!

40
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,200
Must we have
A draft, Henry?

41
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,968
I believe in children eating
Their breakfast at home.

42
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:06,133
Well, Lawrence
Is at home.

43
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,801
Yes.

44
00:04:07,868 --> 00:04:10,467
Lawrence is at home.
And why?

45
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:13,501
Because the shannons don't
Condescend to ask him over with Kitty.

46
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:16,667
Come, josephine. Don't
Imagine those foolish things.

47
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:19,334
Of course Mrs. Shannon
Knows I'm penniless

48
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,033
And Lawrence
Hasn't a father.

49
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,000
Considering that she
Adopted Alan trent,

50
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:25,834
Who has neither
A father nor a mother,

51
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:27,501
And brought him
All the way from canada,

52
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,167
That doesn't seem
Very likely.

53
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:31,000
Alan was
Her sister's son,

54
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:34,300
But my poor Lawrence
Isn't good enough for them.

55
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,667
I don't want to go,
Anyway.

56
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:39,467
Not a bit. So there.

57
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:44,300
Good morning.
Good morning, martin.

58
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,100
The master's started prayers,
Miss Kitty, but good morning.

59
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:49,467
Am I awfully late?
I'm afraid so.

60
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:52,334
Down, Peter, down.
Come along, Miss Kitty.

61
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,033
They'll dirty
My frock!

62
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:08,968
Oh, lord,
Our heavenly father,

63
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:12,300
Almighty and everlasting god,

64
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:15,334
To whose watchful
Providence we owe it...

65
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,200
...that no...

66
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:32,868
To whose watchful providence
We owe it that-

67
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:37,534
Good morning!

68
00:05:40,234 --> 00:05:41,300
Morning!

69
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:43,834
To whose watchful providence
We owe it

70
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:46,868
That no disturbance
Has come nigh to us.

71
00:05:46,934 --> 00:05:49,667
Look, Alan.
It's a bird's nest.

72
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:51,200
I found it
Under my tree.

73
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,801
I brought it for you.

74
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:56,033
It's only
A moldy sparrow's nest.

75
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,367
The mother's deserted it
Ages ago.

76
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:00,033
Can I have it,
Kitty?

77
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,701
Yes, Gerald,
You can.

78
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:03,534
Humbly
Beseeching thee to accept...

79
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:07,801
Praying for dogs-

80
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,300
That's what it amounts to.

81
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:11,467
Morning service
For the dogs.

82
00:06:11,534 --> 00:06:14,400
Have the kidneys very hot.
Very hot.

83
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:20,200
Kitty, next saturday
I hope you'll be kind enough

84
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:22,200
To bring your horse
In with you.

85
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:25,634
I should like to have the
Entire animal world with us,

86
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:27,133
Like noah's ark.

87
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,834
I suppose you didn't bring that
Moth-eaten bird's nest with you.

88
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,834
Oh, Alan,
I'm so sorry.

89
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:46,334
I left it at home.

90
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,133
That's all right. I might
Have carried these eggs in it.

91
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:50,667
It doesn't matter.

92
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:09,934
What was that?

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,467
Just a gust of wind.

94
00:07:11,534 --> 00:07:13,300
But it came up so quick.

95
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,300
Look!
There's nothing now.

96
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,133
Maybe it was
A whirlwind.

97
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,133
That wasn't
A whirlwind.

98
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,801
It wasn't a wind
At all.

99
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:24,934
It was a warning...
A warning.

100
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,434
You're barmy.

101
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:28,434
I told you not to have
A third sausage roll.

102
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:30,801
Well, I'm gonna look
For some more eggs.

103
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,501
I'm much too full
To argue.

104
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:34,501
Oh, and if you get
Any more warnings,

105
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:36,601
Let me know.

106
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:39,834
Tell me, Alan,
What was this warning of?

107
00:07:39,901 --> 00:07:41,667
It wasn't a warning
At all, silly.

108
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:43,834
I made that up
To keep Gerald in his place.

109
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:46,167
He shows off a bit because
He's older than I am.

110
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:49,167
It was a warning
All the same,

111
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:51,234
A special warning
Just for you and me.

112
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,501
That wind said
That we ought to get married.

113
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:56,167
I told you we ought.
I've said so lots of times.

114
00:07:56,234 --> 00:07:59,167
Now, we're not going to start
That marriage business over again.

115
00:07:59,234 --> 00:08:00,934
But you promised
To let me know.

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,267
I can't waste
The best years of my life

117
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:04,968
Just waiting for you.

118
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:06,467
Look here, Kitty.

119
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:09,133
I'll make up my mind soon.
Very soon.

120
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,467
How soon?

121
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:13,133
Oh. In about a week.

122
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,634
All right.
I'll give you a week more.

123
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:17,467
Do you think
You'll say yes?

124
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:18,968
Oh, I daresay.

125
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,934
There's no one else
To marry, is there?

126
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,601
Now what's the matter?

127
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:29,267
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

128
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:32,467
Smile.
Come on, now, smile.

129
00:08:32,534 --> 00:08:35,467
Look, Kitty, if you
Smile, I'll marry you.

130
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:36,567
How's that?

131
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:39,834
Let's go and get
Some more eggs.

132
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:40,868
All right.

133
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:48,868
Good morning, granny.
Good morning, darling.

134
00:09:57,567 --> 00:09:58,834
You're early.

135
00:09:58,901 --> 00:10:00,567
It's saturday, granny.

136
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,434
A big saturday, too,
Isn't it?

137
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:04,868
The biggest ever.

138
00:10:06,334 --> 00:10:07,300
Granny...

139
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,167
At first, seeing them
As soldiers was fun,

140
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:19,033
And I suppose I never really
Thought they'd be going away.

141
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,534
But now, I'm frightened.

142
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:24,534
I know.

143
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:26,868
Don't let them know
That you're frightened, dear.

144
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:29,534
No. Of course I won't.

145
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:32,067
Anyway, they've promised me
They'll be back very soon.

146
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,067
Granny...

147
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:40,534
I wish I knew...
I wish I were really sure...

148
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:41,868
You're not?

149
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:45,534
No.

150
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:48,367
When you love so hard
And for so long,

151
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:49,834
You can never
Really be sure.

152
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,234
And it used to be
So easy, granny!

153
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,033
I'd just ask him
To marry me...

154
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:57,567
But now...

155
00:10:57,634 --> 00:10:59,567
It's growing up, granny,
That's what it is.

156
00:10:59,634 --> 00:11:01,167
Things aren't
So simple anymore.

157
00:11:01,234 --> 00:11:05,000
I can't just say, "Alan,
Please marry me, quick."

158
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:06,167
Why not?

159
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:07,834
That's the best way
To do it.

160
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,667
Saves a lot of time!

161
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:11,334
I'll bet that's
Just what you'd do.

162
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,667
Heavens, look at the time!
I must fly!

163
00:11:13,734 --> 00:11:15,167
You're going to be early
Again.

164
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:17,601
Am I?
How dreadful.

165
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:20,667
Yes, I suppose
I always will be.

166
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:22,000
Goodbye, granny.

167
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:23,767
Goodbye, darling.

168
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:26,133
Best love
To Alan and Gerald.

169
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,868
Good morning, father.

170
00:11:39,934 --> 00:11:41,033
Morning, darling.

171
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,167
Good morning,
Aunt josephine.

172
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,701
Good morning,
Kitty.

173
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:45,534
Good morning, Lawrence. Morning.

174
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:47,067
Goodbye, father.
Goodbye, dear.

175
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:48,534
Goodbye, aunt josephine.
Goodbye, Lawrence.

176
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:50,033
No speeding, mind.

177
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,968
You've loads of time.

178
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,033
My regards
To the boys.

179
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,434
I will.

180
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:03,167
Isn't it about time Kitty
Became engaged

181
00:12:03,234 --> 00:12:05,334
To one or the other
Of those young men?

182
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,667
Perhaps she
Hasn't been asked.

183
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:07,734
Ha ha ha!

184
00:12:07,801 --> 00:12:09,534
Well, she can't go wrong.

185
00:12:09,601 --> 00:12:12,834
Fine boys, both of them.
Good stuff in those boys.

186
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:15,334
I suppose that's a dig
At my poor Lawrence.

187
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,701
Oh, nonsense,
Josephine.

188
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,834
The canteens are
Just as necessary as...

189
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:20,834
It's most unfair
And unkind.

190
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:24,167
You know very well Lawrence
Would have joined the infantry

191
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:26,000
If it hadn't been
For his hammertoe.

192
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:28,767
Mother, can't you forget
About my hammertoe?

193
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:32,701
Morning, Miss Kitty.

194
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:34,434
Morning, martin.

195
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:36,701
Poor old Peter.

196
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:38,367
He's a very old dog,
Isn't he?

197
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:39,734
Peter's 14, Miss.

198
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,934
That's 98,
Humanly speaking.

199
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,300
He's outlived his master
By two years.

200
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,868
Hello, Kitty.

201
00:12:58,934 --> 00:13:00,467
Hello, Kitty.
Good morning.

202
00:13:06,734 --> 00:13:07,901
Good morning.

203
00:13:07,968 --> 00:13:08,901
Well!

204
00:13:08,968 --> 00:13:10,033
What?

205
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,667
The new uniforms.
Let me look at you.

206
00:13:12,734 --> 00:13:14,334
Stand back
From the table.

207
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,934
Farther.

208
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,667
Turn round
And let me see you.

209
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:21,567
Like to see me
In profile?

210
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,567
Gerald,
You do look handsome.

211
00:13:26,634 --> 00:13:28,334
I'm in profile.

212
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,400
You know, I think
Gerald's coat fits better.

213
00:13:32,901 --> 00:13:34,501
I just can't find words
To express you.

214
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,868
Come, children,
Breakfast is getting cold.

215
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,534
And you'll need neckties,
And handkerchiefs,

216
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:45,133
And plenty of books-

217
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,868
You think we shall have
Much time for reading?

218
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:49,300
And a dinner coat.
We each have a new one.

219
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:51,868
An opera coat, and a violin,
And keats' sonnets.

220
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:54,767
Whenever there's a raid, we'll
Have to get all dressed up.

221
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,667
Certainly. The enemy
Won't like us if we don't.

222
00:13:58,734 --> 00:14:01,300
Oh, Gerald, do make him
Have a haircut once a month.

223
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:03,133
He's so dreadful
Without one.

224
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,767
"captain Gerald shannon,"
Says the colonel,

225
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:07,467
"look at your friend
And relative lieutenant trent.

226
00:14:07,534 --> 00:14:09,767
A disgrace!
Three hairs too long!"

227
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:12,000
Mother, don't you want
To come to London with us?

228
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,667
No, darling,
I don't like goodbyes.

229
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:16,334
Well, it's time.

230
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,033
We must be going.

231
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,000
Well, we-we'll be
Home soon, mother.

232
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:36,000
What are those funny-looking
Things you're lugging around?

233
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:38,501
You'll be glad to get
Those funny-looking things.

234
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:40,000
One's for you,

235
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:41,167
And one's for Gerald.

236
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,501
There's a book
To read on the train,

237
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:46,534
A sweater,
And some cigarettes.

238
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:47,701
The wrong kind?

239
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:49,534
No, ungrateful.
The right kind.

240
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:51,100
Thank you, Kitty.

241
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:53,701
And socks, too.
Three pairs for each of you.

242
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,367
Good warm ones.

243
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:57,934
I- I knitted them myself.

244
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,200
You made them
Yourself?

245
00:14:59,267 --> 00:15:00,367
She's been busy
On them for days.

246
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:02,133
Then we certainly
Can't wear them.

247
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,467
Much too good for his
Feet. I'll wear them all.

248
00:15:04,534 --> 00:15:07,501
Nothing like going into battle
With six pairs of socks on.

249
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:09,968
Everything in,
Martin?

250
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:11,300
Yes,
Mr. Alan.

251
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:12,467
Goodbye.

252
00:15:12,534 --> 00:15:13,567
Goodbye,
Sir.

253
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:14,601
Goodbye, martin.

254
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:15,801
Goodbye, Mr. Gerald,

255
00:15:15,868 --> 00:15:17,434
And good luck, sir.

256
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:20,000
And take care of the ladies, won't you?

257
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:22,000
Yes. I will.

258
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:25,667
Well, mother.
I know.

259
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:28,667
Remember the prayers grandfather
Used to say at breakfast?

260
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:30,334
I'm going to
Say one now.

261
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:33,000
God bless my boys

262
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:34,667
And bring them
Back to me.

263
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:39,701
God bless my boys
And bring them back to me.

264
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:41,567
Bring them back
To us both,

265
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:44,501
For a long
And happy life.

266
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:45,834
I'm going in now.

267
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:47,834
I don't want
To see you go.

268
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:49,667
My love
Goes with you.

269
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:53,767
Come along,
Gerald.

270
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:54,868
Goodbye, darling.

271
00:15:54,934 --> 00:15:57,200
Stay with her today.

272
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:00,367
Now, Alan, be careful.
Don't-

273
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:01,801
I know, I know.

274
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:03,801
You've been telling me
What not to do

275
00:16:03,868 --> 00:16:05,467
Since we were babies.

276
00:16:05,534 --> 00:16:06,968
You be a good girl.

277
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,467
You'll write?

278
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,167
Picture postcards
From every town.

279
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:15,467
You be a good girl,

280
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:19,200
And we'll buy you
A present in paris.

281
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,467
Goodbye, Gerald dear.

282
00:16:22,534 --> 00:16:23,801
Goodbye, Kitty.
Goodbye.

283
00:16:23,868 --> 00:16:25,667
You'll write me letters?

284
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,868
Yes. Long letters.

285
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,501
God bless my boys

286
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:51,200
And bring them back to me.

287
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:45,267
The train's
20 minutes late.

288
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:46,834
20 entire minutes!

289
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:50,234
After 11 months of waiting,
That's really not so long.

290
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,501
It's 20 minutes too long.
Time out of our lives.

291
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:54,033
Good time.

292
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:57,667
Do you-do you think
They'll be the same,

293
00:17:57,734 --> 00:17:59,033
Look the same?

294
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,601
I think we shall
Recognize them.

295
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:03,000
We saw them
For so many years.

296
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:19,634
There they are!
There they are!

297
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,467
Gerald!
Alan!

298
00:18:23,534 --> 00:18:24,801
Kitty!

299
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:26,801
Alan!
Kitty!

300
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:28,100
Alan!

301
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:30,968
It's all right, darling.
We're home.

302
00:18:31,033 --> 00:18:33,133
For 10 whole days.

303
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:36,133
Look at her, Gerald!

304
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,167
She's really quite pretty!

305
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:39,167
Gerald!

306
00:18:39,234 --> 00:18:40,901
Alan!
Aunt Sheila!

307
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:42,367
You're home!

308
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:45,000
Oh, I'm so glad
To see you again.

309
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:46,667
And you really are here.

310
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:48,634
It really is
Aunt Kitty again?

311
00:18:48,701 --> 00:18:50,000
You are prettier,
You know.

312
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:51,334
They both are!

313
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,834
We'll have to take them
To London

314
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:54,267
To show them off!

315
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,501
Have you lots to eat,
Aunt Sheila?

316
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:57,834
We're hungry as bears.

317
00:18:57,901 --> 00:18:58,834
Oh, plenty.

318
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,167
Mmm. Sorry.

319
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:20,834
There you are.

320
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:25,334
Thank you.

321
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:31,000
Now...

322
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:34,467
That was luncheon.

323
00:19:34,534 --> 00:19:36,133
Now, um...

324
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,133
Can we have dinner
Right away, aunt Sheila?

325
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,200
And a spot of supper
Right after that?

326
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:43,434
Are you two going to spend
The whole 10 days eating?

327
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:45,033
We decided on it
Months ago.

328
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,834
Eating, sleeping, bathing.
Eating, sleeping, bathing.

329
00:19:47,901 --> 00:19:50,501
Maybe we could think of some way
Of eating while we're sleeping.

330
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:52,968
We haven't thought about
This thing enough, Gerald.

331
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:54,334
Very dull,
Aren't they?

332
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,701
Very dull indeed.

333
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:58,000
When was the last time
You ate, pig?

334
00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:00,334
From the pure, white hands
Of your cousin,

335
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,334
Lawrence Bidley.

336
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,834
We hadn't seen england for 11
Months, and our first sight of it

337
00:20:04,901 --> 00:20:08,000
Had to be Lawrence Bidley with
A thermos bottle in his hand.

338
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:09,501
Gerald wanted
To turn back.

339
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:12,234
Said you meet a better class
Of people in the trenches.

340
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,834
Kitty and I had planned
Some things

341
00:20:13,901 --> 00:20:15,667
We thought
You might like to do.

342
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:17,167
Had you?
Let's hear them.

343
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:19,000
First of all,
Lunch at the restons.

344
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:20,667
And on friday,

345
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:22,534
The vicar is having
A fete for the red cross.

346
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:24,534
Well, that
Needn't trouble us.

347
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:26,934
I'm afraid he hopes
You'll open it.

348
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,968
Did you tell him
I would?

349
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:31,033
Your mother didn't quite
Like to go as far as that.

350
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,234
I think that Gerald
Ought to open it.

351
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,868
Then, on
Saturday afternoon,

352
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,367
There's a concert

353
00:20:37,434 --> 00:20:39,100
In aid of
The cottage hospital.

354
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:41,868
And on saturday evening,
We shall both go there.

355
00:20:41,934 --> 00:20:44,067
This is worse
Than the war.

356
00:20:45,934 --> 00:20:46,901
Well...

357
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:49,200
Speaking of hot water.

358
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:50,701
How about a long...

359
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:52,534
...hot bath!

360
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:58,067
You can both come and talk
Through the door if you like.

361
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,334
We'll wait.

362
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:02,834
It's lovely having them
Home again, isn't it?

363
00:21:02,901 --> 00:21:04,834
I've missed them both
Terribly.

364
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:07,834
Well, I'll see you all
At dinner.

365
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:09,501
You're not
Staying with us?

366
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:12,000
They'll be out of those
Baths in an hour or two.

367
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:14,367
They'll want to
See you alone.

368
00:21:14,434 --> 00:21:16,334
Kitty, they'll want to
See you alone.

369
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,834
They came home for that.

370
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:21,167
I've wanted to say this
For a long time.

371
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:23,367
They both love you
Very much.

372
00:21:23,434 --> 00:21:25,701
I love them, too.

373
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:28,033
Yes, but Kitty...

374
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,868
I want you to know, dear,

375
00:21:29,934 --> 00:21:32,868
That whichever you choose,
I shall understand.

376
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:34,534
You've always
Understood.

377
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:36,067
You've been a darling.

378
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:40,567
Goodbye, Peter.

379
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:54,234
Where are you going?

380
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:57,067
Want a piece of cake?

381
00:21:57,133 --> 00:22:00,067
No, I'm going home.
I'm tired of seeing you eat.

382
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:01,667
Wait a minute!

383
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:03,133
We'll come with you.

384
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,767
Maybe there's something new
To eat at your house.

385
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:07,334
Hey, wait a minute!

386
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,334
No. Goodbye.

387
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,367
Say, Kitty.

388
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,100
Look. If you don't wait,
I'll jump.

389
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,534
Go back in, idiot.

390
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:17,834
Will you wait for me?

391
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:19,367
No.

392
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,267
Alan!

393
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:28,501
Alan, darling, you're not hurt, are you?

394
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:32,534
Alan, darling. Alan.

395
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:44,734
Clown.

396
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:51,901
Are you cross
That I'm not hurt?

397
00:22:51,968 --> 00:22:54,000
I did scratch my hand.

398
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:56,033
It's serious. I think that's the
Way you get leprosy or something.

399
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,334
Good.

400
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,701
You've changed.
You're so bloodthirsty.

401
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:01,667
And you,
You haven't changed.

402
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:03,968
You're still a child.
You don't feel it.

403
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:06,167
What don't I feel?

404
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:07,834
You don't feel anything.
You don't-

405
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:09,834
Don't I?

406
00:23:09,901 --> 00:23:11,834
How do you know what I feel?

407
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:14,167
You know about
The months I've been away,

408
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:16,834
The agony I've been through
Because of you?

409
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:18,667
You know how frightened
I was of coming home

410
00:23:18,734 --> 00:23:20,367
And finding
That you had changed,

411
00:23:20,434 --> 00:23:23,801
That you didn't feel... The
Things I wanted you to feel?

412
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,634
How frightened I am now
Of saying what I want...

413
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:32,667
Look here.
I can't say it all.

414
00:23:32,734 --> 00:23:34,467
Maybe I can't say
Any part of it

415
00:23:34,534 --> 00:23:35,801
Because I'm scared.

416
00:23:35,868 --> 00:23:37,167
But Kitty...

417
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,667
Kitty, I-
I've so much love for you.

418
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:47,534
It's like something you've
Saved up for a lifetime

419
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:49,033
And didn't know about,

420
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,667
Then it all comes at once.

421
00:23:52,267 --> 00:23:53,234
Alan...

422
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:58,200
Alan, darling.

423
00:23:58,267 --> 00:24:01,968
I've wanted to hear you
Say that so much.

424
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:04,133
Darling,
Surely you knew.

425
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,133
I wasn't sure.

426
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,067
You see, I've always
Been around...

427
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:10,734
I know.

428
00:24:10,801 --> 00:24:12,667
When I first looked through
The bars of my crib,

429
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:14,501
There you were,
Telling me what to do.

430
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:16,334
I was not.

431
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,667
When I saw my first tree,
You were in it, peering down.

432
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:21,167
My first bird
And my first squirrel,

433
00:24:21,234 --> 00:24:22,501
My first bath,

434
00:24:22,567 --> 00:24:24,234
You were always there.

435
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:27,501
That's what
Makes me afraid.

436
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,968
You may be just used to me.

437
00:24:31,067 --> 00:24:32,567
You may meet some girl...

438
00:24:32,634 --> 00:24:34,667
Why, you sweet idiot.

439
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:37,000
Don't ever say that.

440
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:39,501
There'll be no one else,
Ever.

441
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:41,667
I've tried, my darling.
It isn't any good.

442
00:24:41,734 --> 00:24:44,000
If ever you weren't there,

443
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,934
I'd stop living.

444
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,534
I'd stop breathing.

445
00:24:47,601 --> 00:24:50,100
I'd stop
Wanting to breathe.

446
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:53,968
Don't ever stop watching me,
My darling.

447
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:56,300
Don't ever go away.

448
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,133
We must tell
Aunt Sheila.

449
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,567
And father.
Come on.

450
00:25:08,701 --> 00:25:10,467
Wait a minute! What are we
Going to tell them?

451
00:25:10,534 --> 00:25:11,801
That we're going
To be married.

452
00:25:11,868 --> 00:25:13,367
But when?
Day after tomorrow?

453
00:25:13,434 --> 00:25:16,067
Tomorrow.
Why, you shameless hussy!

454
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:19,701
Aunt Sheila!

455
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:32,300
So it's finally happened,
After all these years.

456
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,033
Congratulations.

457
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,400
Gerald!

458
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:40,367
Gerald, dear.

459
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,000
All my love, Kitty,

460
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:44,667
For you both.

461
00:25:44,734 --> 00:25:46,167
Congratulations,
Alan.

462
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:47,434
Thanks, Gerald.

463
00:25:47,501 --> 00:25:49,167
Oh, this is
The way it should be.

464
00:25:49,234 --> 00:25:50,734
I'm happy about it.

465
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:51,868
Mother!

466
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:53,434
Mother, come here!

467
00:25:54,734 --> 00:25:55,968
We've news for you.

468
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:58,167
These two have
Gotten themselves engaged.

469
00:25:58,234 --> 00:25:59,701
We're getting married
Tomorrow.

470
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,334
Darling,
That's splendid.

471
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,267
I'm very happy.

472
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:06,634
I know
You will be,

473
00:26:06,701 --> 00:26:07,801
Both of you.

474
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,300
We shall all
Be together now.

475
00:26:11,367 --> 00:26:12,434
Always.

476
00:26:13,868 --> 00:26:15,534
Do you mind
If I run?

477
00:26:15,601 --> 00:26:17,300
I can't wait
To tell father.

478
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,133
I think you ought
To come with me.

479
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,467
I fully intend to.

480
00:26:20,534 --> 00:26:22,234
We'll be back.

481
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:31,634
It's all right, mother.

482
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:36,167
Gerald,
This came a moment ago.

483
00:26:36,234 --> 00:26:37,501
It's for you.

484
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:39,834
I took it from a boy
In the drive.

485
00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:41,501
I do hope...

486
00:26:45,234 --> 00:26:47,834
We've got to go back.

487
00:26:47,901 --> 00:26:50,467
We're going out from folkestone
Early tomorrow morning.

488
00:26:50,534 --> 00:26:52,100
Oh, Gerald, no.

489
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:54,334
Must be a big push on.
All leaves been cancelled.

490
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,000
Those poor children.

491
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:58,334
They wanted
To be married.

492
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,534
Yes.

493
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:02,334
I shall have to tell them.

494
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:07,467
So there's no chance?
Nothing we can do?

495
00:27:07,534 --> 00:27:08,968
There must
Be some way.

496
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:10,968
You've known us
Since we were children.

497
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:13,300
This means so much
To us now.

498
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:15,667
There may
Never be...

499
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:19,968
I know.
I'm sorry.

500
00:27:20,033 --> 00:27:23,868
Two hours ago, you might have
Secured a special license.

501
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,467
Now... It's too late.

502
00:27:26,534 --> 00:27:28,133
I know how you feel,

503
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,467
But try to see that
Alan will be back soon,

504
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:31,968
And you'll be
Married here.

505
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:36,501
We'll arrange it beforehand,
And... It won't be long.

506
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,634
Who knows
How long it'll be?

507
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:42,701
Thank you anyhow.

508
00:27:44,234 --> 00:27:46,000
You've been
Very patient with us.

509
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:48,334
God bless you

510
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,501
And bring you
Back to this church,

511
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:52,334
To the marriage
That you want.

512
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,033
Thank you.

513
00:28:06,868 --> 00:28:07,968
Well, Kitty,

514
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:09,834
Nobody will marry us.

515
00:28:11,868 --> 00:28:13,634
After all these years,

516
00:28:13,701 --> 00:28:16,000
We were two hours too late.

517
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:21,334
And I wanted that for us
So much.

518
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,801
Two hours, Kitty.

519
00:28:24,868 --> 00:28:27,834
Two hours that would have
Changed our lives.

520
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,300
No. They're not going to
Change our lives.

521
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:39,534
Alan, we don't need
Anyone to marry us.

522
00:28:41,567 --> 00:28:43,701
I'm going to folkestone
With you.

523
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:48,300
Darling.

524
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:59,501
I marry you, Alan trent,

525
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:01,300
In front of a church.

526
00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:08,767
And I marry you,
Kitty Vane,

527
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:11,100
For always...

528
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:14,334
Until the day I die.

529
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:56,167
This is
The only room we have.

530
00:29:56,234 --> 00:29:58,000
I think you'll
Find it comfortable.

531
00:29:58,067 --> 00:29:59,501
This will do
Splendidly.

532
00:30:05,901 --> 00:30:08,634
We have to keep the curtains drawn
When there's a light in the room.

533
00:30:08,701 --> 00:30:11,334
We must be very careful these
Nights when there's no moon.

534
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,467
What was that?

535
00:30:24,534 --> 00:30:26,067
The guns.

536
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:27,534
You can hear them
Very plainly from the coast

537
00:30:27,601 --> 00:30:29,033
When the wind's
This way.

538
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,868
I always tell my husband
That those guns

539
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:33,367
Make it feel like
Living right in the war.

540
00:30:33,434 --> 00:30:35,367
I always say-
Yes.

541
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,367
Thank you.
Good night.

542
00:30:37,434 --> 00:30:39,834
Good night.

543
00:30:42,601 --> 00:30:45,033
And if you want anything,
Just ring the bell.

544
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:48,701
Darling.

545
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:51,200
Those men coming down...

546
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:55,868
Thousands and thousands
And thousands of them.

547
00:30:56,968 --> 00:30:58,801
And in a little while,

548
00:30:58,868 --> 00:31:00,834
You'll be one of them!

549
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,534
You'll be gone with the
Rest of them! You'll-

550
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:06,834
Kitty, they're going
And I'm going.

551
00:31:06,901 --> 00:31:08,901
There's nothing
To be done about that.

552
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,834
Listen, darling,
There isn't much time left,

553
00:31:12,901 --> 00:31:14,501
And we must
Face the truth.

554
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:17,501
And the truth is that
In the short space of tonight,

555
00:31:17,567 --> 00:31:20,234
We must live
A whole life together.

556
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,834
We must pretend there's nothing
Tense and desperate about tonight.

557
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:26,601
We must pretend that
It's one of many nights.

558
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:28,868
So few hours.

559
00:31:28,934 --> 00:31:32,534
So little time together.

560
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:36,033
The only time I'll have to leave
You for the rest of our lives

561
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,367
Is to buy us both
A loaf of bread,

562
00:31:38,434 --> 00:31:39,734
A bottle of milk.

563
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:44,367
We're married.
See, darling?

564
00:31:44,434 --> 00:31:46,834
We've been married
For a long time.

565
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:49,367
This is the weekend,
And we've come to visit.

566
00:31:49,434 --> 00:31:52,868
We've come to visit
Your darling aunt josephine,

567
00:31:52,934 --> 00:31:55,400
And you're crying because
You didn't want to come.

568
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,934
Does it have to be
Aunt josephine?

569
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,701
Yes. It has to be
Aunt josephine.

570
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:11,300
Are you hungry?
I am.

571
00:32:12,968 --> 00:32:16,167
Shall I go and buy us that loaf
Of bread and bottle of milk now?

572
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,701
Make it meat and wine.

573
00:32:19,734 --> 00:32:20,701
Right.

574
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,868
Chicken, wine, cake,
A little cheese.

575
00:32:37,934 --> 00:32:39,534
With pleasure, sir.

576
00:32:39,601 --> 00:32:41,367
Do me a favor?
Of course.

577
00:32:41,434 --> 00:32:43,200
Would you let me
Have those flowers?

578
00:32:43,267 --> 00:32:45,200
Certainly, sir.
A little celebration, sir?

579
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:46,701
Something of the sort.

580
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:48,067
I'll be in the hall.

581
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,033
Thanks very much.

582
00:33:01,868 --> 00:33:04,000
Good heavens, Alan,
What are you doing here?

583
00:33:05,868 --> 00:33:08,501
Hello, Lawrence.
You on the job?

584
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:11,834
Soldiers must eat. An army
Moves on its belly, you know.

585
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:16,334
Ah, that's the spirit.
Wine, chicken... Flowers.

586
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,334
Well, I suppose
You're not alone.

587
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,167
You can suppose
What you please.

588
00:33:20,234 --> 00:33:21,834
Then I shall probably
Think the worst.

589
00:33:21,901 --> 00:33:23,501
Excuse me.
In a hurry, eh?

590
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:25,000
One can hardly blame you.

591
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:27,033
Move out of the way.

592
00:33:49,267 --> 00:33:50,734
Here we are.

593
00:33:52,934 --> 00:33:54,868
Darling, what a spread.

594
00:33:54,934 --> 00:33:56,200
Our wedding feast.

595
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:57,701
And the flowers.

596
00:33:57,767 --> 00:33:59,868
Where did you get them?

597
00:33:59,934 --> 00:34:01,467
They were just growing.

598
00:34:01,534 --> 00:34:02,968
I picked them for you.

599
00:34:03,033 --> 00:34:04,734
Here's bread.

600
00:34:05,868 --> 00:34:08,133
And, uh, salad.

601
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,300
Ah, yes, and cheese.

602
00:34:10,367 --> 00:34:11,801
This should be good,
Darling.

603
00:34:11,868 --> 00:34:13,334
Straight from
The mousetrap.

604
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,767
Idiot.

605
00:34:15,901 --> 00:34:17,334
Aren't they lovely?

606
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,000
I hope Mrs. Blow-porridge
Doesn't mind this.

607
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:25,667
*rolling, rolling *

608
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:28,834
* across the fields
That you won't see again *

609
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:32,334
* when the sergeant
Gives his orders *

610
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,000
* if you don't come back *

611
00:34:36,067 --> 00:34:39,167
* if you don't come back,
If you don't come back *

612
00:34:39,234 --> 00:34:41,834
I hope you like
Sauterne, my dear.

613
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,868
Will you serve the chicken?

614
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,868
Agatha, bertram,

615
00:34:58,934 --> 00:35:01,100
Mimi, harold.

616
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:04,801
This is the 25th wedding
Anniversary of your parents.

617
00:35:04,868 --> 00:35:06,133
15th.

618
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,634
Please, my dear.

619
00:35:09,701 --> 00:35:12,133
Twenty-five
Years ago today,

620
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,434
Your mother
Married your father.

621
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:17,000
Your mother...

622
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,534
Your mother
Was a lovely sight.

623
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,133
The most beautiful girl
I ever saw.

624
00:35:34,901 --> 00:35:36,801
And your father,
Children...

625
00:35:39,234 --> 00:35:40,167
Your father...

626
00:35:40,234 --> 00:35:41,501
Mimi!

627
00:35:41,567 --> 00:35:43,501
Kitty, can't you do
Anything with mimi?

628
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:45,133
She just bit
Little harold.

629
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,334
Do behave, mimi.
Now come to order, children.

630
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:54,067
As I was saying,
Your father...

631
00:35:56,234 --> 00:36:01,300
Was the finest,
Dearest, kindest...

632
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,300
Your father
Loved your mother

633
00:36:03,367 --> 00:36:06,667
As no one
Has ever loved before.

634
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:28,501
Oh, Alan.

635
00:36:57,567 --> 00:36:59,234
Don't hear it,
Darling.

636
00:37:00,434 --> 00:37:02,100
It'll stop in a minute.

637
00:37:07,534 --> 00:37:09,767
I've got to go now,
Kitty.

638
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:14,501
Will you do something
For me?

639
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:17,801
Whatever you wish, Alan.

640
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:20,767
Then sit here
Just where you are...

641
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:23,467
Close your eyes, darling,

642
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:25,501
And don't open them
Until I've gone.

643
00:37:29,367 --> 00:37:30,667
I love you.

644
00:37:32,033 --> 00:37:34,300
I'll always love you.

645
00:38:28,868 --> 00:38:30,501
Goodbye, my love.

646
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,801
Goodbye.

647
00:38:33,868 --> 00:38:34,834
Sergeant.

648
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,534
Detail, hut!

649
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:54,834
If you'd do that for me,
I'd feel awfully obliged.

650
00:38:54,901 --> 00:38:56,334
I'll do that for you.
Cheerio.

651
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,167
Thanks so much.
Cheerio.

652
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:01,834
Alan!

653
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:09,033
Hello, Alan.
Hello, Gerald.

654
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,100
It's only
Six more minutes.

655
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:16,467
We're the third transport going out.
Must be something really big this time.

656
00:39:16,534 --> 00:39:19,133
Well, did you say goodbye
To Kitty for me?

657
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,300
Yes.

658
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:23,300
I didn't come back. I knew you
Two wanted to be alone together.

659
00:39:23,367 --> 00:39:25,133
Oh, she knows that,
Gerald.

660
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,334
Lawrence. Come on, come on,
Got to hurry now.

661
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,968
Orders are that every man's got to
Have something hot before he leaves.

662
00:39:30,033 --> 00:39:32,634
We'll be getting
Something hot after we leave.

663
00:39:32,701 --> 00:39:35,801
Do you know Lawrence has been
Running about like that for two hours?

664
00:39:35,868 --> 00:39:37,968
He's offered me
Five cups of coffee.

665
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:40,467
Did Kitty...

666
00:39:40,534 --> 00:39:42,300
You know,
Did she mind you...

667
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:44,133
Was she all right
About you going?

668
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,234
Yes, she-

669
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,501
Coffee. Coffee here.
Coffee, Gerald?

670
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:49,734
Oh, hello, Alan.

671
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:52,334
All right. I don't suppose
It'll actually poison me.

672
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,501
Coffee, Alan?

673
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:55,334
I didn't think
You'd need any.

674
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,667
Like a whiskey?

675
00:39:56,734 --> 00:39:58,667
No, thanks.

676
00:39:58,734 --> 00:40:00,901
Wouldn't it be awful to be as
Bright as that at this hour?

677
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:03,501
I don't know about being bright,
But I can't help noticing things.

678
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,434
Oh, shut up,
Lawrence.

679
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:09,000
You two had better start getting on
Better. You're going to be cousins.

680
00:40:09,067 --> 00:40:12,501
Yes, indeed. You and Kitty.
I'd forgotten about that.

681
00:40:12,567 --> 00:40:16,000
And last night, what was that
- a farewell to bachelorhood?

682
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:18,400
A bit thick, you know.

683
00:40:18,467 --> 00:40:21,868
You know, there are times when I think
You're not quite right in the head.

684
00:40:21,934 --> 00:40:24,534
I'm sane enough to see
Straight, old fellow.

685
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:27,767
Ask him about the little
Girl of last night.

686
00:40:27,834 --> 00:40:29,100
Let's go.

687
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:31,033
Ask him about the supper
He was taking up to her.

688
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,334
Champagne and roses!

689
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:37,367
Alan, you can tell me
Her name.

690
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:39,968
I'll go back
And give her your love.

691
00:40:40,033 --> 00:40:42,367
Ha ha! Don't worry,
I won't poach.

692
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:43,801
I haven't the time!

693
00:40:43,868 --> 00:40:47,100
Ha ha ha! Come on, now.
Coffee's ready, boys.

694
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:49,467
Come on, there's
No time to lose, now.

695
00:41:22,901 --> 00:41:24,834
I see we have
A convoy with us.

696
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:26,701
Taking darn good care-

697
00:41:26,767 --> 00:41:29,033
What the devil was
That ass talking about?

698
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,534
I don't know.

699
00:41:30,601 --> 00:41:33,000
What does Lawrence
Ever talk about?

700
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:36,534
He seemed to bother you
A good deal.

701
00:41:36,601 --> 00:41:38,701
I'd like to forget
About Lawrence.

702
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:40,067
Do you mind?

703
00:41:45,934 --> 00:41:47,868
Alan, I've got to
Ask you a question.

704
00:41:49,267 --> 00:41:50,534
Yes?

705
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:53,033
Was there any truth
In what Lawrence was saying?

706
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,534
Yes, quite a lot.
Now, will that do?

707
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:59,200
No, it won't.
I've a right to know more.

708
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:00,567
Since when?

709
00:42:00,634 --> 00:42:02,501
Since yesterday.

710
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:05,167
Perhaps you've forgotten
What happened yesterday.

711
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:06,868
Perhaps I have forgotten.

712
00:42:08,434 --> 00:42:11,501
I can't believe you were down
There last night with a girl.

713
00:42:11,567 --> 00:42:15,701
Alan, you couldn't have left
Kitty and come down there and...

714
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,167
Were you drunk?

715
00:42:19,234 --> 00:42:20,467
Were you?!

716
00:42:20,534 --> 00:42:22,501
No, I wasn't drunk.
I was dead sober.

717
00:42:22,567 --> 00:42:24,133
A girl was there.

718
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,300
Think what the devil you like.
Think anything you like, anything.

719
00:43:10,734 --> 00:43:12,501
Do you mind
Signing this for me?

720
00:43:12,567 --> 00:43:13,801
What is it?

721
00:43:15,567 --> 00:43:17,501
This is an application
For special leave.

722
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:19,501
I thought I'd like a bit.

723
00:43:19,567 --> 00:43:21,601
You sign it, I'll take it
Up to the colonel.

724
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:24,367
What do you want leave for?

725
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:26,501
Last time, I was recalled.

726
00:43:26,567 --> 00:43:28,501
The job that
Brought us back is over.

727
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:30,734
Things are pretty quiet.
I'd like to go home again.

728
00:43:30,801 --> 00:43:33,934
I don't think
That's a good enough reason.

729
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,267
At any rate, we can see what the colonel
Says. You've no objection, have you?

730
00:43:37,334 --> 00:43:38,767
I'm not going to sign it.

731
00:43:38,834 --> 00:43:41,200
Look here, Gerald, we can't
Go on like this any longer.

732
00:43:41,267 --> 00:43:43,534
I want to go home
To marry Kitty.

733
00:43:43,601 --> 00:43:45,834
Surely you can
Understand that.

734
00:43:45,901 --> 00:43:48,367
I could have before that night in
Folkestone. I certainly can't now.

735
00:43:48,434 --> 00:43:49,868
You mean you'll
Keep me here?

736
00:43:49,934 --> 00:43:53,267
That's just what I do mean.
You infernal fool!

737
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:58,501
Evening, shannon.
Evening, trent.

738
00:43:58,567 --> 00:44:00,033
Evening, sir.
Sit down, sir.

739
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,734
We have reports of enemy
Activity in the northern sector.

740
00:44:02,801 --> 00:44:04,801
We've got to find out
What it's all about.

741
00:44:04,868 --> 00:44:07,634
Tonight's a good night.
There's no moon.

742
00:44:07,701 --> 00:44:09,801
A raid, sir?
Yes. I want a dozen men.

743
00:44:09,868 --> 00:44:11,801
Can you take out
A party?

744
00:44:11,868 --> 00:44:14,000
I think I can find
Six or eight, sir.

745
00:44:14,067 --> 00:44:15,501
We're rather depleted.

746
00:44:15,567 --> 00:44:17,968
I know, I know.
What about trent here?

747
00:44:20,067 --> 00:44:22,000
He's just asked
For immediate leave, sir.

748
00:44:22,067 --> 00:44:26,167
I'll only be taking
Volunteers, men who want to go.

749
00:44:26,234 --> 00:44:28,634
I'll go. Glad to, sir.

750
00:44:29,734 --> 00:44:31,334
Here is the sector.

751
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,834
I should warn you,
They may be expecting you.

752
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:36,167
Now, I would suggest...

753
00:44:36,234 --> 00:44:38,167
Will there be
Anything else, sir?

754
00:44:38,234 --> 00:44:40,167
No, that's all.
Good luck, sir.

755
00:44:40,234 --> 00:44:41,701
Thank you, spig.

756
00:44:43,734 --> 00:44:45,000
Good luck, Mr. Trent.

757
00:44:45,067 --> 00:44:46,801
Thank you, spig.

758
00:45:14,868 --> 00:45:16,801
Four minutes to go.
You have your orders.

759
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:40,167
Alan.

760
00:47:40,234 --> 00:47:41,534
My god.

761
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:43,534
Alan.

762
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,801
Kitty, he's here.

763
00:48:16,601 --> 00:48:17,801
Gerald.

764
00:48:17,868 --> 00:48:19,334
Mother.

765
00:48:21,033 --> 00:48:22,467
Oh, darling.

766
00:48:22,534 --> 00:48:25,467
Darling, it's so good
To have you home.

767
00:48:25,534 --> 00:48:27,501
I thought they'd never
Let you come.

768
00:48:28,868 --> 00:48:29,934
You're thinner.

769
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,501
Am I? Well,
I'm feeling pretty well.

770
00:48:34,367 --> 00:48:35,834
How are you, martin?

771
00:48:35,901 --> 00:48:37,300
Very well, thank you, Mr. Gerald.

772
00:48:37,367 --> 00:48:38,801
Glad to
Have you back.

773
00:48:38,868 --> 00:48:41,167
Glad to be back.
Country's looking beautiful.

774
00:48:41,234 --> 00:48:43,167
It's been a perfect
Summer, sir.

775
00:48:43,234 --> 00:48:45,501
Just take them up to Mr.
Gerald's room, martin.

776
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,501
I'll unpack them myself.
Very good, ma'am.

777
00:48:47,567 --> 00:48:50,567
Martin, Miss Kitty
Won't be staying for dinner.

778
00:48:50,634 --> 00:48:52,334
Kitty?
She's here.

779
00:48:56,067 --> 00:48:58,367
I'll spare you
For a few moments.

780
00:49:30,868 --> 00:49:32,567
Hello, Gerald.

781
00:49:32,634 --> 00:49:33,601
Kitty.

782
00:49:40,033 --> 00:49:41,801
How wonderful to
See you again, Gerald.

783
00:49:41,868 --> 00:49:43,968
What a time they kept you
In hospital.

784
00:49:44,033 --> 00:49:45,100
Two months.

785
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:47,167
I hope they patched you up
Pretty well.

786
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,033
Oh, yes,
I'm as good as new.

787
00:49:50,567 --> 00:49:52,667
Where-
Where's old Peter?

788
00:49:52,734 --> 00:49:54,501
He's gone, Gerald.

789
00:49:54,567 --> 00:49:55,667
Oh, no.

790
00:49:55,734 --> 00:49:57,667
He was such
A very old dog.

791
00:49:57,734 --> 00:49:59,501
Your mother found him
One morning

792
00:49:59,567 --> 00:50:02,167
Curled up in his basket
As though he was asleep.

793
00:50:02,234 --> 00:50:03,667
Poor old Peter.

794
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,701
Doesn't seem the same
Without him.

795
00:50:07,234 --> 00:50:08,200
No.

796
00:50:09,901 --> 00:50:11,534
Kitty.

797
00:50:11,601 --> 00:50:13,667
Oh, Gerald.

798
00:50:13,734 --> 00:50:15,701
Kitty, Kitty.

799
00:50:17,234 --> 00:50:18,200
Dear.

800
00:50:24,601 --> 00:50:26,534
Gerald, I'm so sorry.

801
00:50:26,601 --> 00:50:28,868
What a bad homecoming
For you.

802
00:50:28,934 --> 00:50:30,868
And I wanted it
To be different,

803
00:50:30,934 --> 00:50:32,868
So much happier for you.

804
00:50:32,934 --> 00:50:36,133
No. It couldn't have been.

805
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:41,200
Gerald, it was
The night of the 17th,

806
00:50:41,267 --> 00:50:42,534
Wasn't it?

807
00:50:42,601 --> 00:50:43,567
Yes.

808
00:50:44,601 --> 00:50:47,534
What-what time was it?

809
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:49,033
I don't know, dear.

810
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:52,868
There-
There was an explosion.

811
00:50:52,934 --> 00:50:54,901
We never saw him again.

812
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:58,400
I think it was
Shortly after...

813
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:00,367
Shortly after 8:00.

814
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,367
I knew.

815
00:51:04,067 --> 00:51:05,667
I'd been so happy.

816
00:51:05,734 --> 00:51:09,367
He'd wired me that he
Expected to get leave.

817
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,701
And then...

818
00:51:12,901 --> 00:51:14,501
He wanted to get leave.

819
00:51:14,567 --> 00:51:16,634
He wanted to come home to you.

820
00:51:18,067 --> 00:51:20,067
And he couldn't get it?

821
00:51:22,567 --> 00:51:24,567
I wouldn't give it to him.

822
00:51:27,601 --> 00:51:28,601
What?

823
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:30,868
I could have
Given him leave.

824
00:51:30,934 --> 00:51:32,367
I refused.
It was intentional.

825
00:51:32,434 --> 00:51:34,701
What are you talking about?

826
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:36,701
What are you saying?

827
00:51:36,767 --> 00:51:38,367
Gerald!

828
00:51:38,434 --> 00:51:39,868
You were devoted to him.

829
00:51:39,934 --> 00:51:42,133
You would have done
Anything for him.

830
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,868
I'm telling you
What I did for him.

831
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,868
I killed him!
Can't you understand it?

832
00:51:45,934 --> 00:51:48,567
If I'd given him that leave,
He'd be alive today.

833
00:51:49,601 --> 00:51:51,133
I killed him.

834
00:51:52,767 --> 00:51:54,367
Why didn't you
Give it to him?

835
00:51:54,434 --> 00:51:56,367
Why didn't you want him
To come home?

836
00:51:56,434 --> 00:51:58,567
I can't tell you.
A misunderstanding.

837
00:51:59,934 --> 00:52:02,167
Tell me what it was.
I've got to know.

838
00:52:02,234 --> 00:52:05,000
It can make no difference now.
Let's leave it alone.

839
00:52:05,067 --> 00:52:07,000
I- I was mistaken.

840
00:52:07,067 --> 00:52:09,167
Stop it! Stop it!
What nonsense are you talking?

841
00:52:09,234 --> 00:52:12,133
What are you sparing me from?
What difference do I make now?

842
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,167
Tell me what it was, Gerald.

843
00:52:14,234 --> 00:52:16,501
I've got to know.

844
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:19,901
Can't you see?
I shall only torture myself.

845
00:52:19,968 --> 00:52:23,334
It was that night
Our leave was cancelled,

846
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,300
That night at folkestone.

847
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,100
I thought I...

848
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:29,801
I believed...

849
00:52:31,901 --> 00:52:34,667
You thought
He was not alone?

850
00:52:36,434 --> 00:52:37,701
Is that it?

851
00:52:37,767 --> 00:52:39,067
Oh, Kitty,
For heaven's sake.

852
00:52:40,934 --> 00:52:42,567
You were right.

853
00:52:44,767 --> 00:52:46,167
I was with him.

854
00:52:48,934 --> 00:52:50,167
Kitty.

855
00:52:53,267 --> 00:52:56,000
So it was that...

856
00:52:57,934 --> 00:53:01,334
That night that caused...

857
00:53:11,234 --> 00:53:13,000
You killed him,
You say?

858
00:53:13,067 --> 00:53:14,834
You killed him?

859
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:18,133
You mean we killed him.

860
00:53:20,234 --> 00:53:22,200
It was that night.

861
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,501
It was because
I loved him so.

862
00:53:27,567 --> 00:53:30,467
Because I loved him so,
He died.

863
00:53:32,901 --> 00:53:34,167
We killed him.

864
00:53:34,234 --> 00:53:37,834
In some crazy way,

865
00:53:37,901 --> 00:53:39,334
Between us,

866
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,334
We killed him.

867
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,133
Alan!

868
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,968
Oh, Alan!

869
00:54:08,701 --> 00:54:09,834
Alan!

870
00:54:18,067 --> 00:54:20,667
Every one of you men

871
00:54:20,734 --> 00:54:22,334
Who are gathered here

872
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,267
Has made
A great sacrifice...

873
00:54:25,334 --> 00:54:28,834
...the greatest sacrifice
A man can make

874
00:54:28,901 --> 00:54:30,834
In the service of his country

875
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:34,734
Unless it be life itself.

876
00:54:34,801 --> 00:54:36,167
I know, my friends,

877
00:54:36,234 --> 00:54:38,000
That for the things
Of the eye

878
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:41,334
You must now substitute
The things of the spirit.

879
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,501
But where before
You saw the green grass,

880
00:54:44,567 --> 00:54:48,033
The flowing brooks,
The hills in all their colors,

881
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,834
The leaves of the trees...

882
00:54:51,767 --> 00:54:54,534
What are those
Compared to the inner beauties

883
00:54:54,601 --> 00:54:56,834
That only you, my friends,

884
00:54:56,901 --> 00:55:00,567
Who have lost the sensual,
The minor sight,

885
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:02,767
Will be able to discover.

886
00:55:02,834 --> 00:55:07,234
Your country will be
There behind you.

887
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,801
Do you have to stand there
And tell us what we're missing?

888
00:55:09,868 --> 00:55:13,133
Curse the things
Of the spirit! Curse them!

889
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,133
It's the other things
We want to see,

890
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,133
And your fine words
Don't make it easier.

891
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,501
It's the green grass
And the flowing brooks

892
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,834
And the hills
In all their colors

893
00:55:22,901 --> 00:55:25,167
And the faces
Of those people we love-

894
00:55:25,234 --> 00:55:27,167
Those are the things
We want to see,

895
00:55:27,234 --> 00:55:29,501
And those are the things
We'll never see again!

896
00:55:29,567 --> 00:55:32,834
What do we care
How grateful you are?

897
00:55:32,901 --> 00:55:35,667
I want to see my girl again.

898
00:55:35,734 --> 00:55:38,367
That's all I want to see.
That's all I want to see!

899
00:55:38,434 --> 00:55:39,367
Shut up!

900
00:55:39,434 --> 00:55:40,634
Shut up, I tell you!

901
00:55:40,701 --> 00:55:43,133
We know what you feel.
We feel it too.

902
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,467
What good does this do?

903
00:55:44,534 --> 00:55:46,634
Shut up and sit down.

904
00:55:56,934 --> 00:56:00,234
I'm sorry.
It can't be helped sometimes.

905
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,968
Gentlemen, I think
We're all tired.

906
00:56:06,033 --> 00:56:09,801
I'll extend your regrets
To our guest, Mr. Tanner,

907
00:56:09,868 --> 00:56:12,000
And I'm sure he'll understand.

908
00:56:12,067 --> 00:56:14,300
Now, suppose we all
Go to bed,

909
00:56:14,367 --> 00:56:16,667
And I hope
You all rest well.

910
00:56:24,534 --> 00:56:26,300
Are the lights out yet?

911
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,167
How the devil
Do I know?

912
00:56:28,234 --> 00:56:30,501
What difference
Does it make, anyway?

913
00:56:30,567 --> 00:56:32,334
No, they're not out yet.

914
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,000
Can't you tell
When they go out?

915
00:56:34,067 --> 00:56:36,767
No, I can't. I guess
I'm not used to it yet.

916
00:56:37,901 --> 00:56:40,000
There go the lights now.

917
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:41,501
Can't you
Tell the difference?

918
00:56:41,567 --> 00:56:42,601
No.

919
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:44,167
Good night,
George.

920
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,667
Good night, archie.

921
00:56:53,734 --> 00:56:54,701
I say.

922
00:56:56,067 --> 00:56:57,033
Yes?

923
00:56:58,734 --> 00:57:01,634
Thanks for stopping me
Down there.

924
00:57:01,701 --> 00:57:03,934
Oh, that's all right.

925
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,467
Good night, Crane.

926
00:57:05,534 --> 00:57:07,100
Good night, austin.

927
00:57:14,033 --> 00:57:16,667
Y.

928
00:57:20,367 --> 00:57:22,601
Darling, good night.

929
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,634
I hope you're not
Too glad to leave us.

930
00:57:33,734 --> 00:57:35,667
No, I think
I'm rather sorry.

931
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:39,701
You want to join them
Out there, Crane?

932
00:57:39,767 --> 00:57:43,033
Oh, no, thank you.
I must be off soon.

933
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:46,467
We haven't been able to help
You very much, I'm afraid.

934
00:57:46,534 --> 00:57:49,200
That's true, sir. It's
Been my fault, not yours.

935
00:57:49,267 --> 00:57:51,901
Fighting something
With yourself, aren't you?

936
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,033
Yes, I suppose
You could call it that.

937
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,534
You don't want to
Talk about it?

938
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:00,267
No, sir George.

939
00:58:00,334 --> 00:58:01,868
All right, Crane.

940
00:58:01,934 --> 00:58:04,534
Now, there are a few routine
Things I must tell you.

941
00:58:04,601 --> 00:58:07,067
First of all, I'm
Assigning an orderly to you.

942
00:58:07,133 --> 00:58:09,067
He's a very pleasant fellow.
Worked for us before.

943
00:58:09,133 --> 00:58:11,067
He will stay with you
Until you're settled.

944
00:58:11,133 --> 00:58:13,734
I'd rather not.
Those are the rules.

945
00:58:13,801 --> 00:58:15,334
He'll take you
To your home...

946
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,200
But I'm not going home.

947
00:58:17,267 --> 00:58:20,167
I have no... Home.

948
00:58:20,234 --> 00:58:23,400
And your name
Is not roger Crane.

949
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,634
It's as good a name
As any other.

950
00:58:29,701 --> 00:58:31,501
Yes, I suppose so.

951
00:58:31,567 --> 00:58:33,501
In any event,
It's your own business.

952
00:58:33,567 --> 00:58:35,767
I've some things here
That belong to you.

953
00:58:36,901 --> 00:58:38,167
A few pounds,

954
00:58:38,234 --> 00:58:41,367
A very
Disreputable-looking pipe...

955
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:42,534
Thank you.

956
00:58:42,601 --> 00:58:44,200
...and a picture.

957
00:58:44,267 --> 00:58:45,701
Oh. May I...?

958
00:58:45,767 --> 00:58:48,133
No. I've kept
These things for a reason.

959
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,868
Now, look here, Crane.

960
00:58:49,934 --> 00:58:52,534
You came to us
From an enemy prison hospital.

961
00:58:52,601 --> 00:58:55,868
Your card read that all means of
Identification had been destroyed,

962
00:58:55,934 --> 00:58:58,200
But that you'd given
The name of roger Crane.

963
00:58:58,267 --> 00:59:01,701
Now, I could have pursued
The matter of identification,

964
00:59:01,767 --> 00:59:03,033
But I didn't.

965
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,367
I knew that.
I was grateful. May I-

966
00:59:05,434 --> 00:59:08,033
I knew that you were trying
To put the past behind you,

967
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:11,868
But today-
Today the past has come back,

968
00:59:11,934 --> 00:59:13,200
And must be faced.

969
00:59:13,267 --> 00:59:14,334
The picture.

970
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,167
This picture's
Of three people,

971
00:59:17,234 --> 00:59:20,000
And I see there's
An inscription on the back.

972
00:59:20,067 --> 00:59:23,434
"take care of each other.
Kitty."

973
00:59:24,567 --> 00:59:28,000
Those people are not
Strangers to one another.

974
00:59:28,067 --> 00:59:29,834
Why aren't you going home?

975
00:59:32,234 --> 00:59:34,167
Fear of being pitied,
I suppose.

976
00:59:34,234 --> 00:59:36,167
Fear of being a nuisance.

977
00:59:36,234 --> 00:59:38,501
That's been your fight?

978
00:59:38,567 --> 00:59:39,601
Yes.

979
00:59:39,667 --> 00:59:41,334
All right, Crane,

980
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,000
Then fight your fight through
And go home.

981
00:59:44,067 --> 00:59:46,334
Now, look here. I want
You to do something for me.

982
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,200
I want you to prove to me
That I'm not a failure

983
00:59:49,267 --> 00:59:51,367
By going back to your people
And your friends

984
00:59:51,434 --> 00:59:53,534
And living among them
Like an ordinary man.

985
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:56,334
You need owe nothing
To anyone but yourself.

986
00:59:57,767 --> 01:00:00,701
But you do need
Love and companionship.

987
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:02,901
You can't live without them,
You know.

988
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:05,400
Now, go home.

989
01:00:08,767 --> 01:00:10,033
You think I should?

990
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,033
You think it's right?

991
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,601
Yes, Crane, yes...

992
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:18,634
I do.

993
01:00:18,701 --> 01:00:20,133
I've wanted to,

994
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,968
Every day, every hour.

995
01:00:24,567 --> 01:00:26,167
The sun's out, isn't it?

996
01:00:26,234 --> 01:00:27,434
Yes.

997
01:00:27,501 --> 01:00:29,334
And before it goes down,
You can be home.

998
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,834
Before it goes down,
I can be home.

999
01:00:32,901 --> 01:00:34,834
It's true.

1000
01:00:34,901 --> 01:00:36,334
Think of it.

1001
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,834
Before it goes down,
I'll be-

1002
01:00:39,901 --> 01:00:41,634
I'll be home!

1003
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,968
Now we're coming
Into medford.

1004
01:00:51,033 --> 01:00:53,000
I used to come here for
The fair when I was a boy.

1005
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:54,534
Pretty country,
Isn't it?

1006
01:00:54,601 --> 01:00:56,067
What time do you make it?

1007
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,534
12:20, sir.

1008
01:00:58,601 --> 01:00:59,868
Getting very near.

1009
01:00:59,934 --> 01:01:03,367
I make it 12:23.
You must be a little slow.

1010
01:01:03,434 --> 01:01:05,367
Another 22 minutes.

1011
01:01:05,434 --> 01:01:07,367
The last minutes
Are always the longest.

1012
01:01:07,434 --> 01:01:11,367
Yes. Do you mind if I step out in
The corridor and have a bite, sir?

1013
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:14,300
No, you go. I suppose
I've about talked your head off.

1014
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:16,234
Oh, that's all right, sir.

1015
01:01:18,334 --> 01:01:19,968
Care to see the paper?

1016
01:01:20,033 --> 01:01:23,634
Thanks very much.
Thank you.

1017
01:01:23,701 --> 01:01:28,667
Why, I'm sorry. I
- I didn't know. I hadn't any idea.

1018
01:01:28,734 --> 01:01:30,667
That's all right.
It was very kind of you.

1019
01:01:30,734 --> 01:01:32,667
I was just showing off.

1020
01:01:32,734 --> 01:01:34,801
Sir George would have
Liked that, wouldn't he?

1021
01:01:34,868 --> 01:01:38,334
Well, I think I'll
Join you in a smoke,

1022
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,000
Stretch my legs.

1023
01:01:40,067 --> 01:01:41,033
Excuse me.

1024
01:01:44,968 --> 01:01:46,834
Is it far
To your home, sir?

1025
01:01:46,901 --> 01:01:48,767
Not very far.

1026
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:51,334
There used to be a very
Dilapidated cab outside the station.

1027
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,801
Haven't you told them
You're coming, sir?

1028
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,367
No.

1029
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:06,667
You see, I only made up
My mind at the last minute.

1030
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:10,868
You won't mind
My mentioning it, sir,

1031
01:02:10,934 --> 01:02:14,234
But, uh,
They know that you...

1032
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:18,667
No.

1033
01:02:19,901 --> 01:02:22,167
Be pretty much
Of a shock, won't it, sir?

1034
01:03:12,267 --> 01:03:13,868
I'm here, darling.

1035
01:03:13,934 --> 01:03:17,167
Can't you-
Can't you see me?

1036
01:03:18,701 --> 01:03:20,467
I can't see anything else,

1037
01:03:20,534 --> 01:03:22,801
But I can see you.

1038
01:03:22,868 --> 01:03:25,133
I've seen you every minute,

1039
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,100
This whole long time.

1040
01:03:28,133 --> 01:03:30,801
Your face is turned up
To me,

1041
01:03:30,868 --> 01:03:35,167
And that long, slow smile makes
You look like a little girl again.

1042
01:03:36,701 --> 01:03:39,434
Kitty, you are
Smiling, aren't you?

1043
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:43,968
Yes. Yes, darling.

1044
01:03:45,567 --> 01:03:47,501
Come down now, Alan.

1045
01:03:47,567 --> 01:03:50,167
Take my hand.

1046
01:03:50,234 --> 01:03:51,534
I'll help you.

1047
01:03:51,601 --> 01:03:54,000
Blind!

1048
01:03:54,067 --> 01:03:56,501
Coming home,
I guess.

1049
01:03:56,567 --> 01:03:58,167
Sad.

1050
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:02,167
That poor girl,
Married to him,

1051
01:04:02,234 --> 01:04:04,501
Day in, day out,

1052
01:04:04,567 --> 01:04:10,133
Helping him...

1053
01:04:11,434 --> 01:04:13,501
Take my hand,
Darling.

1054
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,968
I'll help you.

1055
01:04:16,033 --> 01:04:17,968
I'll help you.
Help me?

1056
01:04:18,033 --> 01:04:20,968
Help me.

1057
01:04:21,033 --> 01:04:25,501
Help me!

1058
01:04:28,033 --> 01:04:29,968
They're
Pulling in, sir.

1059
01:04:41,534 --> 01:04:44,300
This is it, sir.
Camden junction.

1060
01:04:44,367 --> 01:04:46,634
We're not getting off.

1061
01:04:46,701 --> 01:04:47,968
Sir.

1062
01:04:48,067 --> 01:04:50,667
Why, what's the matter, sir?

1063
01:04:50,734 --> 01:04:52,501
You said
This was your station.

1064
01:04:52,567 --> 01:04:54,200
We're not getting off.

1065
01:05:12,067 --> 01:05:14,100
That was
The London train.

1066
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:16,434
Yes, of course.

1067
01:05:16,501 --> 01:05:18,400
It passes every day
At this time.

1068
01:05:19,501 --> 01:05:20,901
Yes, I know.

1069
01:05:22,601 --> 01:05:25,000
But today I just happened
To think of it coming in.

1070
01:05:26,534 --> 01:05:28,501
I don't know why.

1071
01:05:56,734 --> 01:05:58,834
Betty. Betty!

1072
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:00,334
Come here at once.

1073
01:06:10,901 --> 01:06:12,834
I've unpacked
Your things, sir.

1074
01:06:12,901 --> 01:06:14,767
The bell's
Near the end of the bed

1075
01:06:14,834 --> 01:06:16,601
If you should
Want anything, sir.

1076
01:06:16,667 --> 01:06:18,434
There's an oil lamp
Beside the bed.

1077
01:06:18,501 --> 01:06:19,767
You be careful.

1078
01:06:19,834 --> 01:06:22,267
Is there anything else
I can do for you, sir?

1079
01:06:22,334 --> 01:06:23,334
No, thank you.

1080
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,400
Good night, sir.

1081
01:06:24,467 --> 01:06:26,434
Get a good night's rest.

1082
01:06:26,501 --> 01:06:27,801
Good night, mills.

1083
01:06:31,868 --> 01:06:34,334
I'll turn the gas off here
Before I go, sir.

1084
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,334
Are you sure I-

1085
01:07:24,734 --> 01:07:26,300
May I come in?

1086
01:07:31,734 --> 01:07:33,334
It's me, betty.

1087
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,067
I brought the water.

1088
01:07:46,934 --> 01:07:50,033
Why do you stand there
Like that?

1089
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:53,100
You look so funny.

1090
01:07:53,167 --> 01:07:55,067
Go on, ask him.

1091
01:07:55,133 --> 01:07:57,400
It's my brothers.
Do you mind?

1092
01:07:57,467 --> 01:08:00,968
They wanted to look at you.
They've never seen a blind man.

1093
01:08:02,434 --> 01:08:05,234
Are you cross with us?

1094
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:07,200
No, no.

1095
01:08:07,267 --> 01:08:08,734
Look at me,
By all means.

1096
01:08:08,801 --> 01:08:09,734
Look.

1097
01:08:17,901 --> 01:08:20,834
Why, now,
What's all this?

1098
01:08:20,901 --> 01:08:22,868
Come, come.
This won't do.

1099
01:08:22,934 --> 01:08:24,834
Don't cry, please.

1100
01:08:24,901 --> 01:08:27,300
Here, here.
Take my handkerchief.

1101
01:08:28,501 --> 01:08:29,467
There.

1102
01:08:30,501 --> 01:08:31,834
There. That's it.

1103
01:08:31,901 --> 01:08:33,667
That's better.

1104
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:36,934
It's-
It's Miss Gallop, isn't it?

1105
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Yes.

1106
01:08:38,067 --> 01:08:40,334
And these
Are my brothers.

1107
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,367
Well, it was kind of you
To come and see me.

1108
01:08:43,434 --> 01:08:44,701
Shall we sit down?

1109
01:08:44,767 --> 01:08:46,834
There's a big chair
Somewhere around.

1110
01:08:49,934 --> 01:08:51,868
Here it is.
Thank you.

1111
01:08:51,934 --> 01:08:53,234
Here.

1112
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:57,701
I thought you were angry.
You weren't. Were you?

1113
01:08:57,767 --> 01:08:58,767
No, no.

1114
01:08:58,834 --> 01:09:00,534
Here's
Your handkerchief.

1115
01:09:00,601 --> 01:09:03,000
Thank you. Could you
Introduce me to your brothers?

1116
01:09:03,067 --> 01:09:04,701
This is joe
And this is ginger.

1117
01:09:04,767 --> 01:09:06,367
Hello there.
Hello!

1118
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:07,734
And I'm betty.

1119
01:09:07,801 --> 01:09:10,067
You called me
Miss Gallop.

1120
01:09:10,133 --> 01:09:12,367
Let me have
A look at you, betty.

1121
01:09:12,434 --> 01:09:13,734
How can you?

1122
01:09:18,567 --> 01:09:21,801
Oh, this is
A nice little face.

1123
01:09:23,567 --> 01:09:25,667
Nice perky little face.

1124
01:09:25,734 --> 01:09:28,334
Now I know
Just what you're like.

1125
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,334
Like to have
A look at me?

1126
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,200
Is this ginger?
Yes.

1127
01:09:35,734 --> 01:09:37,601
Oh, he's all right.

1128
01:09:41,734 --> 01:09:43,834
Your nose turns up
A little bit, doesn't it?

1129
01:09:43,901 --> 01:09:45,167
Yes!

1130
01:09:45,234 --> 01:09:46,501
Now do joe.

1131
01:09:46,567 --> 01:09:49,367
No, I don't want to
Be looked at. Let's go.

1132
01:09:49,434 --> 01:09:51,033
We'll see you
In the morning.

1133
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,033
That's right.

1134
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,701
We're going
On a picnic.

1135
01:09:53,767 --> 01:09:55,367
Do you
Want to come with us?

1136
01:09:55,434 --> 01:09:57,367
We're going fishing.
You are?

1137
01:09:57,434 --> 01:09:59,200
Well,
Good night.

1138
01:09:59,267 --> 01:10:00,200
Good night,
Betty.

1139
01:10:00,267 --> 01:10:02,801
Good night.

1140
01:10:25,801 --> 01:10:27,501
Children!

1141
01:10:27,567 --> 01:10:29,501
This is the last time
I'm going to tell you.

1142
01:10:29,567 --> 01:10:32,834
Take off your caps and make up
Your minds to stay in the house.

1143
01:10:32,901 --> 01:10:34,534
It's going to rain
All day.

1144
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:52,834
I'm sorry. Mother says we
Can't go to the river today.

1145
01:10:52,901 --> 01:10:53,901
What?

1146
01:10:53,968 --> 01:10:56,534
Oh, I'm afraid
I'd forgotten.

1147
01:10:56,601 --> 01:10:58,701
But we'll surely
Take you tomorrow.

1148
01:10:58,767 --> 01:11:00,033
All right.

1149
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,701
What are you
Going to do today?

1150
01:11:02,767 --> 01:11:04,701
I don't know.

1151
01:11:04,767 --> 01:11:07,534
I thought grownup people always
Had something to do every day.

1152
01:11:07,601 --> 01:11:08,868
I thought so too.

1153
01:11:08,934 --> 01:11:10,701
Now I find
It isn't always true.

1154
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:14,634
When I grow up, I'm
Going to be a white whale

1155
01:11:14,701 --> 01:11:16,300
And live in the river.

1156
01:11:16,367 --> 01:11:17,801
Don't listen to him.

1157
01:11:17,868 --> 01:11:20,367
The other day,
He wanted to be a horse.

1158
01:11:20,434 --> 01:11:24,300
Ha ha ha! Well, ginger doesn't seem
To like the human form, at any rate.

1159
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:26,968
I'm going to be
A dressmaker

1160
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:29,033
Or a singer
When I grow up.

1161
01:11:31,734 --> 01:11:33,467
Would you like me to sing?

1162
01:11:33,534 --> 01:11:35,767
Oh, no, no.

1163
01:11:35,834 --> 01:11:39,300
What did you want to be
When you were young?

1164
01:11:39,367 --> 01:11:40,667
A writer.

1165
01:11:40,734 --> 01:11:42,334
Then why didn't you?

1166
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,100
I don't know.

1167
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:47,667
I suppose for the same reason
Ginger won't be a white whale.

1168
01:11:47,734 --> 01:11:49,634
A writer?
That's nice.

1169
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:54,334
I've got a pencil. Would you
Like to write something now?

1170
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,834
No, no, indeed.

1171
01:11:55,901 --> 01:11:58,167
That was
A long time ago, betty.

1172
01:11:58,234 --> 01:11:59,567
Oh.

1173
01:11:59,634 --> 01:12:02,968
Maybe down by the river
You will write us something.

1174
01:12:03,033 --> 01:12:04,534
I told you this morning,

1175
01:12:04,601 --> 01:12:06,868
He can't even see the river.

1176
01:12:06,934 --> 01:12:09,501
You can't see anything,
Can you?

1177
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:15,701
You're very snobbish
About your eyes, joe.

1178
01:12:15,767 --> 01:12:18,133
Maybe I'll be able to see
Some things about the river

1179
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,634
That you can't see.

1180
01:12:19,701 --> 01:12:21,634
Like what?

1181
01:12:21,701 --> 01:12:23,968
You see?

1182
01:12:24,033 --> 01:12:26,300
Well, you can see
That it's a river,

1183
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:28,467
Just a pretty
Country river,

1184
01:12:28,534 --> 01:12:32,801
But I can see
That it's big and wide,

1185
01:12:32,868 --> 01:12:34,634
And that its banks
Are tangled

1186
01:12:34,701 --> 01:12:37,000
With a strange kind
Of undergrowth,

1187
01:12:37,067 --> 01:12:39,334
A kind
You've never even seen.

1188
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,000
And there are sounds

1189
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:43,000
That you've
Never heard before.

1190
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:47,167
Bright-colored wild birds
Are flying about.

1191
01:12:47,234 --> 01:12:49,667
Monkeys are jabbering
In the trees,

1192
01:12:49,734 --> 01:12:53,400
And there are large
Green crocodiles in the river.

1193
01:12:53,467 --> 01:12:55,167
You hear the crocodiles,

1194
01:12:55,234 --> 01:12:57,667
And you don't like
The sound they make

1195
01:12:57,734 --> 01:13:00,334
Because you've got to swim
Through them to rescue betty,

1196
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,501
Who's been taken captive
By a cannibal.

1197
01:13:02,567 --> 01:13:03,701
Who, me?

1198
01:13:03,767 --> 01:13:05,033
You.

1199
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:06,501
And dimly
Through the jungle,

1200
01:13:06,567 --> 01:13:10,534
Joe and ginger
Can hear your cries

1201
01:13:10,601 --> 01:13:13,367
Above the strange song
Of the birds

1202
01:13:13,434 --> 01:13:17,300
And above the shrill chatter
Of the monkeys.

1203
01:13:17,367 --> 01:13:21,133
Suddenly,
You and ginger

1204
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,968
Jump into the river...

1205
01:13:23,033 --> 01:13:25,801
"jack and Peter
Were with her on the trip,

1206
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:28,634
"and nothing else mattered
To Jennifer,

1207
01:13:28,701 --> 01:13:31,968
"for the boys,
Tired of fishing,

1208
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:34,767
"were splashing about
In the sea,

1209
01:13:34,834 --> 01:13:39,801
"having left Jennifer on board
To watch the lines.

1210
01:13:39,868 --> 01:13:42,033
In their haste... "

1211
01:13:45,133 --> 01:13:48,334
"they had swum a little distance
Away from the side

1212
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,501
When a puff of wind
Stirred the sails."

1213
01:13:51,567 --> 01:13:54,434
I smell plum cake,
Or am I mistaken?

1214
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:02,334
Do you think we ought to
Eat the cake now?

1215
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,868
I mean while I'm here,

1216
01:14:03,934 --> 01:14:06,434
So that I'd know
Whether it was right or not.

1217
01:14:06,501 --> 01:14:09,234
No. We must wait until
Hannah brings in the tea.

1218
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,334
I wouldn't ask
For a piece of cake.

1219
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,000
I wouldn't do that,

1220
01:14:13,067 --> 01:14:14,767
But if my brothers
Were here,

1221
01:14:14,834 --> 01:14:17,968
They wouldn't mind asking
One little bit.

1222
01:14:18,033 --> 01:14:19,801
But I wouldn't ask.

1223
01:14:19,868 --> 01:14:22,133
No, no. Not you.

1224
01:14:24,634 --> 01:14:27,300
"they had swum a little
Distance away from the side

1225
01:14:27,367 --> 01:14:29,300
When a puff of wind
Stirred the sails."

1226
01:14:29,367 --> 01:14:32,968
"the boat gave a quiver,
And Jennifer jumped to her feet.

1227
01:14:33,033 --> 01:14:36,634
"suddenly, she realized
To her horror

1228
01:14:36,701 --> 01:14:38,634
"that the boat was moving.

1229
01:14:38,701 --> 01:14:41,000
"in terror,
She rushed to the side

1230
01:14:41,067 --> 01:14:42,200
And shouted, 'Peter!'"

1231
01:14:42,267 --> 01:14:44,467
Will Jennifer get mad
And slap Peter?

1232
01:14:44,534 --> 01:14:45,834
That's what I'd do.

1233
01:14:45,901 --> 01:14:47,767
No, no. She likes him.

1234
01:14:47,834 --> 01:14:49,434
Doesn't he like her?

1235
01:14:49,501 --> 01:14:52,167
Yes, he likes her
Very much.

1236
01:14:52,234 --> 01:14:55,934
But he won't know how much
Until a long time later.

1237
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,133
Will that be
In the book, too?

1238
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:02,200
No. No, that won't be
In the book.

1239
01:15:13,734 --> 01:15:16,267
On what platform does the
Dover express arrive, please?

1240
01:15:16,334 --> 01:15:17,767
Number five, Miss.

1241
01:15:17,834 --> 01:15:18,767
Thank you.

1242
01:15:33,267 --> 01:15:34,467
Kitty!

1243
01:15:34,534 --> 01:15:35,634
Gerald.

1244
01:15:39,534 --> 01:15:41,467
Gerald, I'm so glad.

1245
01:15:41,534 --> 01:15:43,133
I'm so glad, too.

1246
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:46,300
I didn't know-
I didn't know that you'd come.

1247
01:15:46,367 --> 01:15:49,234
Seeing you again
Means so much.

1248
01:15:51,701 --> 01:15:53,634
Mother-
Is-is mother here?

1249
01:15:53,701 --> 01:15:56,834
She's waiting. She
- she wanted me to see you first.

1250
01:15:56,901 --> 01:15:58,501
Oh, bless her.

1251
01:15:58,567 --> 01:16:01,167
We mustn't stand here.
Let's get your things.

1252
01:16:01,234 --> 01:16:03,834
Where's my porter?
There he is. Yes.

1253
01:16:03,901 --> 01:16:06,834
Father and granny
Are so anxious to see you.

1254
01:16:06,901 --> 01:16:08,834
Granny says that
No one plays cribbage

1255
01:16:08,901 --> 01:16:10,501
Quite as well as you.

1256
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:13,501
We told her that you might
Want to do a few other things,

1257
01:16:13,567 --> 01:16:15,400
But she wouldn't
Listen to that.

1258
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,601
Why didn't you
Come home before?

1259
01:16:21,667 --> 01:16:24,267
Why did it take you
So long?

1260
01:16:24,334 --> 01:16:27,601
I- I couldn't till I was all right
With myself.

1261
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:29,133
I know.

1262
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,934
I felt that too.

1263
01:16:32,701 --> 01:16:34,300
We were both wrong
That night.

1264
01:16:34,367 --> 01:16:35,634
I know that now.

1265
01:16:35,701 --> 01:16:37,968
It took me a long time
To find it out.

1266
01:16:38,033 --> 01:16:39,400
I wanted to come home.

1267
01:16:39,467 --> 01:16:42,133
I wanted to see you more
Than I could ever tell you,

1268
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,634
But I didn't know
What you felt.

1269
01:16:44,701 --> 01:16:46,601
I was afraid.

1270
01:16:47,868 --> 01:16:49,801
We've been friends
Ever since we were born.

1271
01:16:49,868 --> 01:16:52,300
We must never
Not be friends again.

1272
01:16:52,367 --> 01:16:53,501
Oh, no.

1273
01:17:00,701 --> 01:17:01,701
George?

1274
01:17:01,767 --> 01:17:04,501
Hello, roger! Hello!

1275
01:17:04,567 --> 01:17:06,334
I meant to be clean
And looking

1276
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,167
Like a tailor's dummy
To greet you.

1277
01:17:08,234 --> 01:17:10,000
I'm glad to see you
Again.

1278
01:17:10,067 --> 01:17:12,167
You're looking
Very fit, roger.

1279
01:17:12,234 --> 01:17:14,000
Thank you.
How are you, Miss west?

1280
01:17:14,067 --> 01:17:16,167
Very well, and very glad
To see you, sir George.

1281
01:17:16,234 --> 01:17:18,334
Mr. Saunders, bring the
Luggage in, will you?

1282
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,834
How's the new book
Coming on?

1283
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:21,834
We've made
A good start, I think.

1284
01:17:21,901 --> 01:17:23,667
I- oh, no,
We really have.

1285
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:33,167
I hope we've
A very long way to go.

1286
01:17:33,234 --> 01:17:34,334
I love this.

1287
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,033
You have
A long way to go-

1288
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:37,701
A good 10 miles yet.

1289
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,534
How lovely
The garden looks, roger.

1290
01:17:42,601 --> 01:17:44,534
And what a time
I'm going to have.

1291
01:17:44,601 --> 01:17:48,167
I shall do nothing but sleep and
Eat and read your latest book.

1292
01:17:50,601 --> 01:17:52,300
A tallyho!

1293
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:54,534
Neither of you were born
The first time I saw one.

1294
01:17:54,601 --> 01:17:56,200
It belongs to
Sir George mordaunt.

1295
01:17:56,267 --> 01:17:58,834
He's the m.f.h.
At bramwell.

1296
01:18:02,267 --> 01:18:04,868
Well, this is brandy.

1297
01:18:04,934 --> 01:18:07,200
Napoleon 1814.

1298
01:18:07,267 --> 01:18:10,067
It was princely of you,
George.

1299
01:18:10,133 --> 01:18:13,467
When I was a kid, I used to think
That napoleon made all this himself,

1300
01:18:13,534 --> 01:18:15,334
That he spent
That entire year

1301
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,234
Doing nothing
But making brandy.

1302
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:18,767
Well, the history books-

1303
01:18:20,634 --> 01:18:24,133
The history books could have
Told you differently.

1304
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,167
In those days,
I never could understand

1305
01:18:27,234 --> 01:18:29,334
How he had time
For waterloo-ha ha ha!-

1306
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,701
With all the brandy-making
Going on!

1307
01:18:32,767 --> 01:18:34,334
How is it?
Hmm?

1308
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,367
Oh.

1309
01:18:39,067 --> 01:18:40,367
Mmm. Not bad.

1310
01:18:41,901 --> 01:18:45,534
Roger, you were
In the engineers, weren't you?

1311
01:18:45,601 --> 01:18:46,868
Yes.

1312
01:18:46,934 --> 01:18:49,901
Did you ever run across
A chap called shannon?

1313
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,868
Yes, we were
In the same field company.

1314
01:18:55,934 --> 01:18:58,367
Do you remember
A photograph of yours

1315
01:18:58,434 --> 01:19:00,601
I gave back to you
When you left us?

1316
01:19:00,667 --> 01:19:02,601
Yes.

1317
01:19:02,667 --> 01:19:04,534
I think these are
The same people.

1318
01:19:04,601 --> 01:19:07,834
"Gerald shannon
And Kitty Vane."

1319
01:19:07,901 --> 01:19:09,400
Is that right?

1320
01:19:11,601 --> 01:19:14,100
There's a picture of them
Here in this tattler.

1321
01:19:15,901 --> 01:19:17,367
They're going to be married.

1322
01:19:19,567 --> 01:19:20,534
Are they?

1323
01:19:23,234 --> 01:19:25,033
I'm very glad.

1324
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:28,067
We used to be
Quite good friends.

1325
01:19:28,133 --> 01:19:32,167
They've-they've been
Very close to each other,

1326
01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:33,701
All their lives.

1327
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,300
I was hoping
This would happen.

1328
01:19:39,567 --> 01:19:42,968
It's the way it should be.

1329
01:19:46,067 --> 01:19:48,634
Well, me for bed, I think.

1330
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:51,033
I always like to
Turn in early the first night.

1331
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,534
How about you?

1332
01:19:52,601 --> 01:19:55,534
No, George, I think I shall
Have a short pipe first.

1333
01:19:55,601 --> 01:19:56,934
I'm tired.

1334
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,367
I've been working pretty
Hard the last few weeks.

1335
01:19:59,434 --> 01:20:01,367
Well, good night, old man. Good night.

1336
01:20:03,934 --> 01:20:07,234
George, when are they
To be married? Did you notice?

1337
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,234
I think it said
The 3rd.

1338
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:10,901
That's next monday.

1339
01:20:10,968 --> 01:20:12,367
Yes.

1340
01:20:12,434 --> 01:20:14,000
Well,
Good night, old man.

1341
01:20:14,067 --> 01:20:16,000
Good night, George.

1342
01:20:16,067 --> 01:20:17,968
Give me a shout
If you want anything.

1343
01:20:18,033 --> 01:20:19,033
Right.

1344
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:02,367
You've been standing there.

1345
01:21:02,434 --> 01:21:05,901
You haven't moved...
For a long time.

1346
01:21:23,534 --> 01:21:24,801
I was watching you.

1347
01:21:24,868 --> 01:21:28,100
I've never seen anyone
So still.

1348
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,367
I spoke to you,
But you didn't hear.

1349
01:21:34,734 --> 01:21:37,300
What are you
Thinking about, darling?

1350
01:21:52,734 --> 01:21:54,000
Shall we go in?

1351
01:21:54,067 --> 01:21:55,367
They're dancing.

1352
01:22:11,767 --> 01:22:14,133
Well, kids,
What's it to be today?

1353
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,634
One tree gulch!
One tree gulch!

1354
01:22:15,701 --> 01:22:16,968
That sounds
Exciting.

1355
01:22:17,033 --> 01:22:18,801
It's a dangerous spot,
George,

1356
01:22:18,868 --> 01:22:20,634
But we'll
Fix you up.

1357
01:22:20,701 --> 01:22:23,133
There's a dark pool
Beneath the tree.

1358
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,567
You can pretend to fish
And then go to sleep.

1359
01:22:25,634 --> 01:22:27,133
That
Sounds interesting.

1360
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,133
All right,
I'll sleep and fish

1361
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,133
While the braves
Watch over me.

1362
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,634
Look at my rod.

1363
01:22:32,701 --> 01:22:35,167
They wouldn't make mine
As good as theirs.

1364
01:22:35,234 --> 01:22:37,000
It's much too short.

1365
01:22:37,067 --> 01:22:38,567
The fish won't care.

1366
01:22:43,734 --> 01:22:46,000
There's danger ahead!

1367
01:22:46,067 --> 01:22:49,167
Pass the word-
Ware crocodiles!

1368
01:22:49,234 --> 01:22:51,334
Ware crocodiles.

1369
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,234
Ware crocodiles!

1370
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:55,167
Well, look!

1371
01:22:55,234 --> 01:22:57,834
Didn't I say
There was danger?

1372
01:22:57,901 --> 01:23:01,634
Look! The hounds,
The hounds, the hounds!

1373
01:23:20,667 --> 01:23:23,300
Look!
Isn't that beautiful?

1374
01:23:23,367 --> 01:23:26,100
Is he going to make it?
There's a lovely jump!

1375
01:23:30,434 --> 01:23:31,767
Isn't this
A beautiful sight?

1376
01:23:31,834 --> 01:23:32,767
Yes, isn't it?

1377
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:47,400
They're coming this way!
They're coming very close!

1378
01:23:47,467 --> 01:23:48,400
Really?

1379
01:23:48,467 --> 01:23:51,133
They're coming
Very close.

1380
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:55,767
What a nasty fall!

1381
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:58,300
He's up again!

1382
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,200
There's a fine jump.

1383
01:24:05,968 --> 01:24:06,901
Look!

1384
01:24:06,968 --> 01:24:08,033
It's a lady!

1385
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:10,200
Let's see if we can
Be some help.

1386
01:24:13,634 --> 01:24:16,334
Joe, run and dip my
Handkerchief in the stream.

1387
01:24:25,934 --> 01:24:27,634
Is she all right?

1388
01:24:27,701 --> 01:24:29,300
I don't know.

1389
01:24:29,367 --> 01:24:31,300
She's lying
Very still.

1390
01:24:31,367 --> 01:24:33,534
Joe's gone
For the water.

1391
01:24:38,267 --> 01:24:39,667
Is she hurt, George?

1392
01:24:39,734 --> 01:24:41,400
I don't think so.
It's just a tumble.

1393
01:24:41,467 --> 01:24:42,634
Is she conscious?

1394
01:24:42,701 --> 01:24:44,467
No, she's stunned,
I imagine.

1395
01:24:44,534 --> 01:24:47,567
She's coming to, though.

1396
01:24:47,634 --> 01:24:50,467
Take it easy now.
Feeling better?

1397
01:24:51,667 --> 01:24:53,434
That was quite a fall,
Wasn't it?

1398
01:24:57,467 --> 01:24:59,400
Who is it?

1399
01:24:59,467 --> 01:25:00,467
Kitty!

1400
01:25:00,534 --> 01:25:02,033
It's Kitty Vane!

1401
01:25:03,801 --> 01:25:05,501
Oh, you poor dear,
Are you hurt?

1402
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:08,033
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1403
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,334
Not at all, sir.
Glad to have been some help.

1404
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,767
Are you sure
You're not hurt?

1405
01:25:11,834 --> 01:25:14,200
No, really.

1406
01:25:14,267 --> 01:25:17,234
A fine exhibition, wasn't it?

1407
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:18,567
Oh,
Just rotten luck.

1408
01:25:18,634 --> 01:25:20,567
I told you that horse
Was a bad one with water,

1409
01:25:20,634 --> 01:25:22,167
But you would ride him.

1410
01:25:22,234 --> 01:25:23,901
George?
Yes, old man?

1411
01:25:23,968 --> 01:25:25,634
Kitty,
Are you all right?

1412
01:25:25,701 --> 01:25:27,501
What a fright
You gave me.

1413
01:25:27,567 --> 01:25:29,634
Get me away from here
At once. At once!

1414
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,801
I think I've been
Lying here long enough.

1415
01:25:34,901 --> 01:25:36,234
There you are.

1416
01:25:39,534 --> 01:25:41,467
You're as white
As a sheet.

1417
01:25:41,534 --> 01:25:42,767
So are you, darling.

1418
01:25:47,701 --> 01:25:50,000
Why the devil
Must they hunt over here?

1419
01:25:50,067 --> 01:25:52,200
They've never
Done it before.

1420
01:25:52,267 --> 01:25:54,300
Only a couple of miles
From home,

1421
01:25:54,367 --> 01:25:56,501
And I run slap
Into her!

1422
01:25:56,567 --> 01:25:58,467
And you want me
To mix with people.

1423
01:25:58,534 --> 01:26:00,901
I ought to put a
Thousand miles between us.

1424
01:26:00,968 --> 01:26:03,868
I knew that from the start,
Only I hadn't the guts.

1425
01:26:03,934 --> 01:26:05,901
I will now.

1426
01:26:05,968 --> 01:26:07,901
I'll get right away,

1427
01:26:07,968 --> 01:26:11,000
Right away from any chance
Of ever seeing her again.

1428
01:26:15,667 --> 01:26:17,701
I've lied to myself,
George.

1429
01:26:17,767 --> 01:26:20,601
I've pretended
That I've made a life,

1430
01:26:20,667 --> 01:26:22,267
That I was happy.

1431
01:26:22,334 --> 01:26:26,567
And today
I've found myself out.

1432
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,968
The work of all those years
Is thrown away!

1433
01:26:31,033 --> 01:26:32,868
Tough luck, roger.

1434
01:26:32,934 --> 01:26:34,467
Terribly tough.

1435
01:26:39,868 --> 01:26:42,167
Sorry, old man,
I let go.

1436
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:47,667
I ought to be darn well
Ashamed of myself.

1437
01:26:50,901 --> 01:26:52,834
Take a stroll
In the garden,

1438
01:26:52,901 --> 01:26:54,200
Cool off.

1439
01:27:03,234 --> 01:27:05,167
I'm glad you were
There today, George.

1440
01:27:05,234 --> 01:27:07,100
Thank you
For what you did.

1441
01:27:08,067 --> 01:27:10,000
Wasn't much hurt,
Was she?

1442
01:27:10,067 --> 01:27:12,701
No, old man. Just a
Tumble and a scratch.

1443
01:27:12,767 --> 01:27:14,934
She was very plucky
About it.

1444
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,501
Ha ha!
I'll bet she was!

1445
01:27:17,567 --> 01:27:20,667
I'll bet she's kicking
Herself for coming off.

1446
01:27:20,734 --> 01:27:23,334
She's ridden
Ever since she was six.

1447
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,300
Probably her first spill.

1448
01:27:27,067 --> 01:27:28,701
And I was there.

1449
01:27:30,901 --> 01:27:32,367
Was I, uh...

1450
01:27:33,901 --> 01:27:35,667
Was I very close to her?

1451
01:27:35,734 --> 01:27:38,667
Yes.
Yes, quite close.

1452
01:27:40,767 --> 01:27:42,200
Easy to lift, isn't she?

1453
01:27:42,267 --> 01:27:44,367
So tiny,
Such a little thing.

1454
01:27:44,434 --> 01:27:46,334
And very pretty.

1455
01:27:50,267 --> 01:27:51,567
Very pretty.

1456
01:28:39,067 --> 01:28:40,667
Roger Crane?

1457
01:28:40,734 --> 01:28:42,534
Well, I suppose
He ought to know.

1458
01:28:42,601 --> 01:28:44,334
I wish I could
Remember the name.

1459
01:28:45,767 --> 01:28:46,701
Yes.

1460
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:50,701
Yes, two years is a long time.
Let me think now.

1461
01:28:51,767 --> 01:28:52,701
Crane.

1462
01:28:54,667 --> 01:28:57,367
Well, I'm sorry. Doesn't mean
Anything to me. Not a thing.

1463
01:28:57,434 --> 01:28:59,834
He's quite certain
He was in my regiment?

1464
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:06,000
Can't I speak to him?

1465
01:29:08,434 --> 01:29:10,367
Very well,
If he'd rather not.

1466
01:29:10,434 --> 01:29:12,367
But of course I don't mind.

1467
01:29:12,434 --> 01:29:15,634
Tell Mr. Crane I'd be delighted
To come and call on him any day.

1468
01:29:15,701 --> 01:29:17,033
How about tomorrow?

1469
01:29:19,901 --> 01:29:22,200
Now? At once?

1470
01:29:23,901 --> 01:29:26,334
All right, if you
Really think I ought to.

1471
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,868
You sound very serious.

1472
01:29:31,067 --> 01:29:33,801
Tell me,
What does he look like?

1473
01:29:39,234 --> 01:29:43,667
Yes, I remember
The photograph.

1474
01:29:43,734 --> 01:29:45,033
A snapshot.

1475
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,367
It must be.

1476
01:29:50,434 --> 01:29:52,634
Please...
Please give me the address.

1477
01:29:55,434 --> 01:29:59,000
Rosemary cottage.

1478
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:02,601
Foxley heath.

1479
01:30:05,868 --> 01:30:07,667
I'll be with you
In about an hour.

1480
01:30:15,934 --> 01:30:17,667
You've been away so long.

1481
01:30:20,868 --> 01:30:22,133
What is it, Gerald?

1482
01:30:25,234 --> 01:30:27,334
You look as though
You've seen a ghost.

1483
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:30,000
Is... Anything wrong?

1484
01:30:30,067 --> 01:30:31,334
No.

1485
01:30:36,567 --> 01:30:38,534
Kitty, how much do you...

1486
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:40,968
There is something.

1487
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:44,667
Can't you tell me?

1488
01:30:45,767 --> 01:30:48,701
I must, Kitty. It's Alan.

1489
01:30:54,734 --> 01:30:55,934
Alan.

1490
01:30:56,033 --> 01:30:57,734
He's alive.

1491
01:31:03,601 --> 01:31:04,634
Alive.

1492
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:08,868
I'm going to
Take you to him.

1493
01:31:13,767 --> 01:31:15,567
I knew it.

1494
01:31:23,868 --> 01:31:26,133
Please try to understand
Why I did it.

1495
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:29,667
I had to see you
Get this straight.

1496
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:31,501
I don't know
What it's going to do

1497
01:31:31,567 --> 01:31:33,167
To your feelings for me.

1498
01:31:33,234 --> 01:31:35,300
I do hope not too much.

1499
01:31:42,734 --> 01:31:44,100
Did you...

1500
01:31:46,033 --> 01:31:48,234
Did you tell him
I was blind?

1501
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:49,501
No.

1502
01:31:49,567 --> 01:31:51,000
Just that you were here.

1503
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:54,834
Is he... Coming alone?

1504
01:31:54,901 --> 01:31:56,133
I don't know.

1505
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:57,567
He didn't say.

1506
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:23,300
Miss West.

1507
01:32:25,934 --> 01:32:26,868
Miss West.

1508
01:32:26,934 --> 01:32:28,634
Yes, Mr. Crane?

1509
01:32:28,701 --> 01:32:29,968
Come in, please.

1510
01:32:32,067 --> 01:32:34,300
Is the room
As it usually is?

1511
01:32:34,367 --> 01:32:37,000
Why... Why yes,
Mr. Crane.

1512
01:32:37,067 --> 01:32:39,000
I've got to be
Absolutely certain.

1513
01:32:39,067 --> 01:32:40,501
Have a good look.

1514
01:32:40,567 --> 01:32:42,934
Is anything
Out of its place?

1515
01:32:44,567 --> 01:32:45,834
No.

1516
01:32:45,901 --> 01:32:48,367
No, nothing at all.
You're quite sure?

1517
01:32:48,434 --> 01:32:50,000
Yes. Quite.

1518
01:32:50,067 --> 01:32:51,901
What's in
The yellow bowl today?

1519
01:32:51,968 --> 01:32:53,501
Roses.

1520
01:32:53,567 --> 01:32:55,033
Yellow roses.

1521
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:58,701
Perhaps you had better
Put another chair here.

1522
01:33:03,901 --> 01:33:07,667
Oh, Miss west, I want you
To put my braille books away.

1523
01:33:07,734 --> 01:33:09,033
All of them.

1524
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:12,200
I think you'll find one
There beside my chair.

1525
01:33:13,434 --> 01:33:15,300
Is there
Anything more, Mr. Crane?

1526
01:33:15,367 --> 01:33:16,634
No, thank you.

1527
01:33:16,701 --> 01:33:19,634
Wait. There was a copy
Of this week's tattler.

1528
01:33:19,701 --> 01:33:21,934
It's on the table
Behind you.

1529
01:33:23,601 --> 01:33:26,300
And bring in some drinks soon
And put them on the desk, please,

1530
01:33:26,367 --> 01:33:27,968
And stir up the fire.

1531
01:33:28,033 --> 01:33:29,634
I'm expecting visitors.

1532
01:33:29,701 --> 01:33:31,634
Very well, Mr. Crane.

1533
01:34:25,534 --> 01:34:27,300
Yes, Miss west,
What is it?

1534
01:34:27,367 --> 01:34:30,834
Why, I brought the drinks.
Am I disturbing you?

1535
01:34:30,901 --> 01:34:32,501
No, no.

1536
01:34:54,067 --> 01:34:57,167
Is there anything else
I can do, Mr. Crane?

1537
01:34:57,234 --> 01:34:58,334
Anything?

1538
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,968
No. Thank you.

1539
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:06,667
Miss west, what's it like
To live year in, year out

1540
01:35:06,734 --> 01:35:08,467
In the company
Of a blind man?

1541
01:35:08,534 --> 01:35:12,968
Oh, but I don't think of you
As blind, Mr. Crane.

1542
01:35:13,033 --> 01:35:14,133
You don't?

1543
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:15,501
Well, think-

1544
01:35:17,334 --> 01:35:20,100
Aren't you keeping an eye out every
Minute for fear I should blunder,

1545
01:35:20,167 --> 01:35:23,634
Watching your tongue every minute
For fear you'll say something

1546
01:35:23,701 --> 01:35:25,501
That might hurt my feelings?

1547
01:35:25,567 --> 01:35:26,567
Cut off from-

1548
01:35:37,033 --> 01:35:38,467
Here they are.

1549
01:35:38,534 --> 01:35:40,567
They?

1550
01:35:40,634 --> 01:35:43,167
Yes. A lady
And a gentleman.

1551
01:35:45,534 --> 01:35:46,801
A lady?

1552
01:35:46,868 --> 01:35:48,734
Young?

1553
01:35:48,801 --> 01:35:50,400
Small and dark.

1554
01:35:50,467 --> 01:35:52,534
And pretty.

1555
01:35:52,601 --> 01:35:54,267
I'll go and let them in.

1556
01:36:00,901 --> 01:36:02,067
Mr. Crane?

1557
01:36:02,133 --> 01:36:03,667
Yes.
He's expecting you.

1558
01:36:03,734 --> 01:36:05,000
Will you come in?

1559
01:36:05,067 --> 01:36:06,467
Thank you.

1560
01:36:13,567 --> 01:36:14,767
Alan!
Alan, old man!

1561
01:36:14,834 --> 01:36:16,567
Kitty, Gerald!

1562
01:36:17,667 --> 01:36:18,968
Oh!
Alan!

1563
01:36:19,033 --> 01:36:21,267
Kitty.
Oh, Alan.

1564
01:36:21,334 --> 01:36:22,400
Alan.

1565
01:36:24,334 --> 01:36:27,234
It's really,
Really you.

1566
01:36:28,667 --> 01:36:31,300
I always knew that
Somewhere, sometime...

1567
01:36:31,367 --> 01:36:32,634
We should meet again?

1568
01:36:32,701 --> 01:36:34,634
Yes, I think I
Always knew it, too.

1569
01:36:34,701 --> 01:36:38,968
The three of us.
I'm so happy to see you both.

1570
01:36:39,033 --> 01:36:41,434
Sit down, Kitty.
This is a comfortable chair.

1571
01:36:41,501 --> 01:36:43,634
Gerald, old boy,
Sit down, sit down.

1572
01:36:43,701 --> 01:36:45,467
You'll have a drink,
Won't you?

1573
01:36:45,534 --> 01:36:47,467
The cigarettes are right there
Beside you, Gerald.

1574
01:36:47,534 --> 01:36:48,834
Alan...

1575
01:36:49,934 --> 01:36:51,968
You've so much
To tell us.

1576
01:36:52,033 --> 01:36:53,968
Yes, old man.

1577
01:36:54,033 --> 01:36:55,801
Well, it's a long story.

1578
01:36:55,868 --> 01:36:57,467
I want to hear
About you.

1579
01:36:57,534 --> 01:36:59,801
How's aunt Sheila?
How's everything?

1580
01:36:59,868 --> 01:37:02,634
I'll keep you here
For days telling me.

1581
01:37:02,701 --> 01:37:04,667
Give Kitty
A cigarette, Gerald.

1582
01:37:04,734 --> 01:37:06,167
Matches are
Right there beside you.

1583
01:37:06,234 --> 01:37:08,000
Thanks. I have some.

1584
01:37:08,067 --> 01:37:09,334
Where have you been?

1585
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:12,334
Well, I've been here.
I've been a writer.

1586
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:15,667
Remember when we were kids, I was
Going to write like shakespeare?

1587
01:37:15,734 --> 01:37:18,167
Ha ha ha! Well,
I'm not shakespeare.

1588
01:37:18,234 --> 01:37:20,667
I, uh,
Write books for children.

1589
01:37:20,734 --> 01:37:22,334
I like doing it,

1590
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,167
And I've done
Fairly well with it.

1591
01:37:24,234 --> 01:37:26,834
Oh, I don't mean that I'm
Any great shakes at it,

1592
01:37:26,901 --> 01:37:29,968
But the first book
Sold pretty well, and, uh...

1593
01:37:30,033 --> 01:37:31,334
Kitty, like much soda?

1594
01:37:34,567 --> 01:37:35,767
Here we are.

1595
01:37:38,934 --> 01:37:41,534
But, Alan, why?
It's about right?

1596
01:37:42,934 --> 01:37:43,901
Gerald.

1597
01:37:45,434 --> 01:37:47,067
Thanks.

1598
01:37:47,133 --> 01:37:49,234
Sit down, old boy,
Sit down.

1599
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:58,033
Mind if I have a pipe?

1600
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:00,200
I'll show you
Around my garden later.

1601
01:38:00,267 --> 01:38:02,334
I'm terribly proud
Of my roses.

1602
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:05,367
Alan...
What's happened to us?

1603
01:38:05,434 --> 01:38:08,701
Why are you holding us off?

1604
01:38:08,767 --> 01:38:10,901
I found your engagement
In the tattler.

1605
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:13,234
I was so delighted
When I saw your picture.

1606
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:15,501
It's right there
Beside you, Gerald.

1607
01:38:15,567 --> 01:38:17,767
And here's something I've
Been wanting to do ever since.

1608
01:38:19,567 --> 01:38:22,334
My love to you both.

1609
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,767
And I hope you'll be
Very, very happy.

1610
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:37,667
Is that it?

1611
01:38:37,734 --> 01:38:40,334
Is that why you
Sit there torturing us?

1612
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:43,367
It doesn't explain anything.
It doesn't excuse anything.

1613
01:38:43,434 --> 01:38:45,534
Do you realize
That for three years

1614
01:38:45,601 --> 01:38:48,467
You let us
Believe you were dead.

1615
01:38:48,534 --> 01:38:50,868
Mother... Kitty...

1616
01:38:50,934 --> 01:38:52,367
Kitty!

1617
01:38:52,434 --> 01:38:54,033
Do you know
What that's meant?

1618
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:55,534
Do you know
What we've suffered?

1619
01:38:55,601 --> 01:38:57,367
Why have you done it?

1620
01:38:57,434 --> 01:39:01,567
And now we come here
After all this time and...

1621
01:39:01,634 --> 01:39:03,367
We're strangers.

1622
01:39:03,434 --> 01:39:05,100
If it's because...

1623
01:39:06,467 --> 01:39:08,534
Alan, you've only to
Look at Kitty's face

1624
01:39:08,601 --> 01:39:11,033
To know what you're doing
To her, to know that she's-

1625
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:13,501
No, no.
Please don't.

1626
01:39:16,067 --> 01:39:17,000
Gerald...

1627
01:39:18,868 --> 01:39:21,033
I want to talk
To Alan alone.

1628
01:39:22,167 --> 01:39:24,801
But I-
I see no reason.

1629
01:39:37,968 --> 01:39:38,934
Alan...

1630
01:39:41,067 --> 01:39:42,367
Tell me now.

1631
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:48,501
Well, there's
Nothing to tell, really.

1632
01:39:48,567 --> 01:39:50,200
You've suffered, darling.

1633
01:39:50,267 --> 01:39:52,534
Something's hurt you.

1634
01:39:52,601 --> 01:39:54,000
Won't you tell me?

1635
01:39:56,601 --> 01:39:59,667
Alan, why didn't you
Come home?

1636
01:40:04,267 --> 01:40:05,701
It's hard
To tell you, Kitty,

1637
01:40:05,767 --> 01:40:07,667
But I've got to.

1638
01:40:09,267 --> 01:40:11,167
See, the war
Did something to me.

1639
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,701
I've changed.

1640
01:40:14,767 --> 01:40:16,300
Changed?

1641
01:40:17,534 --> 01:40:19,467
Well, after all,
A war doesn't leave you

1642
01:40:19,534 --> 01:40:21,467
Quite where it finds you,
Does it?

1643
01:40:21,534 --> 01:40:25,501
I spent several months
In a german hospital,

1644
01:40:25,567 --> 01:40:28,133
And months in a prison camp...

1645
01:40:29,901 --> 01:40:33,300
When I came out, I wanted
To be alone for a while.

1646
01:40:34,901 --> 01:40:38,467
I wanted to...
Start all over again...

1647
01:40:39,567 --> 01:40:40,968
To build a new life...

1648
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:44,234
Sort of away
From old friends and...

1649
01:40:45,901 --> 01:40:47,000
Old memories.

1650
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:49,634
So I came here.

1651
01:40:51,901 --> 01:40:54,467
I always meant to
Come home sometime, but I-

1652
01:40:56,067 --> 01:40:58,701
I liked it here,
And I got used to it.

1653
01:40:58,767 --> 01:41:01,067
Well, I just didn't
Come back.

1654
01:41:02,601 --> 01:41:03,868
You found...

1655
01:41:03,934 --> 01:41:06,868
When... When you found...

1656
01:41:06,934 --> 01:41:09,000
You'd stopped loving me?

1657
01:41:10,434 --> 01:41:12,367
That was it, Alan?

1658
01:41:12,434 --> 01:41:13,901
I love you, Kitty.

1659
01:41:15,367 --> 01:41:16,868
I loved you then...

1660
01:41:17,968 --> 01:41:21,434
But in a different way,
I suppose.

1661
01:41:23,701 --> 01:41:25,934
I didn't have
Courage enough to tell you.

1662
01:41:27,534 --> 01:41:28,534
I see.

1663
01:41:28,601 --> 01:41:30,234
I understand.

1664
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:33,300
Forgive me, Alan.
I've been tormenting you.

1665
01:41:35,901 --> 01:41:38,167
This means we won't...

1666
01:41:38,234 --> 01:41:41,801
We won't...
See each other again.

1667
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:44,367
Yes.

1668
01:41:46,067 --> 01:41:48,000
But before that happens,

1669
01:41:48,067 --> 01:41:50,000
I want to tell you

1670
01:41:50,067 --> 01:41:51,501
That I loved you then.

1671
01:41:51,567 --> 01:41:55,334
I love you now as much.

1672
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,868
I love you with all my heart.

1673
01:42:00,067 --> 01:42:01,834
I've never loved
Anyone else.

1674
01:42:01,901 --> 01:42:03,400
I never will again.

1675
01:42:07,501 --> 01:42:08,667
Goodbye.

1676
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:15,601
Goodbye, Kitty.

1677
01:42:40,067 --> 01:42:41,033
Alan.

1678
01:42:42,067 --> 01:42:43,033
Goodbye, Gerald.

1679
01:42:44,567 --> 01:42:47,033
Be happy, both of you.

1680
01:42:48,734 --> 01:42:49,701
Goodbye.

1681
01:43:48,567 --> 01:43:50,300
Is that you, Miss west?

1682
01:43:55,067 --> 01:43:56,767
You must excuse me.

1683
01:43:58,400 --> 01:43:59,601
I'm tired.

1684
01:44:03,901 --> 01:44:05,701
Desperately tired.

1685
01:44:15,767 --> 01:44:17,601
We won't do
Any work tonight.

1686
01:44:19,701 --> 01:44:21,868
I wanted to talk to you.

1687
01:44:23,434 --> 01:44:25,634
I've been thinking lately
Of going away...

1688
01:44:25,701 --> 01:44:27,667
Leaving the country.

1689
01:44:30,868 --> 01:44:33,501
There are reasons,
Unfortunately.

1690
01:44:37,033 --> 01:44:38,734
I shall Miss you.

1691
01:44:38,801 --> 01:44:40,267
You've been very kind.

1692
01:44:41,868 --> 01:44:43,334
But of course...

1693
01:44:45,534 --> 01:44:46,834
Miss west?

1694
01:44:49,167 --> 01:44:50,701
Miss west?

1695
01:44:51,801 --> 01:44:53,033
Alan!

1696
01:44:58,467 --> 01:45:00,167
Oh, my darling!
My darling!

1697
01:45:00,234 --> 01:45:02,167
Kitty!
Kitty, you-

1698
01:45:02,234 --> 01:45:04,167
Darling, I know.
That was why, wasn't it?

1699
01:45:04,234 --> 01:45:06,000
Kitty,
Think what it means.

1700
01:45:06,067 --> 01:45:07,501
It means life again.

1701
01:45:07,567 --> 01:45:10,834
I've been dead. Oh,
Dearest, it was cruel of you.

1702
01:45:10,901 --> 01:45:12,501
How could you know me
So little?

1703
01:45:12,567 --> 01:45:14,434
Will you listen to me?
No, I won't!

1704
01:45:14,501 --> 01:45:15,801
I won't!

1705
01:45:15,868 --> 01:45:18,601
You told me once
Never to stop watching you,

1706
01:45:18,667 --> 01:45:20,100
Never to go away.

1707
01:45:20,167 --> 01:45:21,934
I never will.
Never.

1708
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,801
You may as well
Face it, darling-

1709
01:45:23,868 --> 01:45:25,968
You'll never be alone again.

1710
01:45:26,033 --> 01:45:27,467
Wherever you are,

1711
01:45:27,534 --> 01:45:29,501
I'll be with you always.

1712
01:45:30,868 --> 01:45:31,834
Always.

1713
01:45:35,033 --> 01:45:37,634
I never could
Escape from you, could I?

1714
01:45:37,701 --> 01:45:38,701
Never.

1715
01:45:38,767 --> 01:45:40,634
You were always
Popping up.

1716
01:45:40,701 --> 01:45:41,968
Always.

1717
01:45:42,033 --> 01:45:45,100
Thank heaven
You popped up this time.

1718
01:45:46,534 --> 01:45:47,767
Thank heaven.

1719
01:45:48,305 --> 01:45:54,864
