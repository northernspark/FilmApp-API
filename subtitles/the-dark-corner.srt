2
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,749
- Galt in?
- He's in the building someplace.

3
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,559
He'll be right back. May I help you?

4
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,835
Lieutenant Reeves.

5
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,151
<i>Maybe you can help me,
if you know anything I want to know.</i>

6
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,835
I don't know anything
you couldn't find out by asking Mr Galt.

7
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,480
Nice quality, loyalty.

8
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,399
- How long have you been working for him?
- Several weeks.

9
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,952
- What do you know about him?
- I like him.

10
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,235
Keep you busy?

11
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,471
I sharpen pencils, do the typing,
answer the phone,

12
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,120
and mind my own business.

13
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,196
Well, look who's here.

14
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,350
Hello, Reeves.

15
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,799
- What are you working on?
- My income tax.

16
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,355
Get to the point, Reeves. What do you want?

17
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,880
Why didn't you let me know
you were moving offices?

18
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,997
Why should I?
I notified the commissioner of licences.

19
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,911
- But you didn't notify me. I wanna know too.
- Why?

20
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,230
I've taken a personal interest in you.

21
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,949
I promised my friends in California
to see you didn't get into mischief.

22
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,157
You're an impulsive youth, you know.

23
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,394
Look. I got a fast shuffle out West.

24
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,439
Now all I'm asking is a fair chance
to work up a legitimate business.

25
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,149
I'm playing this by the book,
and I won't even trip over a comma.

26
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,276
I hope not. You got a nice setup.

27
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,108
Good view... and a good-looking secretary.

28
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,760
You'd be smart to keep it clean.

29
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,835
It's nearly six. I'd like to leave now,
if there's nothing else.

30
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,836
There is.

31
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,114
Yes?

32
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,760
Have dinner with me.

33
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,350
Is this part of the job?

34
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,556
It is tonight.

35
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,438
Being a private detective, I don't suppose you
could uncover a pair of nylons somewhere?

36
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,351
I'll make a note of it.

37
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,638
Working conditions
are certainly looking up around here.

38
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,632
<i>Watch the lady hit the ball.
There she comes. It's a foul ball.</i>

39
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,156
All right, she doesn't know her own strength.

40
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,151
You're out, lady!

41
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,231
How about it?

42
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,359
Come on, step up. Who wants
to hit the ball next? Right this way.

43
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,829
Say, that was OK.

44
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,118
- How do you do that after all that chop suey?
- My father was a major-league umpire.

45
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,588
- Well, what else can I beat you at?
- What kind of games do you like to play?

46
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,752
You know, we got some great playgrounds
around 52nd Street.

47
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,638
- Among them your apartment?
- Just a coincidence.

48
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,429
I haven't worked for you long,
but I know when you're pitching a curve,

49
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,672
- and I always carry a catcher's mitt.
- No offence. A guy's got to try to score.

50
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,709
Not in my league. "I don't play for score,
I play for keeps," said she with a smile.

51
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,236
Say, you wanna give me some change?
Ten pennies.

52
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,232
<i>Win something
every time you pull a string.</i>

53
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,396
- Hey. Let's take a look at the competition.
- All right.

54
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,075
- Here.
- Oh, gimme another one.

55
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,874
I might fire you and get a Tahitian secretary.

56
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,317
You won't like 'em,
those grass skirts are a fire hazard.

57
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,955
Oh.

58
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,600
Aren't any of these for women?

59
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,078
Hey, now here's a nice secretary.

60
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,677
- Mr Galt?
- Don't worry, I'm not gonna fire you.

61
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,910
Mr Galt, I think someone's following us.

62
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,913
Yeah, I know. Guy in a white suit.
About five foot ten, brown hair.

63
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,560
Sports shoes. Ring on his left pinkie.

64
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,108
Don't stare back.

65
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,795
Let's go.

66
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,953
- I've never been followed before.
- A terrible reflection on American manhood.

67
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,795
- Why is he following us?
- Maybe he likes your big blue eyes.

68
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,873
- Look.
- Hm.

69
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,748
I'll put you in a cab. Go round the block
and park across from our office.

70
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,230
- What then?
- I'll ask him to the office for choir practice.

71
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,632
If he's sings nicely, I'll revive him. When he
leaves, follow him. Tell me where he goes.

72
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,915
OK. But...

73
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,072
- What have you been doing?
- What do you think I've been doing?

74
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,914
You could've been doing a lot of things.
You're stubborn and impulsive

75
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,356
and you think you're tough.
You've got some blind spots too.

76
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,556
Yeah? Name one.

77
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,315
Sentiment about women, for instance.
You're afraid of emotion.

78
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,436
You keep your heart in a steel safe.

79
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,034
I suppose you're the blowtorch type.

80
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,998
I can be warm.

81
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,914
<i>Good night, Mr Galt.</i>

82
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,118
<i>Good night, Kathleen.
See you in the morning. OK, driver.</i>

83
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,118
Hey.

84
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,228
There's a pepper pot under the hat, buster.
Let's take a walk.

85
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,954
Face the wall.

86
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,513
Legs apart.

87
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,989
Lean against it.

88
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,715
All right, shell out.

89
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,872
<i>Make nice brass knuckles, don't they?</i>

90
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,155
Brass knucks ain't legal.

91
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,118
I just carry my change the hard way.

92
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,875
All right. Let's play twenty questions.

93
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,270
You answer them correctly,
maybe I won't knock your teeth out.

94
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,999
We'll start easy. What's your racket?

95
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,799
Same as yours. Private dick.

96
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,993
That's the wrong answer.

97
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,469
We don't go on a job without a licence.

98
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,755
I left it home.

99
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,915
OK. Let me coax you.

100
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,833
I can do it the hard way.

101
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,755
- How long you been shagging me?
- Two days. I was in your pocket all the time.

102
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,798
- Who buys the tickets?
- A client.

103
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,394
I don't know his name. He pays me by mail.

104
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,278
You know I can't tell you his name.
It ain't ethical.

105
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,239
Yeah, sure. You and me both,
we're up to our ears in ethics.

106
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,390
Argh!

107
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,430
What's his name? Who's paying ya?

108
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,960
<i> Jardine.</i>

109
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,554
Come again?

110
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,631
Anthony Jardine.

111
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,549
What's he look like?

112
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,108
Tall. Yellow hair.

113
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,031
Fancy dresser.

114
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,157
Thinks he's class on a stick.

115
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,915
- Where do you live?
- With my brother-in-law on 23rd Street.

116
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,275
What's his phone number?

117
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,035
<i>Chelsea. 043510.</i>

118
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,479
<i>- Yeah?
- Fred Foss there?</i>

119
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,835
<i>- He ain't here.
- When will he be back?</i>

120
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,354
<i>I don't know. Want me to tell him something?</i>

121
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,476
No.

122
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,792
I catch you shagging me again,
I'll ram these right down your throat.

123
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,918
Here. Get the suit cleaned.
Jardine's particular about neatness.

124
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,551
I keep this. I got a poor memory
for names and numbers.

125
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,950
I may want to look you up again sometime.

126
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,870
Hey. This cab's taken, buddy.

127
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,754
Aww!

128
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,709
Did you lose him?

129
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,791
That's fine.

130
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,758
You should have William Powell
for a secretary.

131
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,831
William Powell, who's he?

132
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,993
<i>Don't you ever go to the movies?
He's a detective in The Thin Man.</i>

133
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,119
That's pretty hot ginger ale you're mixing up.

134
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,109
- Who was that man?
- White Suit?

135
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,316
- Yeah.
- Just hired muscle.

136
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,393
- Who hired him?
- Forget it. You'll be better off.

137
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,914
Had the smell of Judas on me
since I touched him.

138
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,356
Who? Come on, open up that steel safe.
I wanna know and I wanna help.

139
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,113
I can't, baby.

140
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,236
But that's...

141
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,153
that's awful good talk.

142
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,993
I like it.

143
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,235
Listen.

144
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,678
If you don't wanna lose that stardust look
in your eyes, go while the door's still open.

145
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:19,312
You stick around here, you'll get grafters,
shysters, two-bit thugs, maybe worse.

146
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,470
Maybe me.

147
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,359
I like those odds. I'll take them.

148
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,635
And I'm staying.

149
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,996
Whatever this is,
I've got a feeling you can handle it.

150
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,958
And I like your style, Mr Galt.

151
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,276
Thanks, Kathleen.

152
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,030
Having said my little piece,
I think it's time for me to go home now.

153
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,511
- See you in the morning, boss.
- Hadn't you better start calling me Brad?

154
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,831
Say, about those nylons. What size?

155
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,831
Nines.

156
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,673
I'll make a note of it.

157
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,990
Night.

158
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,273
- Good evening, Mr Jardine.
- Evening, Henry.

159
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,079
Good evening, Mr Jardine.

160
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,952
- Mrs Reynolds, so nice to see you.
- What a lovely party. This reminds me...

161
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,430
Yes. Mrs Cathcart's in the ballroom.
Hello, Jardine.

162
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,512
I practically live here.
I shouldn't bother to leave.

163
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,637
A delight to have you.
You're dining with us tomorrow too.

164
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,076
Oh, yes, thank you. I'll be here.
Where's Mari?

165
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,755
She's inside somewhere.
Wasting her charm on a lot of dullards.

166
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,956
Shall we go in?

167
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,353
<i>Ah. Guten Abend, Frau Keller.</i>

168
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,594
The wife of the Austrian critic. She looks like
she's been out in the rain feeding the poultry.

169
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,353
- Mrs Kingsley, Mr Jardine.
- How do you do?

170
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,352
- You know Lucy Wilding.
- Nice to see you.

171
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,435
- Mr and Mrs Bryson.
- How do you do?

172
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,193
And the woman
who brightens my reclining years.

173
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,999
Don't exaggerate.
It's only our third anniversary.

174
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,469
You're not decrepit yet, old boy.

175
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,236
Then why do I detect a rather tactless
emphasis on that "old boy"?

176
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,278
We present the perfect picture
of Beauty and the Beast.

177
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,430
You can be a beast at times, Hardy.

178
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,909
As long as I'm amusing, you'll forgive me.

179
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,753
But senility is unforgivable.

180
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,039
Stop talking like a fool. You're the most
attractive man in the room and you know it.

181
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,318
Remind me to tell you, my dear,
that I adore you.

182
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,915
Quite a turnout, Hardy. Everybody's here.

183
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,391
Yes. A nauseating mixture of Park Avenue
and Broadway. It proves I'm a liberal.

184
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,234
Oh, be honest, Hardy.
You're celebrating your anniversary

185
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,551
and drumming up trade for the art gallery
at the same time.

186
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,111
I never confuse business with sentiment.
Unless it's extremely profitable, of course.

187
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,555
But there is an exhibition tomorrow?

188
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,315
That happens to be a coincidence
I was at great pains to arrange.

189
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,595
Mrs Kingsley, I may have that Turner for you.

190
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:35,630
The landscape?
Oh, Hardy, how wonderful. It thrills me.

191
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,109
- You know what I mean.
- Will you forgive me?

192
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,634
Yes, I do, Mrs Kingsley.

193
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,352
That enjoyment of art is the only remaining
ecstasy that is neither immoral nor illegal.

194
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,958
- Did you receive my Van Gogh?
- Yes. This afternoon.

195
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,393
I... I would've preferred cash,

196
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,359
but if you're short, a painting will have to do.

197
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,592
I imagine I can always dispose of it.

198
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,393
- May I have my letters now, please?
- Certainly.

199
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,598
I'm very proud of you tonight, my dear.

200
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,478
Every man in the room covets you.

201
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,915
I never want you to grow up.

202
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,639
You should remain ageless, like a madonna,

203
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,713
who lives and breathes and smiles,

204
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,199
- and belongs to me.
- That's sweet, Hardy.

205
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,040
Cathcart residence.

206
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,953
Yes, I think he is here.
Might I have your name, please?

207
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,352
<i>- Tell him it's the guy from San Francisco.</i>

208
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,396
Hey. Come here.

209
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,549
- You want a nickel?
- Yes.

210
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,791
Here. Now shut up!

211
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,510
Hello? Hello. Yeah.

212
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,034
Yeah, it worked just like you said.

213
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,680
It took him two nights to spot me.

214
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,673
He took me up to his office.
Pushed some muscle at me.

215
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,228
I played softie.

216
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,356
Yeah, I told him the name.

217
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,357
And when he heard it, brother, he took it hard.

218
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,000
It hit him right where he lived.

219
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,430
Yeah.

220
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,630
Right.

221
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,356
Oh, boy. Music like that
does something to me.

222
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,276
Yeah, they're OK.

223
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,800
You weren't even listening.

224
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,873
What are you thinking about, Brad?

225
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,236
Oh, just that maybe
you won't be around very long.

226
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,233
- I'm thinking about that Tahitian secretary.
- Well, you won't like her.

227
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,914
Maybe not. Those grass skirts rustle.

228
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,595
- I told you before, they're a fire hazard.
- So are you.

229
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,319
<i>Pl-ease, Mr Galt.</i>

230
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,630
- How about it, huh?
- OK.

231
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,595
What is it, Brad?

232
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,599
I got a feeling something's closing in on me -
I don't know what it is.

233
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,114
That's me.

234
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,795
- What happened with that guy last night?
- White Suit?

235
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,156
He milked easy, but it came out pretty thin.

236
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,073
I wouldn't be so jumpy just about you.

237
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,790
Oh, yes, you would.
Cos I'm playing for keeps, remember?

238
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,440
Wanna tell me about it?

239
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,158
No.

240
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,198
If you're sharp, you'll get out now, fast.

241
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,840
I got a feeling I'm living
behind the eight ball.

242
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,754
Something's gonna happen. When it does
you'll end up in the corner pocket,

243
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,876
with a lot of grief.

244
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,150
Get out now, Kathleen.

245
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,238
You're a poor salesman, Brad.

246
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,633
I'll be back in a minute.

247
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,598
You'll be smart if you're not here.

248
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,433
- Hello, Reeves.
- Hi, Galt.

249
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,036
- I was gonna look you up in the morning.
- Fine. What have you done?

250
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,795
- Nothing. Just wanted to talk.
- Go ahead.

251
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:41,108
There's a shyster lawyer in this town with a
swank office, a secretary and no law practice.

252
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,953
This shyster's name is Jardine.

253
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,155
He's put a tail on me.

254
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,993
I think he wants to finish where he left off.

255
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,516
You'd think after San Francisco
he'd leave you alone.

256
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,910
He will. This is just for the record.

257
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,873
- Don't play it too close.
- I'm still working by the book.

258
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,316
Jardine is definitely not the bookish type.

259
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,436
Yeah.

260
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,556
I know.

261
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,435
I decided to wait.

262
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,637
I don't want you to be
in that corner pocket all alone.

263
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,793
In addition, I might add,
you've aroused the maternal instinct in me.

264
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,553
I want to look out for you.

265
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,589
- You hate him an awful lot, don't you?
- Who?

266
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,671
The man who hired White Suit.

267
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,069
He makes it easy.

268
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,113
Brad, what has he got on you?

269
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,671
Nothing. Nobody has,
and nobody's going to.

270
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,354
Not you either.

271
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,958
All right, but remember I can get
brand-new tough guys for a dime a dozen.

272
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,156
Here.

273
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,073
Get yourself two dozen.

274
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,549
I'd rather pick you up at a rummage sale.

275
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,154
I'm a sucker for bargains.

276
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,152
Speaking of which,
if you can't get nines in those nylons,

277
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,028
I'll take eight and a half or even ten.
Doesn't matter.

278
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,429
I'll make a note of it.

279
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,273
Come on, let's finish the dance.

280
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,590
- Thanks, Brad. Good night.
- "Good night"?

281
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,716
Can't I come up for a minute?

282
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,189
I'm thirsty. I want a drink of water.

283
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,034
There you go again,
pitching low and outside.

284
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,111
OK.

285
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,151
You all right, buddy?

286
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,435
- Brad, are you all right?
- Yeah.

287
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,035
- Did he hit you?
- No, I scraped it on the hydrant.

288
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:04,719
You'd better take it easy for a minute. Let's
go in Mrs Schwartz's for a cup of coffee, huh?

289
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,319
Come in. Sit down.

290
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,718
- Can I do something for you?
- Some hot coffee.

291
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,236
Yes, surely. A nice cup of coffee.

292
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,470
Brad, was that an accident?

293
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,994
I don't know. The jury's still out.

294
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,516
Hey, mister. I saw that car.
I got part of the number too.

295
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,876
- What was it?
- I only got the first part. 6-3-N-9 something.

296
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,838
- 6-3-N-9.
- Yes.

297
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,277
- Is that all you got? What kind of a car?
- I couldn't see very well. I think a Lincoln.

298
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,477
- Here, kid.
- Gee, thanks, mister.

299
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,790
Do you think you can trace that number?

300
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,793
I know a cop I can call.
He can check on it, call me back.

301
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,110
What do you think you're gonna prove, Brad?

302
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,715
Maybe nothing.
But I know a guy who's handy with a car.

303
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,917
They tell me you have to be in San Francisco.

304
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,389
You know, on account of the steep hills.

305
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,389
- There a phone in here?
- Back on the wall.

306
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,953
Oh, it's getting late.
I've got to go to Scarsdale.

307
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,508
Scarsdale? At this time of night?

308
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,830
Unfortunately.

309
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,673
Such is the hectic life of an art collector.

310
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,991
For six months I've been trying
to get a Turner landscape.

311
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,914
Tonight of all nights,
the owner is in the mood to talk business.

312
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,838
Confidentially,
I've got to close the deal tonight.

313
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,911
I've already sold it to Mrs Kingsley.

314
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,230
Then you can't afford to haggle over price.

315
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,359
Lovers of beauty
never haggle over price, Tony.

316
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,038
I probably shan't return much before dawn.

317
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,315
How I detest the dawn.

318
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,437
The grass always looks
like it's been left out all night.

319
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,115
- Can I drop you anywhere?
- No, thanks, I have my car. Good night.

320
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,758
Good night, Hardy.

321
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,950
- Scarsdale.
- Yes, sir.

322
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,916
How long will it take to trace that number?

323
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,278
He's working on it.
He'll call me back in a minute.

324
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,558
- Stop looking at me like that, will you?
- Like what?

325
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,438
As if I belong in a test tube.

326
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,508
Look, a guy named Jardine's afraid of me.

327
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,229
He put a tail on me the other night.
I think he tried to kill me tonight.

328
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,869
He'll go on trying. Now are you satisfied?

329
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,198
No. I wanna know why.

330
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,229
I had a private agency in San Francisco.

331
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,788
This guy Jardine was my partner.

332
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,473
He was a... barrister.

333
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,030
Swift cookie with the women.
They came in coveys.

334
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,795
He worked his charm,
and he worked a little blackmail on the side.

335
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,476
I didn't wise up until I caught him stashing
away dough that belonged to the firm.

336
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,916
I called him on it. He promised to cough up.

337
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,716
We drove out to his place in Burlingame
to get to his private safe.

338
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,837
Along the road he slugged me,
wet me down with Scotch,

339
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,912
set me behind the wheel for a takeoff.

340
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,517
I hit a truck, killed the driver.

341
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,276
Manslaughter.

342
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,989
Two years, less time off for good behaviour.

343
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,309
Jardine had a fixed alibi.

344
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,790
It wouldn't break and it wouldn't bend.

345
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,113
That's the last I heard of him,
until White Suit showed up last night.

346
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,350
Now you know why.

347
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,232
All except why you wouldn't tell me before.

348
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,753
A guy likes to hold his head up...

349
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,956
not look like a chump.

350
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,635
That's not the real reason. Come on, say it.

351
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,229
You're not so tough, Brad.
You just think you are.

352
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,790
I've cracked you wide open and you know it.

353
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,115
Hello?

354
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,758
Yeah.

355
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,070
What's the address?

356
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,079
Right. Yeah. Thanks.

357
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,510
Oh, Tony.

358
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,591
<i>Darling.</i>

359
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,118
- You're taking quite a chance, aren't you?
- He won't be back for hours.

360
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,839
Anyway, I'm at the point
where I don't care any more.

361
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,911
I'm glad, darling.

362
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,718
- I'll get you a drink, hm?
- Please.

363
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,909
It's so strange, Tony.

364
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,471
He loves me, gives me everything
a man can give a woman.

365
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,989
But still it isn't enough. It isn't enough, Tony.

366
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,310
I know, dear. I know.

367
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,271
Here you are.

368
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,589
Why, you're upset, darling.

369
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,831
Why don't you drink that down?

370
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,670
Cigarette?

371
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,156
Tony, I tried.

372
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,357
I made a bad bargain
and I tried to stick it out with him.

373
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,912
But I just keep sitting
listening to his paintings crack with age.

374
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,753
I want you to take me
away with you, Tony. Please.

375
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,680
Look, Mari. Hardy can afford you,
but he doesn't make you happy.

376
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,911
I love you, but I have no money.

377
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,272
Tony, darling. What does that matter?

378
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,715
I have already borrowed money from you.

379
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,634
Do you think I want to go through life
being taken care of like a pet poodle?

380
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,840
Darling, we have my jewels. They're yours.
You're taking them for me, for my sake.

381
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,994
- Darling, I wanted you to say that, but I...
- No more buts.

382
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,709
Just tell me when we can go.
It must be soon.

383
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,276
Perhaps tomorrow.

384
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,193
I have some business
I have to take care of first.

385
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,350
I'll let you know.

386
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,870
- Hi, Tony.
- Hello, Brad.

387
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,518
Still catering to the female trade.

388
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,631
Take it easy, Tony.

389
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,909
What do you want here?

390
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,952
I'm just delivering a message
from me to you.

391
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,191
Lay off. Keep that tail off me.

392
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,158
- Stop playing me for a clay pigeon.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

393
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,598
I'll explain in simple terms.
Like a two-year term for manslaughter.

394
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,674
I kept remembering that pretty face of yours,
Jardine, all the time I was in hock.

395
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,991
If you're not sharp,
you're not gonna have that pretty face.

396
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,071
You're not gonna have any face at all.

397
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,550
I haven't hired a tail.
And I haven't been after you.

398
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,030
I didn't even know you were out.
And that's on the level.

399
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:07,591
You on the level? Why, for six bits
you'd hang your mother on a meat hook.

400
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,754
Hello, operator? I want the police. Hurry.

401
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,795
That's nice lipstick, baby -

402
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,871
whoever you are.

403
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,952
But you're wasting it on the wrong guy.

404
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,039
- Darling, who was it?
- No one you know.

405
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,588
- I phoned the police.
- You what?

406
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,035
The police. They'll be here in a minute.

407
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:42,468
Don't you realise they'll find you here? Come
on. Go out the back way. Through the kitchen.

408
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,918
- What's going on around here?
- Nothing, officer. What can I do for you?

409
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,393
- We got a call at the station.
- Why, that's absurd. I was alone. Reading.

410
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,229
A woman phoned in.

411
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,519
You read pretty rugged stuff.

412
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,910
- Who's the guy? Her husband?
- No.

413
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,675
Look, forget about the dame. Who's the guy?

414
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:39,198
Look, we got a report to make. If you don't
talk here, we'll have to take you downtown.

415
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,831
- Officer, can't we discuss this...?
- What's his name?

416
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,595
His name is Galt.

417
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,875
Bradford Galt.

418
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,236
"Galt, Bradford."

419
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,835
"Fight. Apartment 204."

420
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,196
- You forgot your hat.
- Thanks.

421
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,635
- Are you all right?
- Perfect.

422
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,636
Your coat's torn.

423
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,558
You oughta see the other guy.

424
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,393
- May I come up?
- Sure.

425
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,989
Well? What happened?

426
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,596
We talked.

427
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,116
One thing led to another,
and he led with his right.

428
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,749
- After that he stopped talking.
- Mm-hm.

429
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,990
Where did that get you?

430
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,675
Nowhere. But I feel a lot better.

431
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,030
Come on over here where you belong.

432
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,714
Oh. No, thank you.

433
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,920
If you're feeling that much better,
I think I'd better go home now.

434
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,956
What about that maternal instinct?

435
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,395
That doesn't work after sundown.

436
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,910
You sew a nice seam.
You got any other talents?

437
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,869
I can cook.

438
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,431
Isn't my Turner divine?

439
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,796
Look at it. It grows on you.

440
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,075
You make it sound like a species of fungus.

441
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,869
Oh! Don't run away, Hardy.
You promised to show me that new Raphael.

442
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,953
The one I've been hearing about for years?
I must see it, Hardy.

443
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,395
It arrived this morning. It's in the vault.

444
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,235
- Shall we look at it now?
- Wonderful, Hardy. I'd love to see it.

445
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,470
We're looking at the Raphael. Will you come?

446
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:16,315
- I'd like to. I've never been downstairs.
- Mrs Kingsley?

447
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:29,798
This is the portrait that Italian family
refused to sell, isn't it?

448
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,350
Yes. I saw it a great many years ago
and thought it enchanting.

449
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,477
When I couldn't buy it,
I became obsessed with owning it.

450
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,915
So like you, Hardy.

451
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,198
Merely the passion
of the true collector, my dear.

452
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,998
The rest of the Peruscini family
would've sold long ago,

453
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,719
but the old count refused every offer.

454
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:05,796
I knew I couldn't buy it while he was
still alive, so fortunately, he decided to die.

455
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,831
And I got it.

456
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,231
<i>Oh.</i>

457
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,200
Why... Why, it's Mari.

458
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,390
The resemblance isn't pure accident.

459
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,110
<i>- You mean it was retouched?
- Certainly not.</i>

460
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,998
I found the portrait long before I met Mari,

461
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,071
and I worshipped it.

462
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,392
When I did meet her
it was as if I'd always known her.

463
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,071
And wanted her.

464
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,355
Oh, how romantic.

465
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,754
- If you prefer to be maudlin about it, perhaps.
- Hardy hates sentiment.

466
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,308
The light is atrocious,
why not take it upstairs?

467
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,712
I want to have it revarnished.
I also want to get another frame for it.

468
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,911
- Shall we go?
- Oh, I wish we could've taken it upstairs.

469
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,590
Tony.

470
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:29,549
<i>- Can we leave tonight? Can we?
- Yes, darling.</i>

471
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,438
We're expected at Mrs Kingsley's.

472
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,990
I can make some excuse,
meet you at your apartment.

473
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,116
All right.

474
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,829
- Have MacDonald close the vault.
- Yes.

475
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,591
No one saw you come in?

476
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,958
I came through the side door,
as per instructions.

477
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,679
Also, I never saw you in my life before.

478
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,797
Good. Now, tell me what happened.

479
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,429
- It didn't work. It was a busto-crusto.
- A what?

480
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:26,195
- A flop.
- Oh. Well, go on.

481
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:31,559
Galt went over to Jardine's place last night
and pushed him around some, but that's all.

482
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,791
Somebody called the cops, but Galt got out.

483
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:40,512
- What time did this happen?
- About one o'clock. I was out front.

484
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,750
Look, if you want my opinion,
I think you're wasting your time.

485
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,038
This guy Galt is a smart cookie. He ain't
gonna let himself get shoved into a noose.

486
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,954
And if you can't needle him into
knocking off Jardine, why not let me do it?

487
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,669
I can put a slug into him the nice clean way.

488
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,596
- Get him on the phone.
- Who?

489
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,318
- Galt.
- Oh.

490
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,789
And stop flicking your ashes on my rug.

491
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,553
That's a genuine Kashan.

492
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,629
Hello? Yes.

493
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,235
<i>- Just a moment, please.</i>

494
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,153
And no sooner did he get back
than he left her again.

495
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,391
And I want him back. He needs me.

496
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,994
My job was done when I found your husband.

497
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,913
- It's yourjob to keep him.
- I know that...

498
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,992
The man in the white suit is on the phone.

499
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,032
- Yeah?
- Hello, Galt? You got any dough?

500
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,680
Maybe. What are you selling?

501
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,320
I'm selling Jardine short.

502
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,312
He's slow pay, and I like to keep moving.

503
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:00,115
<i>- You wanna know what he's up to?
- You need $200 to leave town.</i>

504
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,192
I need two yards, powder money.

505
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,272
<i>- Where? Your office?
- No, no, no.</i>

506
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:11,878
- No. No, the heat's on.
- Come to my place. 504 West 52nd.

507
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:16,152
<i>Apartment 307. 7:30.</i>

508
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,356
<i>- Tonight?
- Yes.</i>

509
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,431
Right.

510
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,715
OK. I'll tip you if I can't make it.

511
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,671
All right.

512
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,914
Well, that's done.

513
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,912
Yeah, but how you gonna get Jardine to bite?

514
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,916
After last night he ain't gonna pay no social
call on Galt to get pushed around some more.

515
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,230
He'll be there.

516
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,470
Why shouldn't he be?

517
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,950
After all, he's one of my closest friends.

518
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,428
I trusted him,

519
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,193
now he'll trust me.

520
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,836
How can I watch a newsreel while...

521
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,992
Look, honey. The show takes an hour.
It's seven o'clock.

522
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,469
- I'll be back at eight.
- But I wanna go with you.

523
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,028
White Suit won't talk while anyone's around.

524
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,190
One, please.

525
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,078
Never thought I'd have to beg
to go to your apartment.

526
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,711
You've been there. I'll let you know when
I need any more sewing done. Or cooking.

527
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,394
That's one of your talents too, isn't it?

528
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:38,390
<i>(radio) If your number is selected and for
some reason you don't wish to compete...</i>

529
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:44,720
<i>Number 836. There he is,
let's give him a hand.</i>

530
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,033
Oof.

531
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,875
<i>Brad? Brad.</i>

532
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,998
Brad!

533
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,750
Brad?

534
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,470
Brad.

535
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,555
Go away.

536
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,632
Why didn't you come back for me?
What's the matter?

537
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,631
Nothing.

538
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,554
<i>- I-I'll see you later at your place.
- Let me in.</i>

539
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,476
Brad, I'm gonna stay right here
until you open this door.

540
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,073
<i>What's the matter?</i>

541
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,120
Meet Tony Jardine.

542
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,516
Brad...

543
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,795
Don't crowd me. I haven't got the answers.

544
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:32,112
But the police'll find 'em. They're like
road markers running right up my alley.

545
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,839
- Brad, they can't.
- Oh, I'll make book on it.

546
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:38,071
- You've got to call the police.
- What am I gonna tell 'em?

547
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,993
That somebody put me out
with a faceful of ether?

548
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,992
I woke up and there was Jardine
with his brains beaten out?

549
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:48,710
And me with a poker in my hand? They'll still
be laughing while they strap me in the chair.

550
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,268
You can't handle anything like this alone.

551
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,909
Don't give me that law and justice routine.
The cops operate on facts.

552
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,719
And the facts are phoney,
from here to the death cell.

553
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,756
Now get out and let me dope this out.

554
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,434
I didn't mean that.
I just meant I wanted to help.

555
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:06,718
Yeah, thanks. Thanks, but you can't.
Now beat it, will you?

556
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,633
I've gotta stall for time
and figure this out.

557
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,950
Now get outta here.

558
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,352
I... uh... put the poker away.

559
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:09,870
- I want to help you, Brad.
- I can't let you. If I miss, you'll be in it too.

560
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,350
<i>If we miss. I don't care, Brad.</i>

561
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,159
Whatever's done to you is done to me,

562
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,391
and I'm hanging onto you, nylons and all.

563
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,471
Brad, listen. This may sound silly,

564
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:48,190
but I think that man in the white suit
wanted you to spot him that very first night.

565
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:52,910
Course he did. No guy in his right mind
wears a white suit on a shag job.

566
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,958
<i>Why'd that car almost hit me?</i>

567
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:59,874
Jardine wasn't out to get me -
I should've known that from the start -

568
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,030
but somebody sure is.

569
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,953
Somebody who knew
about Jardine and me in San Francisco.

570
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,918
Somebody who wanted me
to think Jardine was after me.

571
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,230
But who, Brad, who?

572
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,959
I don't know. There isn't a thing to latch onto.

573
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,510
Maybe it's something you've forgotten.

574
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,591
No, I'm clean as a peeled egg.

575
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:22,798
No debts, no angry husbands,
no payoffs, nothing.

576
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,111
People don't go around
committing murder and frame-ups for fun.

577
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,749
So it doesn't add. What do you
want me to do, call the Quiz Kids?

578
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,912
- It doesn't make sense, but...
- What?

579
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,998
Maybe if I could find White Suit
I could get a lead.

580
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,675
- Where's that wallet?
- At my apartment.

581
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,796
Come on, let's go.

582
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,634
- What about him?
- They only clean up once a week.

583
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:57,475
The maid never cleans under the bed.
That'll give me a head start.

584
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,911
Go ask the janitor where I am. Say you
rang my bell and I don't seem to be home.

585
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,516
- Go to your apartment, I'll meet you there.
- All right.

586
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,789
<i>- Who is it?
- Me.</i>

587
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,229
- There's a drink in that cabinet.
- Thanks.

588
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,990
Here it is.

589
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,748
Fred Foss, 328 East 23rd Street.

590
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:58,515
- I think we're gonna hit pay dirt.
- How do you know it's White Suit?

591
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,593
My thumb, baby. My thumb tells me.
Come on, let's go.

592
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:16,677
- Fred Foss live here?
- Ground floor, round the back, on that side.

593
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,751
Thanks.

594
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,755
<i>Oh, mamma mia!</i>

595
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,831
Where's Fred Foss?

596
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,708
What do you want with me?
I didn't do anything.

597
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:16,357
- Is this your wallet?
- Sure, that's my pocketbook.

598
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,829
I lost it in the subway.

599
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:22,037
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're Fred Foss?

600
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:25,715
Sure I'm Fred Foss. Ask the neighbours.

601
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,234
- My five dollars, it ain't here.
- OK, OK.

602
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:31,517
- Five dollars.
- I don't want your five dollars.

603
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,636
Thank you. Thank you.

604
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,069
There goes my last lead.

605
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,999
I feel all dead inside.

606
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,913
I'm backed up in a dark corner

607
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,719
and I don't know who's hitting me.

608
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,916
Yes?

609
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,997
Very good.

610
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:27,437
Get in touch with me tomorrow.
Same place, same time.

611
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,079
- Who's there?
- It's I, darling.

612
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,310
Just a minute.

613
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,916
Come in.

614
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:30,478
It's after nine, darling.
We're expected at Mrs Kingsley's at ten.

615
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:34,314
Oh, I simply can't go, Hardy.
I've got a miserable headache.

616
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,709
All right.

617
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,189
I'm so sorry, my dear.

618
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:48,268
I'm going right to bed.
Why don't you run along without me?

619
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:51,033
I wouldn't think of it, darling.

620
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,469
Mrs Kingsley will be so upset.

621
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,034
She doesn't upset that easily.

622
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,395
But I did promise to meet Tony there.

623
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:10,599
I had rather a delicate matter
to discuss with him.

624
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,960
Hadn't you better go, then?

625
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,520
I imagine it can wait.

626
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,800
I'd rather stay here with you.

627
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,189
Isn't it important?

628
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:39,070
No. But it's a problem
he's eminently qualified to handle,

629
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:44,280
a man of his vast experience with the law,
in all its tawdry aspects.

630
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,917
You sound so mysterious.
What's it all about?

631
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,073
The oldest clich in the world.

632
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:58,473
One of my friends, who deluded himself
that his was the ideal marriage,

633
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,677
has recently discovered there's another man.

634
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:08,229
Well, Tony doesn't handle divorces, does he?

635
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:11,312
The husband doesn't want a divorce.

636
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,119
You mean, he wants her back?

637
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,997
Yes.

638
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,674
And as the lost and found ads say...

639
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,910
he offers a suitable reward for her return.

640
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:27,554
You mean the other man
would take money and just go away?

641
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:31,240
When an impoverished character,

642
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:34,118
unendowed with any appreciable virtues,

643
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,873
succumbs to a rich man's wife,

644
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:44,629
it has to be suspected that his interest
is less passionate than pecuniary.

645
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,438
But how could she be taken in
by such a man?

646
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,671
Take... Tony, for instance.

647
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:58,119
I'd never imagine him
to be interested in... Lucy Wilding.

648
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:03,068
- But he is.
- It's not true! He's always loathed her.

649
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:06,277
He loathed her rather intimately, I'm afraid.

650
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:10,114
But he couldn't. I mean, she's too old for him.

651
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:30,237
Love is not the exclusive province
of adolescents, my dear.

652
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:33,710
It's a heart ailment that strikes all age groups.

653
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,109
Like my love for you.

654
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,749
My love for you
is the only malady I've contracted

655
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,912
since the usual childhood diseases.

656
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:51,395
And... it's incurable.

657
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,555
- Who is it?
- The milkman, Miss Stuart. 85 cents, please.

658
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,790
- Morning.
- Morning.

659
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,036
Oh, thank you.

660
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,793
Nothing.

661
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,399
Maybe I ought to hire a press agent.

662
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,311
- What time is it?
- Seven.

663
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,159
If I only knew who was after me,
it wouldn't be so bad.

664
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:21,198
How do you fight
if you don't know who you're fighting?

665
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:24,352
- You're licked before you start.
- I know you.

666
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:28,194
- You won't let anybody get away with this.
- Oh, don't be too sure.

667
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:30,555
Worked before.

668
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,949
<i>I can be framed easier than Whistler's Mother.</i>

669
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,919
All right. All right.
We'll just sit down and feel sorry for you.

670
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,833
- We'll build a Wailing Wall.
- OK, OK.

671
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:45,276
But don't give me that Pollyanna routine
either, about how everything's gonna be fine.

672
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,079
I'm no miracle man.

673
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:54,235
That maid comes to my apartment and hits
bingo under the bed, I'm as good as cooked.

674
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,470
Here, drink this.

675
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:04,671
Look at me.
Tower of strength, nerves of steel.

676
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:10,515
Don't bother, Brad. The stain'll come out.

677
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,116
Stain.

678
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:22,159
- The ink. I smeared ink on his white suit.
- What of it?

679
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,590
He'd need the suit cleaned.
The cleaners would have his address.

680
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:30,673
This is a dirty town. Cleaning places
grow on every street like mushrooms.

681
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:33,593
They don't do their own cleaning.
Where's the classified?

682
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,910
There.

683
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,878
They farm the stuff out
to the big cleaning and dye plants.

684
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,509
- There can't be too many of them.
- What if he didn't have it cleaned?

685
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:48,072
He wouldn't run around town
in an ink-stained suit. It ain't neat.

686
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,476
That's a pretty long list.

687
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,790
We'll each take half of it.

688
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:02,954
It's early in the season for white suits
so we ought to find it if we have it.

689
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:07,511
There's a five-spot in it for you
if you do. Get moving.

690
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:12,877
We had a couple of white suits,
but none with ink on 'em.

691
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,311
OK.

692
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,550
No white suits. Sorry.

693
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:14,395
These are the contracts
and this is your dental appointment.

694
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,951
Cathcart Galleries.

695
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,110
Yes.

696
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:26,711
- A Mr Smith from San Francisco.
- Oh, yes.

697
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,830
That will be all.

698
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:38,078
Yes? Look here,
there's nothing in the papers, not a word.

699
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:43,280
I told you the deal went through and it did.
Can I help it if they ain't found the shipment?

700
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:47,273
Well, that sounds very odd to me.
You're positive nothing went wrong?

701
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:50,511
What do you want me to do, take out an ad?

702
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:57,593
Listen, Cathcart. We get this deal settled
today or I'm coming down to the galleries.

703
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,877
And right through that front door.

704
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:06,313
I have a three o'clock dental appointment
in the Grant Building. Meet me there.

705
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,391
Wait a minute.

706
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:14,674
Grant Building. 31st floor. Three o'clock.

707
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,916
OK.

708

<i>(police dispatcher) Car 15. Car 15.</i>

709
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,677
- What time is it?
- 1:45.

710
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:44,156
Hello? Yeah?

711
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,391
No. No, not a seersucker. A white linen suit.

712
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,550
Yeah. Thanks.

01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,430
Hi, Galt.

717
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,997
Forgot your boy scout oath, didn't you?

718
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,719
I thought you were gonna lay off Jardine.

719
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:26,920
- I'm clean, Reeves. That's on the level.
- Sure, sure. I believe you.

720
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,594
Anyway, he didn't press charges.

721
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,630
I don't blame you for mussing him up,

722

but breaking in and wrecking his furniture?

723
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:39,952
I'm going to have to take your merit badge
away from you if you don't lay off.

724
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,759

Yes, that's the suit!
What name? What name did he give?

729
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,516
Just a minute.

730
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,637
Yes, I have it. What address?

- What?

735
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:36,395
- Where's Martha?
- She ain't here no more. She quit yesterday.

736
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,199
- Well, good riddance.
- Yes'm.

737
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,275
- Hello.
- Hello.

738
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:10,035
Man named Stauffer live here?
Sort of a heavy-set guy?

739
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:13,192
He left half an hour ago, bags and all.

740
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,748
Where'd he go?

- Cop?
- No.

742
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:22,269
- Please, lady, where'd he go? It's important.
- I know.

743
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:26,797
- You do, honey? Tell me, where'd he go?
- Don't mind her. She don't know nothing.

744
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:31,510
Yes, I do. Yes, I do!
I heard him on the telephone.

745
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,716
Well, tell him then.

746
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:37,031
Honey, would you like a nickel?
Here. Where'd he go?

747
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,634
- He went to a building.
- What building?

748
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:42,553
Same as the president.
The one with the beard.

749
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,871
- Lincoln Building?
- Uh-uh.

750
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:51,439
- Grant Building?
- Uh-huh. He was sick.

751
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:52,873
Was he?

752
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,669
He said he was going to get
his cascara at the gallery.

753
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,156
Can you get cascara at a gallery?

754
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:03,800
I don't know, honey. Here.

755
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:43,400
OK. We're in the clear.

756
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,790
I can't understand
why there hasn't been a word in the papers.

757
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,758
You're positive nothing went wrong?

758
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:57,435
When I do a job, I do a job.
They just ain't found him yet.

759
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:03,470
I came straight here from the bank.
I didn't have a chance to count this. Oh.

760
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:56,031
Don't stop traffic.
Come on, move it out of here. Go ahead.

- Keep back, buddy. Keep back.

764
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:28,470
- Get those cars moving.
- He says to drive to the Grant Building.

765
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,313
He seemed OK,
even asked me to wait for him.

766
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,675
How did I know
he was going to take a brodie?

767
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,274
Brother, he came out of there like a hot rivet.

768
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:39,158
I've still got his bags in my hack.

769
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:47,116
You know, it's a funny thing.
I never yet seen one of those guys bounce.

770
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,718
Hey, you! Come back here!
Hey, he's stealing my cab!

771
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,229
There goes the ball game.
Not a card, not a letter, nothing.

772
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:27,709
I played tag with a.38 to get this stuff,

773
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,837
and this trail stops cold
on the 5th Avenue sidewalk.

774
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:34,071
- He'll never even be identified.
- You'll get a break.

775
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:37,869
The cleaner found the suit.
He gave me Stauffer's name and address.

776
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,996
The girl told me the Grant Building.

777
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:44,119
What more break can I ask for?
I may be stupid, but I know when I'm licked.

778
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:47,351
- Well, I'm not licked.
- Nobody asked you to be.

779
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,670
OK. So I'll fry. I can't help that.

780
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:54,834
Yes, you can. Use your head. Think hard.
For instance, what else did that kid tell you?

781
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:58,230
- Nothing. Nothing that made sense.
- Well, what was it?

782
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:03,235
Something about Stauffer had to get
his cascara at the gallery. OK, figure that one.

783
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,796
Cascara at the galleries. Cascara.

784
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:15,190
You don't even get cascara at the galleries.

785
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:21,558
Maybe he was sick and he went
to see a doctor at the Grant Building.

786
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:24,713
Brad.

787
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:29,032
There's an art gallery. I've seen
their ad in the paper. It's on 5th Avenue.

788
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:36,995
There it is. Cathcart Galleries.

789
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:42,393
Cathcart Galleries. Cathcart Galleries. What
would Stauffer have to do with an art gallery?

790
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:45,870
That's the point. He wouldn't
unless there was some connection.

791
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:49,953
You got something there.
Up in Jardine's apartment...

792
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:53,077
I remember now...
there was a painting, just unwrapped.

793
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:03,676
Reeves. Get this stuff out of the way, quick.
I'll go down the back way. You stay put.

794
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,035
- Meet you at your place.
- Where will you be?

795
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:09,351
Absorbing culture at the gallery.
I don't wanna die ignorant.

796
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:39,151
- Where's Galt?
- He isn't here. What do want me to tell him?

797
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:44,155
You can tell him goodbye.
He's going to the chair for murder.

798
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:19,158
- May I help you?
- Yeah. I want to look around.

799
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:23,631
Well, it's almost closing time,
but if I can be of any help to you...

800
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:29,358
Yes, you can. You can take the tour with me,
tell me about the paintings.

801
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:33,911
- And I'd like to ask you some questions.
- I'm at your service.

802
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:37,388
Oh, has Mr Pagacelli been in today?

803
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:40,950
- The great Dutch critic.
- I don't believe I know him.

804
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,395
He's a big beefy guy with a broken nose.

805
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:46,438
He wears a white suit,
even though it's early in the season.

806
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:51,355
- Are you sure you haven't seen him here?
- Why, no. I'm sure I haven't.

807
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:54,910
Maybe you'd care for something like this.

808
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,437
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

809
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:03,548
I don't think so.
She looks like she's been stuffed with kapok.

810
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,431
Come in.

811
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:26,511
Shall I close the vault, Mr Cathcart?

812
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,273
- Everybody's gone?
- One customer with Miss Dennis.

813
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:32,636
You may go. I'll lock the vault.
There's something to put away.

814
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,598
- Good night, Mr Cathcart.
- Good night.

815
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:57,875
This is one of Donatello's finest pieces.

816
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,509
- How much is it?
- $40,000.

817
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,989
- Wrap it up.
- You mean you'll take it?

818
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:17,834
- How much for the pedestal?
- It's just one of our ordinary pedestals.

819
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:20,036
I know, but I've got to have it.

820
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:22,793
- By the way, who owns this place?
- Hardy Cathcart.

821
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,950
- Is he in?
- I believe so.

822
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:30,034
I realise a small sale doesn't entitle me to any
unusual consideration, but I'd like to see him.

823
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:33,908
Why, certainly. Would you follow me, please?

824
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:43,595
I'm sorry. Mr Cathcart must be in the vault.

825
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:46,114
- Just make yourself comfortable.
- I will.

826
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:50,830
- I'll tell him you're here. He'll be right up.
- No hurry.

827
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:07,279
Mr Cathcart, a gentleman in your office
wishes to purchase the Donatello.

828
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:11,148
- He wants the pedestal too.
- That can be arranged.

829
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:14,198
He wants to take it with him.
He asked me to "wrap it up".

830
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:18,034
- "Wrap it up"? The Donatello?
- Yes, sir.

831
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:21,556
I'll attend to it myself.
You may go now, Miss Dennis.

832
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,517
- Good night.
- Good night.

833
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,309
- Mr Cathcart will only be a minute.
- Thanks.

834
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:41,358
- Would you care for a glass of sherry?
- No, never touch it.

835
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,398
- Well, then. Good night.
- Good night.

836
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,552
Hardy, I...

837
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:09,234
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought my husband was here.

838
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:13,512
- Mrs Cathcart?
- Yes?

839
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:16,160
Your husband's in the vault.
He'll be up in a minute.

840
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:18,800
Thank you.

841
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:56,591
I believe we have
a mutual acquaintance, Mrs Cathcart.

842
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:58,875
- Yes?
- Anthony Jardine.

843
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,470
He's a very good friend of my husband's.

844
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:07,269
- Have you seen him lately?
- Oh, not for several days.

845
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:11,793
I'm afraid you won't be seeing him
for a long, long time.

846
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:14,553
- He's been murdered.
- Murdered?

847
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,033
Oh, no!

848
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:22,839
That's what I came
to see your husband about.

849
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:25,150
Hardy?

850
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:27,800
Hardy did it.

851
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:52,914
How dare you touch her.
Keep your hands off her.

852
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,195
Cathcart, huh?

853
01:30:55,280 --> 01:31:01,389
It's good to see you out in the open at last.
It cuts you down to size. Way down.

854
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:03,755
Strange, Mr Galt.

855
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:07,515
Seeing you here
causes me to revise my opinion of you.

856
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,550
It's gone up.

857
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:20,192
Now... shall we go?

858
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:23,397
- I prefer privacy.
- What for?

859
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,635
For our little chat.

860
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,950
Downstairs.

861
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:58,711
You came to see me, Mr Galt.
About the Donatello, wasn't it?

862
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,953
Actually, I'm interested
in a piece of modern art.

863
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:04,679
Something stiff as a statue by now.

864
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:07,433
It was finished the night before last.

865
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:11,195
I think it belongs in your collection.
A Tony Jardine.

866
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:16,513
Nonsense. I never handle anything
as worthless as a Jardine.

867
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:19,068
No. You mishandled it.

868
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:23,472
Did I? When it was found in your apartment?

869
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:26,074
Perhaps it was delivered
to the wrong collector.

870
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:28,515
- Sure you can't claim it?
- Positive.

871
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:31,319
Actually, this Jardine really belongs to you.

872
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:34,073
- You paid to have it done.
- Did I, Mr Galt?

873
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:38,756
Somebody had to pay that muscle artist
to brush him off. Or didn't you ever pay him?

874
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:42,230
Perhaps you launched him out the window
to get what was coming to him.

875
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:46,552
Mr Galt, your imagination
is beginning to bore me.

876
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:52,273
- Step in there.
- Listen to me. You can't get away with this...

877
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:54,157
Can't I?

878
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:56,959
You're a criminal. I apprehended you.

879
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:00,953
Your wife knows you bumped off
her boyfriend. You think she'll keep quiet?

880
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:04,316
What my wife does is no concern of yours.
Leave her out of it.

881
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:08,632
Jardine's corpse was found
in your apartment, and that ends it.

882
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:12,759
Oh, no, it doesn't. Not by a long shot.
You pinned the evidence on me,

883
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:17,072
but when the police finish digging,
they'll find out you had a better motive.

884
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:20,596
That's the only sensible thing
you've said so far.

885
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:24,798
I dare say, at a trial, our respective motives
will make an interesting case.

886
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:30,159
Who knows, it might even have the
distinction of reaching the highest court.

887
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:32,390
But unfortunately, Mr Galt,

888
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:36,029
you won't be around to hear the decision.

889
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:38,350
Now, get in there.

890
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,516
Hey, Mac.

891
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:14,798
Do you suppose anybody in his right mind
ever buys a piece ofjunk like that?

892
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:18,111
Sure they do. That is art.

893
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,996
Thanks, Reeves.

894
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:26,110
Good night, Reeves.

895
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,318
Good night. I'll see you
first thing in the morning.

896
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:36,191
Would you make that later in the day? We
have a date in the morning. At the city hall.

897
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:40,273
He hasn't asked me yet, but I told him
from the beginning I was playing for keeps.

898
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:42,999
Looks like it'll have to be
tomorrow afternoon.

899
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:47,312
- OK. I'll see you then. And congratulations.
- Thanks.

900
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,470
- Good night.
- Good night.

901
