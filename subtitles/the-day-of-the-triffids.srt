St Merryn's Hospital, Wednesday May 12th.

7
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,950
Or is it still Tuesday May 11th?

8
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,710
No...

9
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,550
It must be Wednesday because most of the time
the noise of the traffic is so loud

10
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,150
that you need earplugs to hear yourself think.

It must be Wednesday because most of the time
the noise of the traffic is so loud

12
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,870
that means it must be the silent early hours.

13
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,990
Three, four, who knows?

14
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,790
But I'm already awake.

15
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,830
What's more, I'm hungry. Isn't it ridiculous?

16
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,590
The nurses come in at seven, on the dot.

17
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,160
With a lovely cup of tea.

18
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,230
Then the wash, then the breakfast.

19
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,100
And then today - great day...

Eureka.

21
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,510
These bandages come off.

So...

25
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,230
I'm taking the opportunity of this waiting time

26
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,990
to reply to your cassette.

27
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,350
Dear Walter, many thanks for your cassette.

28
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,630
There we are.

29
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,910
I've been doing a lot of thinking
while I've been lying here, Wal.

30
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,710
And I've come to a decision.

31
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,740
I've had enough. I'm chucking the job.
I'm fed up with triffids.

32
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,110
I wanna be loved.

33
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,030
I wanna breed puppies and plant potatoes.

34
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,750
So, as you are gonna write your book about triffs,

35
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,790
and on condition that
I never have to mention them again,

36
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,420
I'll use this waiting time.

37
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,950
It's not that I'm worried about this morning.

38
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,420
It's just that I'm scared stiff!

39
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,790
I'll use this time to do as you ask

40
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,790
and give you some of my theories
about the early days.

41
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,950
Some of it's more than theories, too.

42
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,950
<i>The stories about Palanguez
I got from a good source.</i>

43
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,110
<i>In 1961 he turned up
at the office of European Oils.</i>

44
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,190
<i>We've had it analysed, Mr Palanguez.
Experts confirm it is a vegetable oil.</i>

45
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,630
- But with extraordinary properties.
- I've never seen anything like it.

46
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,830
You'll see a great deal of it, Mr Grant.

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,870
It will come on the market in seven or eight years.

48
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,870
<i>- Possibly.
- As an additive to petroleum?</i>

49
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,030
- Yes.
- With an energy saving of over 30%?

50
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,590
<i>Do you intend to market it yourself,
Mr Palanguez?</i>

51
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,300
Would I be showing it to you if I did?

52
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,710
I suppose you have a proposition.
Shall we come to it?

53
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,430
The plant from which this oil is obtained
is a completely new species.

54
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,270
I might be able to provide the seeds of this plant.

55
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,350
If you commence cultivation at once,

56
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,150
you could begin production of the oil in five years,
or it might be six for full yield.

57
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,270
You would still be in advance of your competitors.

58
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,630
Or I could always come to an arrangement
with the competitors.

59
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,550
I think you will find they are not
approachable - or suppressible.

60
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,110
You mean they're behind the Iron Curtain?

61
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,950
Seeds, you said.

62
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,390
Have you heard of a Russian professor
of biology called Lysenko?

63
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,470
There are rumours he's made
some strange experiments.

64
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,940
I have heard these rumours.

65
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,740
What figure did you have in mind
for getting us the seeds?

66
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,430
Ten million pounds.

(GRANT LAUGHS)

68
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,190
And a percentage of the profits.
It is a very dangerous business, Mr Grant.

69
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,550
There are many people I must pay.

70
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,550
For you, the choice is between ruin
or a monopoly in the Western world.

71
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,180
I will not lower my price.

72
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,790
<i>And he didn't lower it.
And they paid him - or part of it -</i>

73
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,350
<i>because Mr Palanguez was never seen again.</i>

74
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,510
Of course, in the end,
the company got those seeds.

75
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,510
But by the time they did,
they weren't the only ones. What they...

Meanwhile, back to the triffids.

I still lived at home with Mum and Dad.</i>

85
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,310
<i>It was a year or so after Palanguez disappeared,
not that I'd ever heard of him then.</i>

86
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,910
<i>But we know from a Russian
that the seeds had been taken away.</i>

87
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,710
<i>I always thought that Russian fighters
got on his tail and shot him up.</i>

88
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:38,590
<i>Those seeds are like vapour.
If they got out, they'd drift almost anywhere.</i>

89
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,830
- Funny, isn't it, Dad?
- Yes, it is a little curious.

90
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,510
Rather curious.

91
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,300
- Any idea of what it is?
- No, not really.

92
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,230
It's blown in from somewhere.

93
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,030
Either that or a foreign import
of some sort I know not what of.

94
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,270
Or else some new strain
that someone's been rearing.

95
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,350
What are these stumps at the bottom?

96
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,060
Search me. Very peculiar.

97
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,830
Here...

98
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,990
Come on, Bill. Have a look inside. Come on.

99
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,670
- Ugh!
- Come on, Bill, that's nature.

100
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,630
I've grown rather fond of it, myself.

101

I shall take care of you, old chap.

102

<i>Our plant was too young

<i>They couldn't only walk. They could kill.</i>

119
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,190
<i>Triffids began to appear all over the world.</i>

120
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,350
<i>Something else about them sickened everyone.</i>

121
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,230
<i>Triffids were also carnivores.</i>

122
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,100
<i>They stung their victims,
then waited for the flesh to decompose.</i>

123
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,270
<i>Not until then could they use it for food.</i>

<i>Triffids were hacked down by the thousand.</i>

<i>The new plant was
very nearly eliminated from earth.</i>

<i>Very nearly. But not quite.</i>

127
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,910
Because scientists realised the nasty triffid

128
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,780
was the same plant from Russia
that produced the wonderful oil.

- Triffids were...

That meant that triffids were very lovely
and very big business.

131
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,630
As I had a bond with them, I went to work on
a triffid farm and so did you. You know the rest.

You get like a kid when you're as helpless as this.

There must be some emergency on.

139
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,470
There's no point in me getting into a paddy.
There's nothing I could...

140
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,830
That's funny. Where's all the traffic got to?

The worst thing about living in this blackness

is that there's no certainty
of knowing anything at all.

Apart from the fact I've gone bananas.

148
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,390
It reminds me of that conversation

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,190
I'm going home.

155
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,550
- Time for walkies.
- Don't you start.

156
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,950
- What?
- Kiddy talk about triffs.

157
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,110
Who have you been falling out with?

158
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,470
Jack Richards has planted a triffid in his garden

159
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,350
so his daughter can have it for a pet.

160
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,710
He wouldn't be the first.

161
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,550
<i>Perfectly safe if he keeps it on some sort of chain
and cuts the sting out every two years.</i>

162
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,590
- Quite fun for a kid in lots of ways.
- Fun?!

163
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,750
- Have a nightcap?
- Yeah. Ta.

<i>(TAPPING)</i>

We know very little about them, you know.

166
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,630
For example, what do you think that is,

167
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,710
when they rattle their sticks against their stem?

168
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,710
I thought we decided
it was a sort of primitive mating call.

169
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,390
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

170
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,790
I think they're talking.

171
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,710
Talking?!

172
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,790
I've been thinking that for some time.
Now I'm prepared to say so.

173
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,230
Well, to you, anyway.

174
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,430
Walter, a talking plant is ridiculous!

175
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,060
So is a walking plant, but a triffid walks.

176
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,550
- Well, it moves about.
- That's quibbling. It walks.

177
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,870
And if I'm right and it talks, or communicates,

178
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,710
that means somewhere inside it is intelligence.

179
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,110
We've dissected them. There's no brain.

180
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,470
Something might do a brain's job.

181
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,340
Look at what they attack.
They almost always go for the head.

182
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,510
A great number of people who have been stung
but not killed have been blinded.

183
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,060
- That's significant.
- Of what?

184
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,670
They know the shortest way
of putting a man out of action.

185
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,110
If it were a choice of survival
between a blind man and a triffid,

186
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,350
- I know which I'd put my money on.
- You're assuming equal intelligence.

187
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,470
I'm not. They don't need
their intelligence to equal ours.

188
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,910

Even to just grow things and eat them raw.

192
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,830
They live off the soil
or from insects or bits of rotten meat.

193

Look at the complex process

195

and they've got everything they need to live.

196

That doesn't take very much intelligence.

Yes, that's right. I work on a triffid farm.

Not the ones we tap for oil.

247

The oil's better quality if we don't dock them.

00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,390
It's important to get out
before that kind of thing starts.

611
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,310
So...

612
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,470
Where do we go? Any ideas?

613
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:37,870
Somewhere out of the way...
with its own water supply. A well, perhaps.

614
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:42,150
And as high up as possible for a good, clean wind.

615
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,750
Lake District, Cornwall, Exmoor, Wales...

616
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:50,190
We'll have to get to towns for supplies
once it's safe again.

617
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,630
- How long will that be?
- I don't know.

618
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:56,910
How about Sussex?
The South Downs. I know a place there.

619
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:00,430
<i>It's a beautiful old farmhouse
overlooking Pulborough.</i>

620
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,950
It's not very high up.
But Dennis and Mary, they're great.

621
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:08,660
They're real do-it-yourself environment freaks.

622
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:15,390
A wind pump for water...
Make their own electricity. All that sort of thing.

623
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:19,670
Sounds ideal. A bit heavily populated
round there, but...

624
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,510
Look, let's leave the choice
of the place for a moment

625
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,110
and get down to what we need to do first.

626

Let's make a list. I like lists!

627

Now, then...

628
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,790
Oh, ta.

629
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,870
- Bill...
- Hmm?

630
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,790
- A signal.
- It means there's someone else who can see.

631
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:13,030

632

Marking the position so we can find it tomorrow.

633

Too dangerous to go out tonight.

634
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:24,670
It's the university tower, I think, but I'm not sure.
Anyway, better going in daylight.

635
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,790
For all we know, it could be a trap.

- So we should leave them to rot?

687

I think it comes to a very simple choice.

688
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,910
Either we say, ''There's been a catastrophe.

689
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:09,470
''Let's start again.
Let's save what can be saved...''

690
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:14,030
Or we say, ''No, those people will die.

691
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:17,390
''We must keep them alive as long as possible.''

692
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:21,340
On the face of it, that's the most humane choice.

693
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,150
For us, it's probably suicide.

694
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:28,430
We'd die. They'd die. We'd all die.

That's all it can be, a gesture!

Or do we join those people in there?

Out of those here now, most of them can see.

709
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:52,870
The rest are wives and husbands.
And there are two or three blind children.

01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:59,030
Sit down. The general idea is that we move out
of here tomorrow, if you can be ready,

711
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,350
to be on the safe side, you understand.

712
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:05,910
We decided to go this evening
for the same reason.

713
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:10,190
- Have you got any supplies?
- Not yet. We've gotta do that today.

714
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,030
- We do have anti-triffid gear.
- Oh?

715
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,900
Why do you give that such priority? Do sit down.

716
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:22,470
We know that a certain number have escaped,
probably from the zoo.

717
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,670
<i>We've seen them near Regent's Park.</i>

718
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,910
They killed my father
and the woman who worked for him.

719
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:32,870
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know that triffids can be very nasty

720
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:39,470
in parts of the world where they're not controlled,
but I think here they're a limited problem.

721
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:42,870
Go ahead.
Most of them are well fenced-in.

722
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,630
They break down fences
if they're not properly watched.

723
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,670
- I used to work on a triffid farm.
- Then I bow to your experience.

724
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:54,950
Anyway, today we must get everything
together which we need to take.

725
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:59,070
Here's a list. Find a lorry,
or two if you can both drive one.

726
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,510
- I think I can.
- Good.

727

Here's the addresses of some warehouses.

728
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,340
Stick to the list - cans and packets of food.

729
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,590
We don't want a duplication of goods.

730
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:15,510
There's a meeting this evening
to discuss everything. Got a pistol?

731
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,030
No.

732
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,390
- No.
- Better, just in case.

733
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:30,430
- No, I don't think so, thank you.
- Fire into the air. It's effective.

Very good. Excellent!

739
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:53,230
- What are these?
- That's the anti-triffid gear.

740
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,780
Guns, masks, suits, that sort of thing.

741
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,310
Did you see any triffids while you were out?

742
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,860
Not this time, no.

743
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:07,750
There have been no reports
of sightings by anyone else.

744
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,110
There won't be many in the centre of London.
It's like a desert to them.

745
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:17,550
They need soil for their roots, so they'll move
to the country, which is where we're going!

746
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:22,550

got two loads of food. We're taking that gear!

747
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,670
All right. If it doesn't take up very much room.

761
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,310
that you would prefer
to set up a group of your own.

762
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:36,040
The choice is yours.

763
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,110
The world as we knew it has ended.

764
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:46,300
Some of us may be feeling
it is the end of everything. But it isn't.

765
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:50,180
It can be, if we allow it.

766
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:57,150
During the last 35 years, the earth could
have been destroyed by a nuclear holocaust.

767
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:00,710
The earth has not been destroyed.

768
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:04,190
It can still provide us with food and raw materials.

769
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:09,270
We have repositories of knowledge that can
teach us to do anything we have done before.

770
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,510
We have the means.

771
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:16,750
And we have the health and the strength
to begin to build again.

772
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,670
Major Anderson will say a few words.

773
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,630
Thank you.

774
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,070
Good evening.

775
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,800
The convoy will depart at 1200 hours.

776
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:31,470
We cannot risk infection
by stopping longer than this.

777
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:36,870
We have obtained certain vaccines
with which our medical officer will inoculate us.

778
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:41,150
But we cannot protect ourselves
against all disease.

779
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:48,030
Any epidemic amongst us will wipe us out
or, at best, seriously reduce our number.

780
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:54,460
For this reason, we have been gathering
so many of the basic necessities of life.

781
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:58,230
For a minimum of one year,

782
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:03,420
we shall have to exist in what will be
virtually a state of siege.

783
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,470
(WOMAN) It is the future which is important.

784
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:11,070
All of us will have our parts to play
in creating that future.

785
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,830
The men must work.

786
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,430
The women must have babies.

787
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:20,220
We can support a limited number
of women who cannot see,

788
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:24,070
because they will have babies who can see.

789
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,470
We cannot support men who cannot see.

790
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:32,910
In our community, babies will be
more important than husbands.

791
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:38,830
It follows from this that the one man/
one woman relationship as we understand it

792
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,950
will probably become an illogical luxury.

793
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,470
We shall find that in many aspects of our lives,

794
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:50,230
the laws as we knew them
have been abolished by circumstances,

795
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:56,390
and it will fall to us to make new laws suitable
for the conditions in which we find ourselves.

796
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:01,630
Unless you find all this totally acceptable,

797
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:05,830
there is absolutely no point
in even thinking of joining us.

798
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,110
(QUIET DISCUSSION)

799
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:20,070
- How many do you think will join?
- Nearly all of them.

800
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:25,790
- Some women didn't like the sex angle.
- They'll come round to it.

801
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:29,950
What's the choice? To have babies
and a community to look after you,

802
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,580
or no babies and no one to look after you.

803
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:37,910
Most women want babies.
A husband is just a logical means to an end!

804
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:44,430
What do you think the arrangements will be?

805
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:47,790
They're taking some women who can't see.

806
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,430
So I think it'll be every man
who marries a girl who can see

807
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,510
must also take on one or two blind girls.

808
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:59,060
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

809
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:02,510
If I've got to have three wives...

810
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,470
..will you be one?

811
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:10,990
- On one condition.
- What?

812
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:14,190
I pick the other two.

813
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,990
So, what's the arrangements for tonight, then?

814
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:36,510
Strict segregation into dormitories.
There's no promiscuity till they say so.

815
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:47,590

- Why am I tied up?

Tell me where you are, I'll bring you the tea.

I'll go to the bed. Hang on.

01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:23,540
Lock up, Ted.

825
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,550
- Ta.
- There's a drop of rum in it.

- Bill.

Oh. I'm Alf.

01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,830
- Want a fag?
- Yeah. Ta.

829
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,390
Don't thank me. Everything's free nowadays.

(CHUCKLES)

831
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,660
You have to look on the bright side.

832
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:59,430
- My hands seem to be tied.
- Ah. Coker's orders.

833
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:04,110
- Who's Coker?
- Didn't you hear him yesterday at the university?

834
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:07,900
He was trying to get those bastards to help us.

835
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,830
All they did was shoot at us.

836
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,150
So Coker said they'd get what was coming to 'em.

837
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:20,910
He met up with a couple of others
who could see and they fixed it.

838
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:24,950
- You mean there wasn't a fire?
- Course there was a fire!

839
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:29,190
A sort of fire. They lit some paper,
rang a bell and shouted ''Fire!''

840
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:32,430
They fixed up some trip-wires on the stairs.

841
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:37,070
We knobbled as many of you as we could.
Coker's making us into parties.

842
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:41,510
We'll put one of you into each party.
You're the eyes for the rest.

You keep us going

My name's Jack Coker.

848
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:07,470
That's your area. Your party works only that area.

849
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:12,660
Your job is to find any food that's going,
see that your party gets it

850
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,910
and anything else they may need.

851
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:17,430
Understand?

852
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,190
Or what?

853
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:23,510
Or they'll get hungry, and some of them
are tough. We're not doing it for fun.

01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:26,390
Anyway, you'll be handcuffed to Ted and Alf.

855
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,630
- How will I be able to do the work?
- You won't.

856
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:35,310
You tell them what to do. When you're released,
as sometimes you'll have to be,

857
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:39,950
they've got a chain and cuffs
so that one leg and one arm can be locked

858
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:44,110
to a bedstead or pipe
before your handcuffs are undone.

859
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:48,190
- You've got it all worked out!
- Tomorrow we'll run you up there.

860
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:53,220
You have to look for somewhere to live.
A hotel or boarding house.

861
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:56,630
The beds would be there. That's up to you.

862

Once we dump you, you're on your own.
Until somebody comes to tidy things up.

- What if nobody comes?
- They've got to come.

864
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:10,430
You concentrate on doing your job.
Stick to your area.

<i>Can I ask you something?
Have you got a Miss Payton staying here?</i>

866
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:18,270
- Josella.
- I don't know their names.

867
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,950
- Tall, blonde, about 23?
- I think so.

868
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:25,150
- Tell her...
- I've got more important things to do.

869
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:30,350
Those people are totally dependent on you.

870
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:34,910
You may try and run out on them -
you may even find it's possible.

871
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:41,390
But I don't think you'll do it.
You'd be condemning them to die.

No.

what's going to Victoria and Westminster.

- Yeah.

staying here at the moment?

There's some people left -
three or four. None of us can see.

Look, if they've got rooms, we're having 'em.

- Watch your lip, mate!

- I'll smash your face in!
- Oh, very clever! Then what?

01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,390
He's right. Just shut it, Ted.

I don't think you quite understand.

We're here to get food. I can see.

the girl I was with at the university.

01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:57,510
You may remember us together.
She was tall, blonde, about 23.

<i>- Her name was Payton.
- Miss Payton?</i>

1099
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:05,110
No, I can't help you, I'm afraid.
She's certainly not here now.

1100
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:08,470
She may have gone with the others.
I can't be sure.

1101
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:12,230
- The others?
- Mr Beadley and Major Anderson.

1102
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:15,990
- And the others at the university.
- They're not here?

1103
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:20,390
They did come here. It was Mr Beadley
who knew of this house.

1104
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:25,350
But a few of us disagreed with their ideas
as to the future of society.

1105
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:29,270
Remember they gave us
an outline at the university?

1106
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:30,830
I remember.

1107
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,590
They believe the human race cannot survive

1108
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:37,910
without the complete abolition of morality
as we've understood it.

1109
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:41,590
That everything should be subservient
to the production of children,

1110
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:45,790
and whether or not a child is a child
of true love is of no importance.

1111
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:49,740
When they arrived, they repeated
that acceptance of their philosophy

1112
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:53,150
was a precondition of membership.

1113
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:56,990
We agreed to separate
and they volunteered to find somewhere else.

1114
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:59,540
Those of us that remain are Christian.

1115
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:02,790
We believe we must turn to Our Lord and say,

1116
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:06,310
''We put our trust in you. Your laws are our laws.

1117

and we know that our souls will survive.''

cattle, a fresh water supply.

It's not robbery. It's self-preservation.

1134

I've already planned for the blind
to be taught to do useful work.

Your vicar wanted them to learn basket weaving!

1136

You mustn't let him persuade you
to bring any more blind people here.

You can just about cope with what you have.
Any more and you've had it.

If you don't all starve to death,
the ones who can see will have breakdowns.

But there's more and more all the time!

1153
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:05,270
They seem to know where we are. They turned
towards us when they saw the lorries.

1154
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:08,270
Some even moved towards us.

They didn't see the lorries.
They're plants. They can't see.

The trouble with triffids is what we don't know.

Some scientists bred a very special plant
to produce a very special oil.

1158
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:32,190
We got the special oil
and we're lumbered with a special plant.

1159

- Has it got a brain?
- It's a plant!

I'm going back to Tynsham.

1165
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:02,230
No, it's not a snap decision.

1166
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:07,630
It's been growing all day,
driving through the desolation out there.

1167
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:12,630
Village after village, house after house.
Not a breath of human life anywhere.

1168
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:18,590
I've felt more lonely in these last few days
than I thought it possible.

1169
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:23,700
So...there's one reason - my human need.

1170
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:26,180
But the main reason is this.

1171
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:29,670
I've been working this out on the road.

1172
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:34,830
We must be part of a community
to have any hope for the future at all.

1173
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:39,630
At the moment we've got all we need.
Food, supplies, everything.

1174
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:43,870
But the food will go bad, the metal will rust,

1175
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:46,790
the petrol to drive the machines will run out.

1176
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:50,550
Before that happens,

1177
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:56,190
we have to learn to plough
and learn to make ploughs,

1178
01:58:56,360 --> 01:59:00,310
and learn to smelt the iron
to make the ploughshares.

1179
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:04,710
We must learn to make good
all that we wear out. If not...

1180
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:10,350
we say goodbye to civilisation
and we slide right back into savagery.

1181
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:18,030
All the knowledge is there in books

1182
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:20,870
if only we take the time to learn.

1183
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:24,230
Time, you see. Time.

1184
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:32,110
We need a community large enough
for some people to be free from production

1185
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:35,310
to have time to study and experiment

1186
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:40,470
and teach the kids to prepare for the day
when what we have is gone.

1187
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:46,070
- What did you do before all this happened?
- I taught history...very badly.

1188
01:59:46,240 --> 01:59:49,110
But I'm talking sense now.

1189
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,990
Yeah, I know.

1190
01:59:54,680 --> 01:59:59,430
I'll get my way at Tynsham.

Quite right.

1196
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:25,230

group. If she's not with them, I'll start again.

- The south.

- If I can find it and if she's there.

When you find her,
bring her straight back to Tynsham.

but I don't know quite where.

1216
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:19,430
- What are you going to do?
- Wait till it's dark, then we'll try our lights.

Bill! Bill! There's a light!

1219
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:28,550
I think there's a light.

Shall we go?

1221
02:06:21,320 --> 02:06:24,110
I've lost it. I've lost it!

1222
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:31,750
Over there!

1223
02:06:39,320 --> 02:06:40,630
(BILL) Damn!

1224
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:44,860
We'll have to go back.

1225
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:06,990
There! There!

1226
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:35,950
Hello, Bill. You've been a long time.

1227
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:52,750
Hey! Can't you kiss her indoors?

1228
02:07:54,680 --> 02:08:00,470
<i>(JO ) Perhaps I should have woken
Dennis and Mary, but I didn't see much point.</i>

1229
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:05,030
You'll meet them in the morning.

1230
02:08:06,040 --> 02:08:09,580
There were two other blind people staying here.

1231
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:13,790
But they went out to get help
and never came back.

1232
02:08:13,960 --> 02:08:17,070
- Triffids?
- I expect so.

1233
02:08:17,240 --> 02:08:21,310
- Are there many round here?
- Far too many.

1234
02:08:21,480 --> 02:08:24,150
Is everything very black?

1235
02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:26,430
No.

1236
02:08:27,680 --> 02:08:32,470
We know we're here, there's Beadley's group
and people at Tynsham.

1237
02:08:32,640 --> 02:08:36,390
There must be similar groups all over the world.

1238
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:41,830
It's gonna be a hell of a struggle,
but I think we might come through it.

1239
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:46,270
I think we all better go to Tynsham
as soon as we can.

1240
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:52,950
Coker said that the only way to survive
is to be part of a sizeable community.

1241
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:55,420
I'm sure he's right.

1242
02:08:56,600 --> 02:08:59,630
We'll have to wait until Mary's baby's born.

1243
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:02,790
It's due in a couple of weeks.

1244
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:07,750
Well, there's no hurry. This place will do for a bit.

1245
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:14,550
I'll drive to Tynsham in a few days,
tell them to be expecting us.

The disease. You could smell it.

There were bodies everywhere,
including Miss Durrant's.

- What about Coker?
- I dunno.

1252
02:11:14,280 --> 02:11:16,660
There were six new graves outside.

Where have you been? I've been worried stiff.

1256
02:14:42,820 --> 02:14:47,730
I had to change wheels three times
and take a 40-mile detour.

1257
02:14:47,900 --> 02:14:50,650
- Are the roads worse?
- Terrible.

- Did you get my jeans?

- A dozen pairs. I hope you stop growing!

02:15:00,180 --> 02:15:03,410
- Is David asleep?
- Of course he's not.

1261
02:15:04,140 --> 02:15:07,650
- Good night, Dad.

(MARY) It's time you were asleep,
so put that candle out.

1265
02:15:18,540 --> 02:15:20,570
Sorry, Mummy.

1266
02:15:22,620 --> 02:15:28,050
- How did you know it was on?
- I guessed. Supper's ready, Bill.

1267
02:15:36,900 --> 02:15:39,890
Mmm. Good pickings. Good pickings.

1268
02:15:40,060 --> 02:15:42,810
It was a good trip
from the store's point of view.

1269
02:15:42,980 --> 02:15:46,890
I got nearly everything we wanted,
including the new Braille books.

1270
02:15:47,060 --> 02:15:50,010
- How's London looking?
- Greener and greener.

1271
02:15:50,180 --> 02:15:54,810
- I suppose the parks have gone wild?
- They've taken over some streets.

1272
02:15:54,980 --> 02:15:56,970
- (JO ) Must be eerie.
- It is.

1273
02:15:57,140 --> 02:16:00,330
- Are there any signs of life?
- A few cats and dogs.

1274
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:04,890
Triffids, of course. I'm pretty certain
other people go raiding there.

1275
02:16:05,060 --> 02:16:09,010
There's indications of that,
but I didn't see anybody.

1276
02:16:09,180 --> 02:16:13,330
- I think it's my last visit, too.
- Why?

1277
02:16:14,460 --> 02:16:18,610
I was cruising down Tottenham Court Road
and a building collapsed.

1278
02:16:18,780 --> 02:16:20,290
Oh, my God!

1279
02:16:20,460 --> 02:16:24,210
It was ready to go. The vibration
of the Land Rover did the rest.

1280
02:16:24,380 --> 02:16:29,970
From now on, it'll have to be smaller towns.
We'll get what we need in a hand-barrow.

1281
02:16:30,140 --> 02:16:33,170
- Did you find another flame-thrower?
- I got two.

1282
02:16:33,340 --> 02:16:37,120
Not much of the fuel, though.
There's not much of that anywhere.

1283
02:16:37,300 --> 02:16:41,770
- What was the triffid count this morning?
- Over a thousand.

1284
02:16:41,940 --> 02:16:45,250
But it's only ten days
since you wiped them all out.

1285
02:16:45,420 --> 02:16:49,650
- Did you see many between here and London?
- Not in these numbers.

1286
02:16:49,820 --> 02:16:51,610
- You suggest we move?
- No.

1287
02:16:51,780 --> 02:16:56,170
We've got a good place, a place we know.
You need that when you can't see.

1288
02:16:56,340 --> 02:16:59,880
You built a fence. They're on the outside,
we're on the in.

1289
02:17:00,060 --> 02:17:02,890
If you burn them off, there's no real problem.

Are you sure this is safe?

1303
02:18:56,740 --> 02:19:02,770
I doubt if triffids can walk on shingle.
They'd make a hell of a noise.

1304
02:19:07,260 --> 02:19:10,880
It's so marvellous
to get out of the compound!

Oh! Look at the gulls!

1306
02:19:18,060 --> 02:19:21,810
To watch them, you could almost think
nothing had ever happened.

1307
02:19:21,980 --> 02:19:26,650
There are more of them this year.
I'm glad about that.

1308
02:19:27,940 --> 02:19:31,130
Are our chances getting better?

1309
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:36,850
If it weren't for the triffids,
I'd say we had a very good chance.

1310
02:19:37,020 --> 02:19:41,210
There hasn't been a single break-in
since we electrified the fence.

1311
02:19:41,380 --> 02:19:45,450
If we kept the generator running all the time,
the fence would be wonderful,

1312
02:19:45,620 --> 02:19:49,050
but you know we can't get enough fuel.

1313
02:19:49,220 --> 02:19:52,490
But I thought we'd found the answer to that.

1314
02:19:52,660 --> 02:19:56,890
Turn it on for a few minutes
at a different time each day.

1315
02:19:57,060 --> 02:20:03,160
Susan says they'll work it out.
She says they can hear the generator.

1316
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:08,090
Sometimes I think they do have intelligence.

1317
02:20:08,260 --> 02:20:13,200
They know their purpose is to get us.
And sooner or later they will.

No! Look, we're gonna beat them. We've got to.

spending all their time keeping triffids out.

Oh, God, I'm sorry. Here I am being depressing

1321
02:20:28,140 --> 02:20:33,450
when it's the first time we've paused
from the business of keeping alive.

1322
02:20:33,620 --> 02:20:36,000
And I am alive.

I'm sorry about the weather.

1326
02:21:08,860 --> 02:21:11,290
What are we going to tell the children?

1327
02:21:12,220 --> 02:21:17,290
Sooner or later they're going to want to know
why all this has happened.

1328
02:21:17,460 --> 02:21:21,610
Do we tell them that the world
was wonderfully clever

1329
02:21:21,780 --> 02:21:24,890
but so very wicked it had to be destroyed?

1330
02:21:26,060 --> 02:21:29,170
Or do we tell them it destroyed itself by accident?

1331
02:21:32,260 --> 02:21:34,850
We tell them the truth.

1332
02:21:35,020 --> 02:21:37,480
We destroyed it.

1333
02:21:38,820 --> 02:21:43,050
- We created the triffids.
- We didn't create the comet.

1334
02:21:44,900 --> 02:21:46,690
Was it a comet?

1335
02:21:48,300 --> 02:21:50,290
What do you mean?

1336
02:21:52,380 --> 02:21:56,450
Do you know how many satellites
were going round up there?

1337
02:21:56,620 --> 02:22:00,770
How many weapons?
Or what was in the weapons?

1338
02:22:01,780 --> 02:22:04,050
They never told us.

1339
02:22:04,220 --> 02:22:06,520
They never asked us.

1340
02:22:07,540 --> 02:22:11,930
I suppose one of these weapons
had been specially constructed

1341
02:22:12,100 --> 02:22:15,720
to emit a radiation that our eyes couldn't stand.

1342
02:22:15,900 --> 02:22:18,570
Something that would burn out the optic nerve.

1343
02:22:18,740 --> 02:22:22,930
- That couldn't blind the whole world.
- Suppose there was an accident.

1344
02:22:23,940 --> 02:22:29,410
This weapon would operate at low levels,
only blinding people they wanted to blind.

1345
02:22:29,580 --> 02:22:33,010
But after the accident, it went off so far up

1346
02:22:33,180 --> 02:22:37,530
that anyone on earth could receive
direct radiation from it.

1347
02:22:38,620 --> 02:22:43,370
What about the mysterious disease?
Where did that come from?

1348
02:22:47,260 --> 02:22:51,330
We were walking on a tightrope
for a hell of a long time.

1349
02:22:51,500 --> 02:22:54,650
Sooner or later, a foot had to slip.

1350
02:22:57,620 --> 02:22:59,970
Well, if that's right,

1351
02:23:01,060 --> 02:23:05,090
it means our children can't make
a worse mess of it than we did.

1352
02:23:05,260 --> 02:23:07,970
And that's cheering for them.

1353
02:23:08,700 --> 02:23:10,290
Yes, it is.

It's great to see you. It's six years
since we've seen another human being.

1361
02:24:12,380 --> 02:24:15,450
Sit down. Tell me what happened to you.

1362
02:24:15,620 --> 02:24:19,090
- I went to Tynsham to look for you.
- The disease hit us.

1363
02:24:19,260 --> 02:24:23,770
- Yes. I found Miss Durrant's body.
- She stayed to nurse the sick.

1364
02:24:23,940 --> 02:24:28,290
I admired her, but those who can survive must.
I took the healthy ones away.

1365
02:24:28,460 --> 02:24:31,090
So where's the helicopter from?

1366
02:24:31,260 --> 02:24:35,040
- Did you know we were here?
- I knew where to look.

1367
02:24:35,220 --> 02:24:39,770
We're on the Isle of Wight. That's
my third helicopter. I smashed the others up!

1368
02:24:39,940 --> 02:24:44,010
- Well, you try learning to fly from a book.
- (LAUGHTER)

1369
02:24:44,180 --> 02:24:47,210
We're getting things organised over there now.

1370
02:24:47,380 --> 02:24:50,370
An island is the only defence against triffids.

1371
02:24:50,540 --> 02:24:54,240
- There are no triffids there?
- They were there.

1372
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:58,410
We moved into a large house.
They congregated in thousands.

1373
02:24:58,580 --> 02:25:01,250
We wiped them out with flame-throwers.
More came.

1374
02:25:01,420 --> 02:25:03,610
We must have wiped out 50,000 at least.

1375
02:25:03,780 --> 02:25:09,330
Then, when they didn't come any more,
we hunted them down and destroyed them.

1376
02:25:09,500 --> 02:25:15,370
The seeds still blow across,
but we have a hunt for those every spring.

1377
02:25:15,540 --> 02:25:20,010
- That's wonderful.
- (JO ) Are there other inhabited places?

1378
02:25:20,180 --> 02:25:23,490
I've come across several since I've been flying.

1379
02:25:23,660 --> 02:25:28,650
I ask if they want to join us. Some do, some
don't - those who don't want to be governed.

1380
02:25:28,820 --> 02:25:34,570
A large group in Brighton shot at the helicopter,
so I left them to stew.

1381
02:25:35,300 --> 02:25:38,490
There's several hundred of us now -
who can see, I mean,

1382
02:25:38,660 --> 02:25:40,690
and a good few blind as well.

1383
02:25:40,860 --> 02:25:43,420
What we need is you.

1384
02:25:43,580 --> 02:25:45,330
Me?

1385
02:25:46,380 --> 02:25:50,730
We can keep the triffids away from the island,
but that's not enough.

1386
02:25:50,900 --> 02:25:55,650
We've got to find a selective killer to finish them.
That means research.

1387
02:25:55,820 --> 02:26:01,090
You were a biologist on a triffid farm.
We can give you facilities, help.

1388
02:26:01,260 --> 02:26:04,850
We need your experience and skill.
Are you interested?

1389
02:26:05,020 --> 02:26:06,810
- Yes, very!
- Good.

1390
02:26:06,980 --> 02:26:11,840
- If Bill goes, we all go.
- Of course. One thing I should make clear.

1391
02:26:12,020 --> 02:26:17,770
We have all agreed we're...we're not out
to reconstruct the world as it was.

1392
02:26:17,940 --> 02:26:21,250
We want to build something new, better.

1393
02:26:21,420 --> 02:26:25,570
Some people don't agree with that.
They want to keep the old features.

1394
02:26:25,740 --> 02:26:29,690
If anybody doesn't like us,
we ask them to move somewhere else.

1395
02:26:29,860 --> 02:26:33,370
''Somewhere else'' sounds like a poor offer.

1396
02:26:33,540 --> 02:26:37,650
I don't mean we throw them back to the triffids.

1397
02:26:37,820 --> 02:26:42,090
One group did move to the Channel Islands.
I believe they're doing well.

1398
02:26:42,260 --> 02:26:47,410
Anyway, the best way to learn about us
is to come and find out for yourselves.

1399
02:26:47,580 --> 02:26:51,330
I'm sure we will take to each other,
but if we don't,

1400
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:55,570
you'll find the Channel Islands is better than this
a few years from now.

1401
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:18,130
(BILL) Isn't it what we've been waiting for?

1402
02:27:18,300 --> 02:27:19,890
(JO ) I know.

1403
02:27:21,100 --> 02:27:25,690
We must beat the triffids.
We can't do it here. We must go.

1404
02:27:25,860 --> 02:27:30,010
Bill, couldn't we have one more summer here?

1405
02:27:30,180 --> 02:27:34,610
One more summer without any worry
'cause we know we've got somewhere to go.

1406
02:27:34,780 --> 02:27:37,240
One marvellous summer.

1407
02:27:37,420 --> 02:27:41,610
I suggest we go the first day of autumn.

1408
02:27:48,620 --> 02:27:51,210
(FLIES BUZZ)

1409
02:27:55,980 --> 02:27:59,570
# We all live in a yellow submarine

1410
02:27:59,740 --> 02:28:03,250
# A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine

1411
02:28:03,420 --> 02:28:06,810
# And our friends are all aboard

1412
02:28:06,980 --> 02:28:10,970
# Many more of them live next door... #

1413
02:28:47,700 --> 02:28:51,770
My name's Torrence.
I'm Commander, South-East region.

1414
02:28:51,940 --> 02:28:57,490
I'm Chief Executive Officer
of the Emergency Council for the South-East.

1415
02:28:57,660 --> 02:29:04,050
As such, I supervise the distribution
and allocation of personnel.

1416
02:29:05,180 --> 02:29:08,650
I'm sorry, but I've never heard of this council.

1417
02:29:08,820 --> 02:29:13,370
We were equally ignorant of your group
until we saw your fire yesterday.

1418
02:29:13,540 --> 02:29:15,920
When such a group is discovered,

1419
02:29:16,100 --> 02:29:19,330
it's my job to investigate it
and make adjustments.

1420
02:29:19,500 --> 02:29:21,850
It's a good place you've taken over.

1421
02:29:22,020 --> 02:29:25,770
- It belongs to Mr Brent.
- We can leave Mr Brent out of it.

1422
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:29,450
He's only here now because you made it possible.

1423
02:29:29,620 --> 02:29:34,130
The society which gave sanction
to his ownership no longer exists.

1424
02:29:34,300 --> 02:29:38,850
Mr Brent is not sighted
and so is not competent to hold authority.

1425
02:29:39,020 --> 02:29:42,450
There are seven of you,
all sighted except these two.

1426
02:29:42,620 --> 02:29:44,330
Yes.

1427
02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:49,570
That's quite disproportionate, I'm afraid.
We have to be realistic these days.

1428
02:29:54,460 --> 02:29:59,610
I'd better put you in the picture.
Regional headquarters is in Brighton.

1429
02:29:59,780 --> 02:30:04,290
We survived the sickness
and we had plenty of stores.

1430
02:30:04,460 --> 02:30:07,090
Later on we conveyed them from other places.

1431
02:30:07,260 --> 02:30:10,930
But the roads are getting too bad for lorries now.

1432
02:30:11,100 --> 02:30:16,730
So we've got to disperse and live off the land.
To do this, we've got to break into smaller units.

1433
02:30:16,900 --> 02:30:22,090
The unit has been fixed at one sighted person
to ten blind, plus children.

1434
02:30:22,260 --> 02:30:26,850
We shall allocate you 18 more blind persons,
making 20 with the two you have here.

1435
02:30:27,020 --> 02:30:32,140
20? This land won't support 20 people.
It's enough just to feed ourselves.

1436
02:30:32,300 --> 02:30:36,490
It's perfectly possible. I'm offering you
command of the double unit here.

1437
02:30:36,660 --> 02:30:40,530
If you don't take it, we shall get someone else in.

1438
02:30:40,700 --> 02:30:44,970
- Look at the place! It can't be done.
- It can be done.

1439
02:30:45,140 --> 02:30:48,450
Of course, you'll have to lower
your standards a bit.

1440
02:30:48,620 --> 02:30:52,010
For the first six or seven years it'll be hard work.

1441
02:30:52,180 --> 02:30:57,090
But after that, you'll be able to relax
until you're simply supervising.

1442
02:30:57,260 --> 02:31:02,690
You'll be head of a clan and you'll have
an inheritance to hand on to your sons.

1443
02:31:04,740 --> 02:31:07,570
Do I understand that...

1444
02:31:08,660 --> 02:31:12,250
you're offering to make me a kind of feudal lord?

1445
02:31:12,420 --> 02:31:14,980
That's a very good parallel in many ways.

1446
02:31:15,140 --> 02:31:20,080
It's the obvious social and economic structure
for the state of things we're facing now.

1447
02:31:20,260 --> 02:31:26,770
<i>Yes. I don't quite see. Perhaps you could explain
where you and your council stand in all this?</i>

1448
02:31:26,940 --> 02:31:30,810
Supreme authority is vested
in the council. It will rule.

1449
02:31:30,980 --> 02:31:34,810
- It will also control the armed forces.
- Armed forces?

1450
02:31:34,980 --> 02:31:38,760
Then, of course,
there's the rest of the world to consider.

1451
02:31:38,940 --> 02:31:41,850
Everywhere must be in the same sort of chaos.

1452
02:31:42,020 --> 02:31:45,970
It's our national duty to assume a dominant role

1453
02:31:46,140 --> 02:31:48,370
and discourage any aggressors.

1454
02:31:48,540 --> 02:31:55,050
- God almighty! He wants to start a war.
- ''War'' is an unjustifiable exaggeration.

1455
02:31:55,220 --> 02:31:58,530
It will simply be a matter of pacifying the tribes

1456
02:31:58,700 --> 02:32:02,370
that have reverted to primitive lawlessness.

1457
02:32:04,540 --> 02:32:07,730
To come back to the matter of allocation.

1458
02:32:07,900 --> 02:32:13,410
You have three sighted adults here.
Your 20 blind people only rate two.

1459
02:32:13,580 --> 02:32:15,730
The girl can come to headquarters.

1460
02:32:15,900 --> 02:32:20,530
We shall find suitable work
until she's old enough to take charge of a unit.

1461
02:32:20,700 --> 02:32:26,610
Er... My wife and I regard Susan as our daughter.

1462
02:32:26,780 --> 02:32:29,530
I'm sorry. Those are the regulations.

1463
02:32:29,700 --> 02:32:32,260
I am empowered to enforce them.

1464
02:32:32,420 --> 02:32:36,530
We'd require guarantees
and undertakings as to Susan's future.

1465
02:32:36,700 --> 02:32:41,290
Naturally, we shall offer you
all possible assurances.

1466
02:32:41,460 --> 02:32:45,240
I trust you'll be our guests for tonight.

1467
02:32:46,300 --> 02:32:49,570
Give us a chance to get to know each other, eh?

1468
02:32:51,260 --> 02:32:52,850
You're very kind.

1469
02:32:55,660 --> 02:32:58,810
(RAUCOUS LAUGHTER)

1470
02:32:58,980 --> 02:33:00,770

1471

They're not going to take you anywhere.

If you'd ordered this in a restaurant,
you'd have fainted when you got the bill.

1475
02:33:25,340 --> 02:33:27,610
I liberated it.

1476
02:33:27,780 --> 02:33:31,770
- Let's liberate another.
- No, we can't take all your best.

1477
02:33:31,940 --> 02:33:35,720
Nonsense! You can't take it with you.
And if you can, you're not going to!
