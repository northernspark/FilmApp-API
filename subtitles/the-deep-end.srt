00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:09,948
I'm looking for Darby Reese.

3
00:01:11,157 --> 00:01:13,785
Does he know you're coming?

4
00:01:13,785 --> 00:01:15,912
No, he doesn't.

5
00:01:33,848 --> 00:01:35,558
Darby.

6
00:01:35,683 --> 00:01:38,060
Someone's mom's here to see you.

7
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:41,439
Yeah, all right.

8
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:44,984
All right. Yeah. Who'd you say you are?

9
00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:47,654
Margaret Hall.

10
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:51,575
He'll be right down.

11
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,356
How about this?

12
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:23,691
- Mother of Beau.
- Mr Reese.

13
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:26,403
You're younger than I expected. Please, sit.

14
00:02:26,444 --> 00:02:29,239
I wantyou to stay away from my son.

15
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:33,618
Does Beau know you're here?

16
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:49,093
- Where are your sneakers?
- Don't know.

17
00:04:49,218 --> 00:04:51,429
Please find them. You'll catch a cold.

18
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:54,307
Oh, Jack! I'm sorry.

19
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:57,643
Margaret, where on earth
is that damned remote?

20
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:03,399
I don't know. Broken, isn't it?
Didn't Dylan step on it last night?

21
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:05,652
For the love of Pete.

22
00:05:05,693 --> 00:05:08,363
Try the one in the study. I think it'll work.

23
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:11,491
- And where is Mr Dylan?
- He's in the driveway.

24
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,578
Dylan.

25
00:05:24,755 --> 00:05:27,633
- Sweetheart, where's your brother?
- In the driveway.

26
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:31,303
- I mean Beau.
- He took off in the boat.

27
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:34,056
Mad about something. I don't know.

28
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:28,279
Been gone a while, kiddo.

29
00:06:35,787 --> 00:06:39,708
- I went to Reno today.
- I know. He called.

30
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,379
I'm going upstairs.

31
00:06:48,968 --> 00:06:51,637
May I come in?

32
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:57,143
May I come in?

33
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:06,736
- I need to talk to you.
- You talk to everybody lately.

34
00:07:06,736 --> 00:07:10,615
- Please don't be glib.
- Like I told you, he's my friend. That's all.

35
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,743
Well, he may not be the friend you think he is.

36
00:07:13,785 --> 00:07:16,246
He's just a guy, all right? Just a place.

37
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:21,335
- You've got to talkto me about the drinking...
- I shouldn't have been driving. I'm sorry.

38
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,004
You shouldn't have been
visiting nightclubs...

39
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:25,798
- Are we through?
- No!

40
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:28,843
You could have been killed in that accident.

41
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:35,558
I know you're having difficulty...

42
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:41,105
If you're having feelings...

43
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:46,820
I don't know what it is you think I feel, but
you're blowing this thing out of proportion.

44
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:54,327
He offered to stay away from you.

45
00:07:55,912 --> 00:07:58,081
- What?
- For money.

46
00:07:58,206 --> 00:08:00,667
He said if I paid him, he'd stay away.

47
00:08:02,002 --> 00:08:04,213
$5,000.

48
00:08:07,216 --> 00:08:09,301
- I don't believe you.
- It's true.

49
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:13,389
- He said you'd tell me things.
- Beau, stop. Would I lie to you?

50
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:17,977
- Was Darby with you Friday night?
- Just let it go.

51
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:22,106
- I don't want you seeing him.
- Do we have to talk about this now?

52
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:26,903
I don't want you going into Reno. We can
put the music lessons on hold for a while.

53
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:29,864
Margaret, it's Tom.

54
00:08:37,205 --> 00:08:40,334
Yes. Tom, it's Margaret.

55
00:08:41,877 --> 00:08:44,046
It's good to hear you, too.

56
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:47,383
Everything's fine. We're all fine.

57
00:08:48,676 --> 00:08:50,553
What?

58
00:08:50,553 --> 00:08:52,680
I can't hear you.

59
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:55,474
Yeah. Dylan's helping me.

60
00:08:56,642 --> 00:09:00,313
He's making Xs on the calendar.
Don't you disappoint him.

61
00:09:03,358 --> 00:09:05,235
Beau?

62
00:09:05,902 --> 00:09:08,488
Well, hold on a sec. He's right here.

63
00:09:13,326 --> 00:09:15,078
Hi.

64
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,789
I'm fine. Yeah, the same stuff.

65
00:09:17,831 --> 00:09:20,042
Yeah, school, water polo, you know.

66
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:22,586
No, no. No answers yet.

67
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,339
Wesleyan lost my transcripts.

68
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:27,841
Yeah.

69
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:32,179
I'm not playing as much as I'd like,
but I'm enjoying the classes.

70
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:37,643
No, the drive's been fine.

71
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:40,063
I miss you, too.

72
00:10:35,912 --> 00:10:38,123
Are you crazy? That's my mother's room.

73
00:10:38,248 --> 00:10:41,001
- It's me.
- Yeah, I can see that.

74
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:44,088
- You wanna have some fun?
- No!

75
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:48,050
- Go away. You're gonna wake everyone up.
- Come on!

76
00:10:48,175 --> 00:10:50,845
Just go away. Someone's gonna see you.

77
00:10:50,886 --> 00:10:53,556
Hey, I came all the way from Reno.

78
00:10:54,515 --> 00:10:57,226
- Come on.
- All right.

79
00:10:58,102 --> 00:11:00,188
Quiet. Just be quiet.

80
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:02,732
I'll be right down. Don't move.

81
00:12:04,963 --> 00:12:08,175
Make a sound,
I'm gonna drown you in the lake.

82
00:12:09,468 --> 00:12:11,554
Come on.

83
00:12:15,391 --> 00:12:17,685
Whatever you say, lover.

84
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:21,814
Light a match or somethin'.

85
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:24,859
Yeah. Much better.

86
00:12:28,238 --> 00:12:30,532
I'm sorry about my mother.

87
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:34,494
I thought I was your little secret.
Imagine my surprise.

88
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:37,205
She knew I was at the club
Friday night, that's all.

89
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:40,584
- She doesn't really know...
- She knows, believe me.

90
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:44,254
- Why are you saying that?
- Poor Beau.

91
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:46,548
She's a mother, not a moron.

92
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:49,301
Shut up.

93
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:53,180
She was bound to find out.
That's the way things work.

94
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:56,184
I just don't want you
talking to her any more, OK?

95
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,269
- Or to anyone else.
- All right!

96
00:12:58,394 --> 00:13:01,522
No one. I'm serious. It's my business...

97
00:13:01,522 --> 00:13:03,816
Whatever you want, precious.

98
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:08,947
What did you talk to her about?
What did you say to her?

99
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:11,950
Nothing. Well, not much.

100
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:16,121
You gotta relax, beauty.

101
00:13:16,246 --> 00:13:19,374
Why? What did she tell you?

102
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,920
Did she ask you to stay away from me?

103
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,757
- I believe she did.
- And?

104
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:29,468
And I...

105
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:33,597
All right, I...

106
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:39,145
I told her I might be amenable
to a little negotiation.

107
00:13:39,228 --> 00:13:41,564
Friendly to an offer.

108
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:45,151
Beau...

109
00:13:48,321 --> 00:13:50,907
To stop seeing me.

110
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:54,953
Of course I was lying. You knowthat.

111
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:58,957
I know what? Thatyou tried
to steal money from my mother?

112
00:13:59,124 --> 00:14:02,628
- It's only money. Don't take it so personally.
- Get off me.

113
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:06,131
Look, I need money.
Haven't you noticed? I tend to overindulge.

114
00:14:06,298 --> 00:14:08,551
I said don't touch me.

115
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:18,478
That hurt, you little fuck.

116
00:14:20,605 --> 00:14:22,690
Hey, come on, come on.

117
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,195
- Look, I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.
- Get off my arm.

118
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:29,197
Beau, Beau...

119
00:14:44,588 --> 00:14:46,882
Jesus. You're not being a very good host.

120
00:14:46,924 --> 00:14:49,927
- Get out. Get outta here.
- Easy, tiger.

121
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,154
- Get the fuck outta here.
- That hurt.

122
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:20,959
Beau, Beau, come on.

123
00:15:22,002 --> 00:15:22,920
Beau.

124
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:41,439
Jesus, Beau.

125
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:53,326
Beau!

126
00:15:53,326 --> 00:15:55,579
Sweetheart, what happened?

127
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,125
Beau?

128
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,796
I thought I was the only one up.

129
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:11,470
- You're sure I shouldn't go?
- Yes, I'll be right back.

130
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,900
- Problem?
- No, just the wind.

131
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:06,653
Did I hear Beau earlier?

132
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,115
No, I don't think so.
Why don't you get to bed? It's late.

133
00:17:22,044 --> 00:17:24,088
Margaret? Is thatyou?

134
00:17:25,297 --> 00:17:27,466
- You're up early.
- Trouble sleeping.

135
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:29,927
- Going for a swim?
- Too cold.

136
00:17:30,344 --> 00:17:32,805
Just a walk. Maybe I'll run a little.

137
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:27,570
Where have you been?
I lost my mitt. I can't find it.

138
00:24:27,695 --> 00:24:30,573
- It's around. We'll find it.
- Were you out in the boat?

139
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:34,453
- Is Paige ready to go?
- You been AWOL quite a while, Maggie.

140
00:24:34,494 --> 00:24:37,789
- Did you look under your bed?
- I thoughtyou were out in the boat.

141
00:24:37,998 --> 00:24:41,585
Go look under your bed.
Paige, the Lloyds are here!

142
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,382
- Is Beau up?
- Beau? No, I haven't seen him.

143
00:24:46,423 --> 00:24:49,260
So, you took a spin on the lake?

144
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:51,345
Paige, slow down, please.

145
00:24:52,763 --> 00:24:55,516
- Hey, hey. Gangplank.
- Honey, the Lloyds are waiting.

146
00:24:55,683 --> 00:24:59,228
- Where were you all morning?
- Mom, I can't find it.

147
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,858
Dylan, please. It's time to go - now.

148
00:25:04,984 --> 00:25:08,655
You'll just have to borrow a glove
from someone. It won't be so bad.

149
00:25:08,655 --> 00:25:11,157
- You can't just borrow a mitt.
- Course you can.

150
00:25:14,327 --> 00:25:16,580
Who's gonna let me borrowtheir mitt?

151
00:25:16,788 --> 00:25:20,250
You'll work it out, Dyl.
People like to share. Go on.

152
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:23,337
- Running late?
- Yes, sorry. Lost track of the time.

153
00:25:23,337 --> 00:25:26,715
Do you mind picking up?
I have a tennis thing I can't get out of.

154
00:25:26,715 --> 00:25:29,677
- If you can't...
- No, I'll manage. It's not a problem.

155
00:25:29,802 --> 00:25:32,138
Great. Bye-bye.

156
00:30:19,812 --> 00:30:22,774
- What happened last night?
- Wesleyan wants another music sample.

157
00:30:23,066 --> 00:30:25,360
I'm being considered for a grant.

158
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,870
I need $50 for the session.

159
00:30:36,872 --> 00:30:39,541
All right. So what happened last night?

160
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:43,170
Can you give me a ride?
Cos I'm late for water polo already.

161
00:30:48,217 --> 00:30:50,052
Beau.

162
00:30:50,052 --> 00:30:52,847
What do you want me to say?
Thatyou were right?

163
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:54,807
Fine. You were right, OK?

164
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,811
- I just wanna know what happened.
- Look, I'm already late.

165
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,230
You're bruised and scraped.

166
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,067
Something happened
and you've got to tell me...

167
00:31:04,108 --> 00:31:06,361
Oh, there you are!

168
00:31:08,947 --> 00:31:12,576
I thought we were gonna
take that skiff out for a spin.

169
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:17,914
I just got back. Beau needs a ride to school.
Will you be all right for a little while?

170
00:31:17,998 --> 00:31:21,168
I was out on the dock.
I couldn't see you there.

171
00:31:22,002 --> 00:31:25,673
Found this, anyway.
On the beach in the sand, plain as day.

172
00:31:25,881 --> 00:31:28,926
I'm surprised you didn't see it
this morning on your walk.

173
00:31:28,968 --> 00:31:31,721
No. No, I didn't.

174
00:31:37,435 --> 00:31:39,562
What happened to your face?

175
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:03,962
You're not gonna say anything to Dad?

176
00:32:05,172 --> 00:32:07,299
You know, about last night?

177
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,511
No.

178
00:32:10,594 --> 00:32:14,223
All right. I'll find a ride back. Bye.

179
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:29,176
I think boy ballerinas just don't look right.
They look so funny.

180
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:31,387
I perfectly agree with you.

181
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:34,890
You know, he put on
his tights the wrong way.

182
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:38,519
I think it's very funny.

183
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:44,150
Hey, are you sure you're not getting a crush?

184
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:47,195
You know I was just kidding.

185
00:33:47,404 --> 00:33:49,531
Yeah.

186
00:33:50,782 --> 00:33:52,826
Hey, look!

187
00:33:52,951 --> 00:33:57,372
- What's going on? Did somebody drown?
- Keep movin'.

188
00:34:02,336 --> 00:34:05,798
Yes, I'm trying to get through
to Captain Thomas Hall.

189
00:34:08,634 --> 00:34:11,137
The USS Constellation.

190
00:34:19,228 --> 00:34:21,606
His wife Margaret.

191
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:24,317
Please don't put me on hold again.

192
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:32,617
I need to speakto him today. Right now.

193
00:34:34,536 --> 00:34:37,956
I realise they left port. I told you I'm his wife.

194
00:34:39,207 --> 00:34:41,877
Well, no, it's not exactly an emergency.

195
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:52,763
His wife, Margaret.

196
00:35:01,606 --> 00:35:03,274
All right.

197
00:35:03,274 --> 00:35:05,777
No, no message. Thank you.

198
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,524
He's dead.

199
00:35:44,484 --> 00:35:48,154
Darby's dead. He was killed Monday night.

200
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,282
- That night he was here.
- Beau.

201
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:52,617
It's in the paper. Look.

202
00:36:01,794 --> 00:36:05,464
- Did he know other people in Tahoe?
- How should I know?

203
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:08,050
He knew everybody.

204
00:36:13,764 --> 00:36:18,186
The police are saying
someone murdered him.

205
00:36:18,186 --> 00:36:20,480
Did anybody else know he was coming?

206
00:36:21,397 --> 00:36:24,317
Did anybody know you were friends?

207
00:36:26,277 --> 00:36:28,655
Does it matter? Mom, he's dead!

208
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:33,201
I don't know. Do you think
the police will want to speak with you?

209
00:36:35,912 --> 00:36:38,999
I don't know. I don't know.

210
00:36:46,757 --> 00:36:49,260
Must be a real relief to you though.

211
00:36:50,261 --> 00:36:52,430
- I mean, him being dead.
- Beau, please.

212
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:55,600
That's gotta have some appeal.
Can't bother you, can't bother me.

213
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:59,687
- Stop it, for Christ's sake.
- You know, you were right, Mom.

214
00:36:59,812 --> 00:37:02,690
He was a loser. Now it's just in the paper.

215
00:37:11,032 --> 00:37:16,121
Mom! There's a man downstairs.
He wanted to talkto Dad, but I told him...

216
00:37:16,163 --> 00:37:19,249
- Who'd he say he is?
- He didn't.

217
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:21,793
All right, I'm coming.

218
00:37:31,554 --> 00:37:36,309
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. I came to see Tom Hall.

219
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:40,396
- He isn't in.
- I can wait. I told that to the girl.

220
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:43,524
I'm his wife.

221
00:37:43,566 --> 00:37:46,820
- When will he be back?
- He won't be. Not today.

222
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,241
What exactly is ityou want?

223
00:37:54,035 --> 00:37:57,706
I came to talk about
Darby Reese and your son.

224
00:38:06,048 --> 00:38:08,050
Dylan.

225
00:38:08,175 --> 00:38:10,427
I need you to play somewhere else.

226
00:38:10,427 --> 00:38:13,055
- Why?
- I need to speak with this man.

227
00:38:15,182 --> 00:38:18,644
- Promise you won't touch the computer?
- Yes, I promise.

228
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:24,025
I think you know Darby Reese.

229
00:38:25,235 --> 00:38:28,279
So, you must know he is dead.

230
00:38:30,031 --> 00:38:32,409
Murdered.

231
00:38:35,328 --> 00:38:39,625
Your son's been spending
a lot of time with Mr Reese.

232
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:43,045
Special time. Sort of intimate.

233
00:38:43,629 --> 00:38:45,589
Forgot my fish book.

234
00:38:48,676 --> 00:38:52,138
Dyl, Dyl. No more interruptions.
You understand?

235
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:54,140
Sorry.

236
00:39:00,063 --> 00:39:03,483
We know Darby was coming here
Monday night to see Beau.

237
00:39:04,817 --> 00:39:07,278
- The night he was killed.
- "We"?

238
00:39:07,404 --> 00:39:09,614
- Yeah, I have a partner.
- Partner?

239
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:12,617
- Beau's done nothing wrong.
- Maybe.

240
00:39:12,742 --> 00:39:16,663
- I said he's done nothing wrong.
- So why haven't you gone to the police?

241
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:20,459
- Why don't they know that your son and...
- Is there a point to this?

242
00:39:20,584 --> 00:39:24,171
We think your son is mixed up
in a murder. That's the point.

243
00:39:24,171 --> 00:39:26,256
I think you should go now.

244
00:39:26,423 --> 00:39:28,509
Have you been listening to me?

245
00:39:28,592 --> 00:39:33,556
- No, I think you should go.
- Will you shut up? What's wrong with you?

246
00:39:33,848 --> 00:39:38,644
You think this is a game? That I've come
to chat, to offer advice? To warn you?

247
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:41,856
Does it work, your video machine?

248
00:39:42,982 --> 00:39:44,692
- Put this in.
- I...

249
00:39:44,776 --> 00:39:46,986
I said put it in the machine.

250
00:39:54,703 --> 00:39:58,248
It belonged to Darby. He owed us money.

251
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:01,668
We thought it worthless, but not now.

252
00:40:04,588 --> 00:40:06,632
Now it has value.

253
00:40:07,258 --> 00:40:09,802
Now we are sure it has value.

254
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,851
- So play it.
- It's playing.

255
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:31,866
Like movies?

256
00:40:56,392 --> 00:41:00,938
- Please shut it off. Please.
- 40 minutes of a budding sexuality.

257
00:41:11,283 --> 00:41:16,121
$50,000 by tomorrow,
or there'll be a copy with the Tahoe police.

258
00:41:19,917 --> 00:41:22,669
Where do you expect me
to get $50,000 in 24 hours?

259
00:41:22,753 --> 00:41:26,966
- That's not our problem.
- And how do I knowthat's the only copy?

260
00:41:27,007 --> 00:41:29,844
You don't. That's the position you are in.

261
00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:33,139
Come up with the money, you own the tape.

262
00:41:37,351 --> 00:41:41,397
You don't want the police involved
any more than they are now.

263
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:55,287
Margaret! For the love of God, you must
talkto those cleaners about these stains.

264
00:41:55,328 --> 00:41:57,748
Oh, sorry. I didn't realise.

265
00:41:58,248 --> 00:42:01,376
- Jack Hall.
- Alek Spera.

266
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:04,505
Jack...

267
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:08,384
Mr Spera has helped Tom with some things.

268
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:11,053
Spera? From the air station?

269
00:42:16,642 --> 00:42:21,731
Please don't come back here. I'll meetyou
in town. Just not here, not around my family.

270
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:24,025
All right.

271
00:42:26,528 --> 00:42:29,406
- The post office?
- Yes, OK, that's fine.

272
00:42:30,365 --> 00:42:35,454
OK. Tomorrow, 5 o'clock.
And remember, Mrs Hall, $50,000.

273
00:42:35,537 --> 00:42:38,999
4.  4 o'clock. I have the kids.

274
00:42:41,043 --> 00:42:43,629
OK. 4 o'clock.

275
00:43:22,586 --> 00:43:24,755
Mom.

276
00:43:26,006 --> 00:43:29,218
I'm not going to practise today. I just can't.

277
00:43:30,678 --> 00:43:34,140
Could you call the school and let them know?

278
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,478
I don't wanna talkto anyone. Not now.

279
00:43:43,232 --> 00:43:47,737
Well, my husband is, as I explained to you,
in the navy, he's on a boat,

280
00:43:47,821 --> 00:43:50,949
he's somewhere in the middle
of the North Atlantic.

281
00:43:50,949 --> 00:43:55,412
It's just not possible for me
to get a signature from him.

282
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:00,375
Well, you cosigned the mortgage,

283
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,630
so you and your husband would both
have to sign on any future encumbrance.

284
00:44:04,755 --> 00:44:08,092
If it isn't possible to reach
your husband by fax, perhaps we...

285
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:11,053
I need the money tomorrow.

286
00:44:12,638 --> 00:44:14,974
I'm sorry.

287
00:44:26,861 --> 00:44:28,863
Hello!

288
00:44:46,757 --> 00:44:50,719
- Here you go.
- Thank you. You're the best.

289
00:45:10,532 --> 00:45:13,827
Yes. I'm sorry. Of course
I'm talking about a current balance.

290
00:45:13,869 --> 00:45:16,413
No, that's 30-155.

291
00:45:18,332 --> 00:45:28,384
Account number
48-74-39-20-11-79-22-91.

292
00:45:30,511 --> 00:45:33,139
No, I'm trying to determine my credit limit.

293
00:45:33,806 --> 00:45:36,183
The available credit, please.

294
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:41,064
37-83-54-96.

295
00:45:41,856 --> 00:45:44,150
No, no. 330-155...

296
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,736
Jack, I didn't know you... Can you hold on?

297
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,863
Your laundry, Jack.

298
00:45:48,863 --> 00:45:52,242
Damn tweezers. I thought I might
have my lunch early today.

299
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:53,910
I'll bring it up.

300
00:45:54,911 --> 00:45:57,873
Well, can we do it on the phone,
as an advance?

301
00:46:02,085 --> 00:46:04,505
All right. Goodbye.

302
00:47:13,535 --> 00:47:15,996
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- You OK, Beau?

303
00:47:15,996 --> 00:47:20,584
- Can we just start it again?
- Relax, kiddo. They're gonna love ya.

304
00:47:58,957 --> 00:48:02,085
Oh, my God! So ugly.

305
00:48:03,462 --> 00:48:05,798
No, I have to have it immediately. 00...

306
00:48:06,131 --> 00:48:10,052
Today. 197-734...

307
00:48:10,094 --> 00:48:13,347
I just wanna know how quickly
we can have the cash.

308
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:16,809
H-a-l-I. I'll hold.

309
00:48:17,018 --> 00:48:19,145
Yes. Hall.

310
00:48:19,812 --> 00:48:22,982
No, the cash, not credit.
Please don't transfer me...

311
00:48:22,982 --> 00:48:24,901
Please...

312
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,321
Can you say that again?

313
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:29,781
Thank you.

314
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:32,075
Hall. H-a-l-I.

315
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,036
No, I have to have it immediately.

316
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,621
Mine? November 5th 1960.

317
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:37,998
Margaret.

318
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,207
I can't reach him.

319
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,043
Account number 601...

320
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,127
3163.

321
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,670
I can't get a signature.

322
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,382
No. 0097...

323
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,175
56...

324
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:51,303
My mailing address is 7087 Lakeshore...

325
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:52,263
11...

326
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,598
Tahoe City, California.

327
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,143
961...

328
00:50:01,418 --> 00:50:02,669
No, don't bother calling back.

329
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:07,549
Because we won't need it at Christmas.
Thank you.

330
00:50:09,218 --> 00:50:12,805
Jack! Leave that for Beau.
He'll be home soon.

331
00:50:13,848 --> 00:50:17,018
Oh, don't be silly. It's just a bottle of water.

332
00:50:17,143 --> 00:50:19,645
Well, thanks.

333
00:50:19,645 --> 00:50:22,815
It's good for the back, I think.

334
00:50:23,191 --> 00:50:26,152
Jack, can I talk with you about something?

335
00:50:26,611 --> 00:50:28,613
Surely.

336
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:33,869
I have a problem.

337
00:50:39,249 --> 00:50:41,752
I need some money.

338
00:50:42,044 --> 00:50:46,173
- I knowthis is awkward.
- Don't be silly. How much?

339
00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:49,635
No. That isn't...

340
00:50:49,802 --> 00:50:52,054
Well?

341
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,515
The thing is...

342
00:50:56,017 --> 00:50:59,812
Well, come on, Maggie. Spit it out.
My back's tightening up.

343
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:07,445
The thing is I'm not really sure.
Why don't I go and check my purse again?

344
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:09,572
Here. Take...

345
00:51:11,074 --> 00:51:13,201
Take 80.

346
00:51:13,243 --> 00:51:16,663
And if you need any more, let me know.

347
00:51:18,707 --> 00:51:20,667
All right, Jack.

348
00:51:49,322 --> 00:51:51,658
This is the last one.

349
00:51:52,868 --> 00:51:55,078
Jack, I really don't think you should...

350
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:56,997
Jack?

351
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,333
Jack!

352
00:52:00,292 --> 00:52:02,544
Jack?

353
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:06,298
Jack! Jack!

354
00:52:06,507 --> 00:52:09,093
Can you hear me, Jack?

355
00:52:25,944 --> 00:52:29,406
- Do you wanna see my mom again?
- Yeah, I do.

356
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,285
Come in. Mom!

357
00:52:33,785 --> 00:52:36,663
2, 3, 4

358
00:52:40,542 --> 00:52:42,586
Dylan. Call 911.

359
00:52:46,507 --> 00:52:48,842
Go. Tell them we need an ambulance.

360
00:52:51,262 --> 00:52:55,725
2, 3, 4, 5

361
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:58,060
Jack!

362
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,521
Use more strength. Press harder.

363
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:04,025
Do you know howto do this?
Can you do this?

364
00:53:07,153 --> 00:53:10,407
Tilt his head back. One breath when I hit 5

365
00:53:10,907 --> 00:53:14,911
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

366
00:53:18,248 --> 00:53:22,669
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

367
00:53:25,798 --> 00:53:27,383
1, 2

368
00:53:27,383 --> 00:53:30,469
Mommy, they said they're coming,
5 minutes.

369
00:53:33,973 --> 00:53:38,644
Dylan, I need your help. Can you go upstairs
and get me a pillow? Dylan, please.

370
00:53:38,686 --> 00:53:40,730
5, go!

371
00:53:43,024 --> 00:53:47,320
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

372
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:55,746
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

373
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,749
Jack... Jack...

374
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:01,668
Jack, can you hear me? Jack...

375
00:54:05,756 --> 00:54:07,841
Margaret...

376
00:54:08,008 --> 00:54:10,136
Just lie still. Everything's fine.

377
00:54:14,307 --> 00:54:16,517
Everything's fine.

378
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:19,687
- Mom?
- It's OK, Dylan. Everything's fine.

379
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:23,837
Mom, are you there? Pick up if you're there.

380
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:28,300
Where are you?

381
00:55:28,342 --> 00:55:33,639
Well, I'm at Amber's. She needs a ride
to tomorrow night's ballet. I hope that's OK.

382
00:55:33,723 --> 00:55:36,225
And I'm gonna stay here for dinner. OK?

383
00:55:37,476 --> 00:55:39,562
All right. Bye.

384
00:57:13,451 --> 00:57:15,787
Hello?

385
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:18,665
- Where's my mother?
- She's...

386
00:57:20,626 --> 00:57:22,878
Your grandfather, he had a...

387
00:57:24,922 --> 00:57:27,424
You should call the hospital.

388
00:57:30,511 --> 00:57:32,805
Who are you?

389
00:57:32,805 --> 00:57:34,849
I'm...

390
00:57:35,683 --> 00:57:39,061
I know your father.
I'm a friend of your father's.

391
00:57:40,063 --> 00:57:42,148
And I was...

392
00:57:43,816 --> 00:57:45,068
leaving.

393
00:57:55,454 --> 00:57:58,123
I've been trying your cellphone all day.

394
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:02,085
Why haven't I heard from you?

395
00:58:03,587 --> 00:58:05,714
I had nothing to say.

396
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:08,551
Right.

397
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:15,891
You should've called. Where's the money?

398
00:58:17,768 --> 00:58:19,812
Why?

399
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:23,816
- I'll go back tomorrow.
- Why tomorrow? Why is tomorrow different?

400
00:58:23,816 --> 00:58:25,819
Because it is. I couldn't get it today.

401
00:58:25,985 --> 00:58:29,280
Of course you could.
You could, but you didn't.

402
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,410
- Look. I want that money.
- Yeah.

403
00:58:33,493 --> 00:58:36,496
And so do you. You do understand?

404
00:58:36,496 --> 00:58:39,374
- I said I'd take care of it.
- All right, fine.

405
00:58:39,499 --> 00:58:42,628
I trust you, Alek, like I trust myself.

406
00:58:42,795 --> 00:58:45,297
You say you're gonna get the money,
you get the money.

407
00:58:45,339 --> 00:58:49,426
But goddamn it, you'd better get
that son-of-a-bitch fuckin' money.

408
00:58:49,885 --> 00:58:53,597
This is a good piece of business
and I'm not gonna walk away from it.

409
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:57,185
I don't know what the fuck's
goin' on with you.

410
00:58:57,226 --> 00:59:00,563
All right. Tomorrow, Al, right?
I'm trustin' you.

411
00:59:00,813 --> 00:59:03,691
And if you can't carry through, I will.

412
00:59:17,914 --> 00:59:20,250
Yes, Jack Hall. I'm his daughter-in-law.

413
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,711
No, we just came from the hospital.

414
00:59:22,711 --> 00:59:25,714
He said sometime in the next 2 days.

415
00:59:42,565 --> 00:59:44,692
All right. Will someone call?

416
00:59:46,194 --> 00:59:48,488
Please, tonight. Thank you.

417
00:59:51,408 --> 00:59:53,410
Mom!

418
00:59:55,078 --> 00:59:57,998
- Did you talk with the hospital?
- Yes.

419
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,083
- How is he?
- I don't know.

420
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:03,921
I'll be right back. I have to
speak with someone outside.

421
01:00:29,781 --> 01:00:33,410
- I did mean to come yesterday.
- I waited almost an hour.

422
01:00:33,493 --> 01:00:36,329
- I'm sorry about that.
- You were not coming, Mrs Hall.

423
01:00:36,371 --> 01:00:40,250
- You were here, you saw what happened.
- You were not coming!

424
01:00:42,211 --> 01:00:44,505
- Did you get the money?
- No.

425
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:49,510
- I'm not sure you understand.
- We don't have the money.

426
01:00:49,552 --> 01:00:52,930
You have to get the money.
Is that not clear enough?

427
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:57,685
It's $50,000. It is not the kind of thing
that everyone can just go out and get.

428
01:00:57,768 --> 01:01:01,814
- Have you spoken with your husband?
- He can't be reached. He's on a carrier...

429
01:01:03,399 --> 01:01:06,319
This is truly none of your business.

430
01:01:06,361 --> 01:01:09,572
What about the old man?

431
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,286
Well, you have to try harder.

432
01:01:14,953 --> 01:01:18,624
- Try harder?
- I don't think you're really trying.

433
01:01:18,707 --> 01:01:20,208
- Really?
- Yes.

434
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:24,129
Well, maybe you should explain
"really trying" to me, Mr Spera.

435
01:01:24,129 --> 01:01:27,925
Tell me. How would you be
"really trying" if you were me?

436
01:01:29,301 --> 01:01:31,178
Butyou're not me, are you?

437
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:35,600
You don't have my petty concerns
to clutter your life and keep you from trying.

438
01:01:35,766 --> 01:01:38,144
You don't have 3 kids to feed,

439
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:41,689
or... worry about the future
of a 17-year-old boy,

440
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:46,319
who nearly got himself killed
driving back from some kind of a nightclub

441
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:50,699
with his 30-year-old friend
sitting drunk in the seat beside him.

442
01:01:50,699 --> 01:01:53,952
No, these are notyour concerns. I see that.

443
01:01:57,247 --> 01:02:02,169
But perhaps you're right, Mr Spera.
Perhaps I could be trying a little harder.

444
01:02:02,836 --> 01:02:06,507
Maybe sometime tomorrow, between
dropping Dylan at baseball practice

445
01:02:06,632 --> 01:02:10,010
and picking up my father-in-law
from the hospital,

446
01:02:10,302 --> 01:02:12,972
I might find a way to try a little harder.

447
01:02:15,391 --> 01:02:18,227
Maybe I should take a page from your book.

448
01:02:19,729 --> 01:02:22,398
Go to the track,

449
01:02:22,565 --> 01:02:24,776
find a card game...

450
01:02:26,444 --> 01:02:29,155
Maybe I should blackmail someone.

451
01:02:32,534 --> 01:02:34,661
Or maybe you have another idea.

452
01:02:35,954 --> 01:02:40,626
I mean, maybe you have a better idea
of how I might try a little harder

453
01:02:40,792 --> 01:02:44,630
to find this $50,000
you have come here to steal from me.

454
01:02:50,427 --> 01:02:53,055
You're right. I'm notyou.

455
01:02:54,515 --> 01:02:56,601
I don't...

456
01:03:01,606 --> 01:03:04,776
This is only a business opportunity.
That's all.

457
01:03:05,485 --> 01:03:08,363
What kind of a heartless man are you?

458
01:03:14,369 --> 01:03:17,581
Do you ever get away
from your family, Mrs Hall?

459
01:03:28,092 --> 01:03:31,387
I'll talk to Nagle about the time.

460
01:03:32,304 --> 01:03:34,765
- Maybe he will listen.
- Mom!

461
01:03:37,185 --> 01:03:40,188
I'm sorry. You don't know
what kind of a man Nagle is.

462
01:03:40,313 --> 01:03:42,190
Please go. Leave my family out of this.

463
01:03:42,315 --> 01:03:47,278
- It's getting late. Paige needs to go.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

464
01:03:47,278 --> 01:03:49,447
- Is everything OK?
- Yes.

465
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:01,564
- I'll get it.
- Dylan! Mom...

466
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:05,652
Hall residence. Dylan speaking.

467
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,906
One minute, please. It's for you.

468
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,076
Mr Spiro?

469
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:19,958
I'll take it upstairs.

470
01:05:26,382 --> 01:05:28,551
OK, Dylan. Hang up, please.

471
01:05:35,474 --> 01:05:39,145
- Why are you calling me here?
- I need to speak with you.

472
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:41,230
I'm sorry. Please listen.

473
01:05:41,939 --> 01:05:46,653
You only need to raise 25,000.
I told Nagle I won't take my share.

474
01:05:47,612 --> 01:05:50,240
I don't want it now.

475
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:54,578
If I could make him go away,
stop bothering you, I would.

476
01:05:55,579 --> 01:06:00,292
I wish I could go back, but I can't.

477
01:06:02,961 --> 01:06:08,259
He wants that money and he'll make things
ugly for you if he doesn't get it, I promise.

478
01:06:10,344 --> 01:06:12,888
Do you hear me? It's not so much now.

479
01:06:12,888 --> 01:06:17,393
- Why are you doing this?
- Please just do as I say. Just get the money.

480
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,814
Are you there?

481
01:06:21,898 --> 01:06:24,692
- Do you understand?
- Yes. I think so.

482
01:06:25,401 --> 01:06:28,530
Meet me in Reno tomorrow, 3 o'clock.

483
01:06:29,197 --> 01:06:32,242
- Harrah's, outside.
- All right.

484
01:06:32,826 --> 01:06:36,288
- Can you find it? Harrah's Casino?
- Yes.

485
01:06:36,538 --> 01:06:39,124
Tomorrow. It's not much time, I know.

486
01:06:40,876 --> 01:06:42,878
No.

487
01:06:58,436 --> 01:07:02,815
- If you keep giving it gas, you'll flood it.
- Paige, can you do something?

488
01:07:02,982 --> 01:07:05,401
Where are you going?

489
01:07:08,947 --> 01:07:12,284
- The car, sweetheart. I'm late.
- OK. Pop it.

490
01:07:16,371 --> 01:07:20,042
- Problem?
- It's nothing. My daughter'll fix it.

491
01:07:20,709 --> 01:07:23,670
Make somebody a great husband someday.

492
01:07:24,755 --> 01:07:27,049
- Can I help you?
- Hope so.

493
01:07:27,174 --> 01:07:31,011
Talkin' to the residents about the murder
at Buck's Cove. You heard about that?

494
01:07:31,262 --> 01:07:33,889
- OK, try it, and don't...
- I know.

495
01:07:36,017 --> 01:07:37,810
OK!

496
01:07:37,935 --> 01:07:40,063
Yes, we heard about it.

497
01:07:40,188 --> 01:07:43,900
Seems the victim was killed
with an anchor. Pierced his lungs.

498
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:48,696
We were thinkin' maybe that anchor could've
come from one of these houses around here.

499
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:53,410
Well, our dinghy doesn't have an anchor.
We tie it to the dock.

500
01:07:53,493 --> 01:07:56,204
- Always?
- Yes.

501
01:07:56,288 --> 01:07:58,707
All right. Like I said, just checkin'.

502
01:07:59,499 --> 01:08:02,461
If you think of anything, give us a call.

503
01:08:02,461 --> 01:08:04,546
OK.

504
01:08:10,427 --> 01:08:13,013
I'm stumped. What did he want?

505
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:16,559
- You can't fix it?
- I don't know.

506
01:08:18,352 --> 01:08:22,190
No, I guess not. You probably
clogged the fuel lines.

507
01:08:22,649 --> 01:08:25,610
- You know, Beau's car...
- I'll call a taxi.

508
01:08:27,278 --> 01:08:31,491
- Where are you going, anyway?
- Some errands. I'll be back before dinner.

509
01:08:31,616 --> 01:08:35,454
- Well, how am I supposed to get to ballet?
- Sue's stopping by.

510
01:08:40,876 --> 01:08:43,045
7087 Lakeshore Court.

511
01:08:44,046 --> 01:08:46,131
Tahoe City.

512
01:08:48,467 --> 01:08:51,345
Yes. I'll wait outside. Thank you.

513
01:08:54,056 --> 01:08:56,559
You look nice. What's going on?

514
01:08:56,559 --> 01:08:59,020
Nothing. Just some errands in town.

515
01:08:59,937 --> 01:09:04,192
- You're taking a taxi?
- Yeah, the Jeep won't start.

516
01:09:04,234 --> 01:09:06,194
I could drive you.

517
01:09:07,237 --> 01:09:09,698
No, I'd prefer to be alone.

518
01:10:02,336 --> 01:10:05,089
You sure you wanna hock this stuff?.

519
01:10:05,756 --> 01:10:09,718
- Yes. How much do you think?
- I could go to 8500.

520
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,430
Maybe 8600.

521
01:10:16,225 --> 01:10:19,645
Well, I was hoping
that you could give me more.

522
01:10:19,812 --> 01:10:22,315
8600 is more.

523
01:10:40,459 --> 01:10:42,586
Margaret, stop!

524
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:47,633
- Where's your car?
- It wouldn't start.

525
01:10:47,758 --> 01:10:52,346
I don't have all the money. I could
only raise 12,000. A little more than 12.

526
01:10:52,388 --> 01:10:54,849
Here. Please say it's enough.

527
01:10:57,059 --> 01:11:01,606
- I need to talk to you. Just for a minute.
- Jack's waiting to be picked up. I'm late.

528
01:11:01,606 --> 01:11:04,108
- I'll drive you back to Tahoe.
- No, thank you.

529
01:11:04,359 --> 01:11:08,488
- Would you help me find a cab?
- I need to talk to you, please.

530
01:11:08,571 --> 01:11:10,657
Things have changed.

531
01:11:18,373 --> 01:11:20,751
The seat belt is above the door.

532
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:40,062
- The hospital, not the house?
- Yes.

533
01:11:42,607 --> 01:11:45,193
No, thank you.

534
01:11:45,235 --> 01:11:47,904
I took you for a smoker.

535
01:11:54,995 --> 01:11:58,832
They arrested someone for Darby's murder.

536
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:01,919
- That's impossible.
- It's more than possible.

537
01:12:02,044 --> 01:12:04,421
- Who is it?
- It doesn't matter.

538
01:12:04,463 --> 01:12:06,757
Who is it?

539
01:12:06,757 --> 01:12:09,510
His name is Donnelly. Martin Donnelly.

540
01:12:09,635 --> 01:12:12,596
- He didn't do it.
- Like I said, it doesn't matter.

541
01:12:12,596 --> 01:12:17,894
Nagle's lost the advantage, but he'll make
a deal with you. He'll wanna make a deal.

542
01:12:17,977 --> 01:12:20,730
Donnelly didn't kill Darby.

543
01:12:20,813 --> 01:12:22,065
- What?
- I know that.

544
01:12:22,065 --> 01:12:24,275
- You don't.
- I do.

545
01:12:24,317 --> 01:12:25,944
- How?
- It's not important.

546
01:12:25,944 --> 01:12:27,112
How?

547
01:12:38,415 --> 01:12:40,375
Darby...

548
01:12:41,668 --> 01:12:44,421
Darby came to our house
that night to see Beau.

549
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:52,430
I had gone to his nightclub earlier in the day.

550
01:12:53,431 --> 01:12:57,518
Beau had been in a car accident.
He'd been drinking with Darby.

551
01:13:00,855 --> 01:13:03,942
You see... My husband...

552
01:13:05,777 --> 01:13:08,988
He won't understand as it is, his son being...

553
01:13:12,033 --> 01:13:14,870
I don't know howto talk to him about it.

554
01:13:16,371 --> 01:13:18,749
He's away at sea so often.

555
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:22,544
It's not that...

556
01:13:27,424 --> 01:13:29,927
I must sound very silly to you.

557
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:37,018
I just wanted him to stay away from Beau.

558
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:41,564
But I failed.

559
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:45,318
He came to the house that night.

560
01:13:45,485 --> 01:13:48,530
They fought in the boathouse.
I don't know why.

561
01:13:49,197 --> 01:13:52,993
I heard these noises and I came down.
Beau had run back in.

562
01:13:54,244 --> 01:13:56,163
I met Darby on the dock.

563
01:13:57,039 --> 01:14:01,210
We argued. I pushed him
and he fell through the railing.

564
01:14:01,335 --> 01:14:03,670
- You pushed him?
- Yes.

565
01:14:04,505 --> 01:14:05,297
And?

566
01:14:05,297 --> 01:14:09,385
The railing just gave way,
and he fell onto the anchor.

567
01:14:11,971 --> 01:14:14,890
- And I moved the body.
- You?

568
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:17,101
Yes. In the boat, in the morning.

569
01:14:17,143 --> 01:14:19,729
- Alone?
- Of course alone.

570
01:14:19,937 --> 01:14:21,230
I don't believe you.

571
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:25,318
I don't care what you believe.
It is what happened.

572
01:14:25,318 --> 01:14:28,571
- And I have to tell them.
- Tell them what?

573
01:14:28,571 --> 01:14:31,700
- That you killed a man?
- Yes.

574
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:37,622
This is crazy. Whatever happened that night
is over. Done. It can't be undone.

575
01:14:37,831 --> 01:14:43,045
Not undone, but I can put an end to this,
to Nagle's threats, to all of this!

576
01:14:43,128 --> 01:14:45,798
Stop it! Just stop it!

577
01:14:50,261 --> 01:14:54,598
It's too late for that.
Whatever happened, it's too late.

578
01:14:58,895 --> 01:15:02,065
Listen to me. You have
your family to think about.

579
01:15:03,066 --> 01:15:05,652
The life of your family, not Donnelly.

580
01:15:06,528 --> 01:15:11,825
Forget all of this. Forget Donnelly,
forget Nagle and me.

581
01:15:12,534 --> 01:15:17,039
Go home. Put all this behind you
as if it never happened.

582
01:15:19,499 --> 01:15:22,044
Do you hear me, Margaret?

583
01:15:26,382 --> 01:15:28,592
Margaret...

584
01:15:41,272 --> 01:15:45,068
You've reached the Halls. Leave us your name
and number and we'll get back to you.

585
01:15:45,276 --> 01:15:47,529
Thanks for calling.

586
01:15:47,529 --> 01:15:51,866
Hi, it's Mom. I'm running late.
If the hospital calls, just...

587
01:15:53,743 --> 01:15:56,872
Never mind. I'll be home soon.

588
01:16:23,441 --> 01:16:27,987
Hi. I got a call that my grandfather
was waiting to be picked up.

589
01:16:28,571 --> 01:16:30,490
- Name?
- Jack Hall.

590
01:16:30,699 --> 01:16:33,827
My mother was supposed to
come and get him. Is he...?

591
01:16:35,745 --> 01:16:37,664
Great. Thanks.

592
01:16:37,706 --> 01:16:41,210
- Sure you don't wanna keep the wheelchair?
- Don't be ridiculous.

593
01:16:41,293 --> 01:16:44,171
It's bad enough they saddle me with this.

594
01:16:45,547 --> 01:16:48,050
This thing's a wreck.

595
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:51,595
Can I take your cane? I can put it in the back.

596
01:16:51,595 --> 01:16:53,764
No.

597
01:17:11,157 --> 01:17:14,202
- How will you get home?
- I'll get a taxi.

598
01:17:34,974 --> 01:17:38,394
You know, I never thanked you
for your help with Jack.

599
01:17:39,228 --> 01:17:41,814
I was there, that's all.

600
01:17:41,939 --> 01:17:44,400
His heart had stopped.

601
01:17:45,902 --> 01:17:48,238
It happens.

602
01:18:17,894 --> 01:18:19,604
Nagle. It's Alek.

603
01:18:20,188 --> 01:18:26,236
I don't know. Columbia sent back my tapes,
and Wesleyan just asked for another one.

604
01:18:26,236 --> 01:18:29,280
- What about Annapolis?
- I didn't apply to Annapolis.

605
01:18:29,447 --> 01:18:32,242
Shame. It's a fine school.

606
01:18:33,493 --> 01:18:34,786
Just lie down.

607
01:18:36,329 --> 01:18:39,124
I think he was in 313.

608
01:18:39,207 --> 01:18:43,212
- You already told me that.
- Well, he can't have disappeared.

609
01:18:43,378 --> 01:18:45,756
Take a breath.

610
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:48,300
He was checked out to a Beau Hall.

611
01:18:55,099 --> 01:18:57,560
It's time to stop this, that's all.

612
01:18:58,394 --> 01:19:00,813
She came up with 12. There is no more.

613
01:19:01,773 --> 01:19:05,735
No. The husband's on a boat somewhere.
It won't happen for him.

614
01:19:05,777 --> 01:19:08,321
We got what we could. Let it go now.

615
01:19:12,909 --> 01:19:15,245
Battleships.

616
01:19:15,370 --> 01:19:17,456
I never liked carriers.

617
01:19:17,497 --> 01:19:21,877
Who was the guy who used to give us
those helicopter rides, in Virginia?

618
01:19:22,085 --> 01:19:26,840
- No one ever gave you helicopter rides.
- Don't you remember? The tall guy?

619
01:19:27,758 --> 01:19:30,386
- That's hogwash.
- I'll be right back.

620
01:19:31,262 --> 01:19:34,890
And no helo rides. Not on my watch.

621
01:19:35,808 --> 01:19:38,644
So explain it to me again. Maybe I'm stupid.

622
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:42,357
I already told you.
Donnelly will be out by tomorrow,

623
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,525
in which case we have what we had all along.

624
01:19:44,901 --> 01:19:47,779
You got most of what you wanted.
It's over. It's enough.

625
01:19:47,862 --> 01:19:50,991
I don't want "most". I want "all".

626
01:19:51,116 --> 01:19:54,578
Why is it so hard for you to understand that?

627
01:19:54,578 --> 01:19:57,122
I'm warning you, Carlie. Don't be greedy.

628
01:19:57,122 --> 01:20:02,085
It's not your place to warn me.
You should know that. It's not your place!

629
01:20:02,836 --> 01:20:07,508
Jesus. What the hell is she doing
in a taxi in Tahoe?

630
01:20:09,176 --> 01:20:11,762
I asked you to handle this. You did not.

631
01:20:11,762 --> 01:20:16,183
I don't know why, I'm confused.
But I'm gonna do this now.

632
01:20:38,957 --> 01:20:42,127
- Who are you?
- I think you know my partner.

633
01:20:42,252 --> 01:20:44,755
Please go. I can't talkto you, not here.

634
01:20:44,797 --> 01:20:47,257
You'll talkto me.

635
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,162
- What do you want?
- Just the money. I just want the money.

636
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,999
- I gave it to Alek.
- Part. You gave him part. I don't want part.

637
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:22,294
- He said that Donnelly...
- He didn't kill Darby. It's idiotic.

638
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:26,382
- The police will know soon enough.
- Just get out of my house.

639
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:33,556
This is the problem
and I would like to resolve it now.

640
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:36,309
I'll try and be clear.

641
01:21:36,559 --> 01:21:39,812
I think you've lied to Al.
I think you've put ideas in his head.

642
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:41,898
I think you have the money.

643
01:21:41,898 --> 01:21:46,736
I think you haven't been altogether
straight forward with us...

644
01:21:49,489 --> 01:21:51,825
if you wanna know the truth.

645
01:21:53,994 --> 01:21:56,371
What kind of a fool do you think I am?

646
01:21:58,165 --> 01:22:01,710
- Would I risk anything if I had the money?
- Maybe.

647
01:22:02,586 --> 01:22:04,505
Where's your husband?

648
01:22:04,713 --> 01:22:08,259
I'd like to talk with him, because
I don't want this going on any longer.

649
01:22:08,425 --> 01:22:11,971
I can't seem to get any kind of
straight answer from you.

650
01:22:13,389 --> 01:22:15,683
Carlie.

651
01:22:17,435 --> 01:22:20,062
Alek, go away.

652
01:22:20,188 --> 01:22:22,774
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

653
01:22:24,067 --> 01:22:28,154
- I told you not to come here.
- That was not your right.

654
01:22:28,154 --> 01:22:30,448
- You lost control.
- That's not important.

655
01:22:30,448 --> 01:22:34,119
Al, please. Please go. Go away.

656
01:22:34,202 --> 01:22:37,330
- This woman's made a fool of you.
- Think what you want.

657
01:22:37,330 --> 01:22:40,417
A stupid, stupid fool. A weakling.

658
01:22:40,459 --> 01:22:43,378
- You've behaved like a stupid weakling.
- Shut up.

659
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:47,424
Are you fucking her? Is that what's going on?
Is that it? You're fucking her?

660
01:22:47,508 --> 01:22:50,511
- I said shut up.
- Don't talk to me that way.

661
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,060
Get out of here.

662
01:22:58,060 --> 01:23:00,855
- Don't push this, Al.
- Get out!

663
01:23:27,675 --> 01:23:29,844
Alek.

664
01:23:35,433 --> 01:23:38,352
Alek, I...

665
01:24:05,881 --> 01:24:07,675
Alek...

666
01:24:07,675 --> 01:24:09,969
Be quiet.

667
01:24:10,052 --> 01:24:12,138
Please, I beg you, don't.

668
01:24:50,928 --> 01:24:53,389
I'll go to the police.

669
01:24:55,224 --> 01:25:00,313
I'll tell them about Darby. I'll tell them
you killed Nagle in self-defence.

670
01:25:03,524 --> 01:25:06,069
I'll go to the police, Alek.

671
01:25:06,194 --> 01:25:08,363
I'm sorry.

672
01:25:11,157 --> 01:25:13,827
It shouldn't have come to this.

673
01:25:23,837 --> 01:25:25,923
Alek, Alek...

674
01:25:25,923 --> 01:25:27,925
Alek...

675
01:25:31,178 --> 01:25:33,806
We have no choice now.

676
01:25:37,059 --> 01:25:40,062
Please... You gotta let me tell 'em.

677
01:25:42,774 --> 01:25:44,651
Please.

678
01:26:17,101 --> 01:26:19,562
Listen to me. Go inside.

679
01:26:20,313 --> 01:26:23,566
No one can be near the windows.
Think of something, anything.

680
01:26:23,733 --> 01:26:26,152
Just keep your family away.

681
01:26:26,194 --> 01:26:31,866
Meet me in the driveway. We'll go together.
Take my car keys. In my coat, on the right.

682
01:26:32,784 --> 01:26:35,328
I'll drive Nagle's car. You follow in mine.

683
01:26:35,537 --> 01:26:39,166
Butyou must go inside.
I'll wait in the driveway.

684
01:26:40,792 --> 01:26:43,337
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

685
01:27:36,183 --> 01:27:38,352
No.

686
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:40,646
No...

687
01:27:56,288 --> 01:27:57,456
Mom?

688
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:05,047
What's going on?

689
01:28:09,844 --> 01:28:13,889
- Your lip! Jesus...
- Beau, I need you to help me.

690
01:28:14,015 --> 01:28:18,227
- Where are you going?
- I can't drive this. The shift...

691
01:28:18,895 --> 01:28:22,315
- I need you to drive the car. Please.
- Mom...

692
01:28:22,482 --> 01:28:25,818
Please. We need to leave now.
Can you help me?

693
01:28:25,944 --> 01:28:28,321
Just... Please, just help me.

694
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:45,005
It's a grey car. Did you see it in the driveway?

695
01:28:45,089 --> 01:28:46,924
No.

696
01:28:51,595 --> 01:28:53,973
There. Is that it?

697
01:29:08,488 --> 01:29:11,866
He shouldn't have left like that.
He should have waited.

698
01:29:19,416 --> 01:29:23,170
- It's not what you think.
- How do you know what I think?

699
01:29:23,921 --> 01:29:26,340
- He's a friend.
- Yeah.

700
01:29:29,885 --> 01:29:32,471
That's all. He's just a friend.

701
01:29:40,062 --> 01:29:42,607
Did you see that?

702
01:30:06,131 --> 01:30:08,801
Beau, Beau! Please, call for help.

703
01:30:13,639 --> 01:30:17,143
- Alek! Alek!
- You shouldn't have followed me.

704
01:30:17,143 --> 01:30:21,064
- Jesus! Jesus!
- Why did you follow me?

705
01:30:21,189 --> 01:30:23,691
You didn't wait. Why didn'tyou wait?

706
01:30:23,691 --> 01:30:28,196
I lost control of the car, Margaret. My arm.

707
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:31,449
Margaret, stop. Stop!

708
01:30:34,452 --> 01:30:36,621
Margaret, stop.

709
01:30:37,456 --> 01:30:39,583
Stop!

710
01:30:41,752 --> 01:30:45,130
- I'm gonna get you out of here.
- No, no!

711
01:30:45,255 --> 01:30:47,508
Just leave.

712
01:30:47,591 --> 01:30:51,220
- Someone will come.
- Oh, Alek.

713
01:30:51,887 --> 01:30:55,224
They'll think he died here in the crash.

714
01:30:55,391 --> 01:30:58,477
- Please go.
- I can't leave you.

715
01:30:59,937 --> 01:31:03,232
Butyou must.
They can't find you here. Think!

716
01:31:04,734 --> 01:31:06,778
Please, no.

717
01:31:08,196 --> 01:31:13,076
Margaret, the tape and the money.

718
01:31:13,827 --> 01:31:16,580
Look for them.

719
01:31:16,621 --> 01:31:19,333
They were on the seat. Can you see them?

720
01:31:21,126 --> 01:31:23,462
Get them out.

721
01:31:35,725 --> 01:31:38,644
- I can't see where...
- Just try.

722
01:31:52,826 --> 01:31:55,370
- Now go.
- No, Alek.

723
01:32:01,543 --> 01:32:03,629
I can't.

724
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:06,882
Please go.

725
01:32:18,769 --> 01:32:21,272
I'm sorry, Margaret.

726
01:32:22,565 --> 01:32:25,026
I'm sorry for all of this.

727
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:36,079
Margaret...

728
01:32:38,999 --> 01:32:41,168
Yes?

729
01:32:43,629 --> 01:32:45,923
I think...

730
01:32:49,301 --> 01:32:51,470
I'm not...

731
01:33:00,396 --> 01:33:02,357
Alek...

732
01:34:52,596 --> 01:34:54,890
Mom?

733
01:35:09,364 --> 01:35:11,908
Do you want me to call somebody?

734
01:35:22,586 --> 01:35:24,755
No.

735
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:34,724
Can you just be here with me?

736
01:35:34,724 --> 01:35:37,393
All right.

737
01:35:37,518 --> 01:35:39,270
I'm here.

738
01:36:07,132 --> 01:36:08,968
I don't know how...

739
01:36:11,804 --> 01:36:14,765
I don't know what to say.

740
01:36:14,765 --> 01:36:16,893
So don't.

741
01:36:18,769 --> 01:36:21,355
I don't need to know.

742
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:24,859
It's not important.

743
01:36:29,489 --> 01:36:31,992
I love you, Beau.

744
01:36:36,538 --> 01:36:38,707
Yeah.

745
01:36:39,958 --> 01:36:42,336
Me, too.

746
01:37:37,184 --> 01:37:40,062
Mom, it's Dad. Can you pick up?

747
01:37:41,305 --> 01:37:47,360
