2
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:05,991
Hey!

3
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:39,035
That was okay.

4
00:03:51,686 --> 00:03:53,355
It's Kathryn Vale.

5
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:56,259
Cool.

6
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:16,118
It's quite an entrance.

7
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,052
Hi!

8
00:04:17,054 --> 00:04:20,257
You look so sweet.

9
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,525
Did you see that?

10
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:26,031
I have like a little
area, so let's go.

11
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:41,051
Is this really
the best they can do?

12
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:43,721
I wish you could
be more excited.

13
00:04:43,723 --> 00:04:45,624
I came to see you, didn't I?

14
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:51,598
See me or be seen?

15
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,369
I was watching the monitor.

16
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:59,542
You're not making
enough for your face.

17
00:04:59,544 --> 00:05:01,011
What do you mean?

18
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:10,490
Hello? How are you?

19
00:05:10,492 --> 00:05:14,595
Did you get it?

20
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:18,300
Great. I'll call you back.

21
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,574
I got an audition for
the new De Palma.

22
00:05:23,576 --> 00:05:25,075
Really?

23
00:05:25,077 --> 00:05:28,881
Will Bryan be there?

24
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:31,752
No. But the casting
director will send in the tape.

25
00:05:31,754 --> 00:05:35,390
Oh, that rather
depends on you, doesn't it?

26
00:05:35,392 --> 00:05:38,060
I'll keep my fingers crossed.

27
00:05:44,604 --> 00:05:45,603
I brought you something.

28
00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:48,940
What is it?

29
00:05:48,942 --> 00:05:52,078
For the movie, for good luck.

30
00:05:57,587 --> 00:06:01,557
I love it.

31
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:04,561
I love it.

32
00:06:04,563 --> 00:06:06,564
Oh, is it time?

33
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,166
Can't you stay
for the next set up?

34
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,868
This is my big scene.

35
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,575
Oh. We should get back.

36
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:17,437
She's right.
I got a million things to do.

37
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,707
But you'll be great.

38
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,023
Bye.

39
00:06:25,172 --> 00:06:26,770
Let's go.

40
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,476
Welcome back.

41
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:41,844
In her youth, she posses one

42
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:44,681
of the most photographed
faces in the world.

43
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:48,787
In the passing years, her
beauty has grown more fragile,

44
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:51,757
more arresting.

45
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,063
I'm honored to say my guest
today is the internationally

46
00:06:56,065 --> 00:07:02,171
renowned star of stage
and screen, Kathryn Vale.

47
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:05,475
I couldn't put it down.

48
00:07:05,477 --> 00:07:09,447
This is a gripping, brutally
honest account of everything

49
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:13,786
from your impoverished childhood
in Europe to your success

50
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:16,390
in Hollywood, to your marriage

51
00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:20,996
to the late industrialist
Maximilian Pierce.

52
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:22,598
At the time, there
was some speculation

53
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,702
that you were involved
in his death.

54
00:07:25,704 --> 00:07:30,808
Max's killer has
never been found.

55
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,213
In the book, you suggest the
allegations cost you the Academy

56
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:37,617
Award for Afflicted
which was your last film.

57
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:41,623
Now, that was almost
10 years ago.

58
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,026
What got you back on your feet?

59
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:46,095
Time a good healer?

60
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:50,234
Yeah. And love.

61
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,071
Are you referring to Jake?

62
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:57,244
Jake Kelly, he wrote the
screenplay for Crazy Love,

63
00:07:57,246 --> 00:08:00,181
which was a big hit
a few years ago.

64
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:07,591
And the two of you have been
married nearly three months?

65
00:08:07,593 --> 00:08:11,128
Now tell me, does this
book signal a return

66
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,598
to public life?

67
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,604
Will you go back to acting?

68
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:22,577
And I'm very proud of her.

69
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,601
Do you have the diamonds?

70
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,103
I have them right here.

71
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:48,511
Okay guys, let's cut it.

72
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:50,381
Hey!

73
00:08:53,586 --> 00:08:54,419
Did you like that?

74
00:08:54,421 --> 00:08:57,423
I just... this
big gun to me.

75
00:08:57,425 --> 00:08:58,558
Well, I feel I
really hokey you

76
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,526
with the gun in my left hand.

77
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:00,494
This is really big.

78
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:01,496
It's truly big.

79
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:04,165
But I like the acting.

80
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:06,068
Yeah, let's go again.

81
00:09:13,646 --> 00:09:15,047
Go on! Cut!

82
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:26,996
Go on. Cut!

83
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:29,533
Ted, that was the
last take, right?

84
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:32,470
No, I can... give
me one more chance.

85
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:33,338
I can nail it.

86
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,372
What was wrong with it?

87
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:39,679
What... we'll just... we'll cut
around it, but what's next?

88
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:42,149
Over these mics, we
better get the lakefront

89
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:43,417
scene.

90
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:45,120
Moving on.

91
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,133
To Zoe.

92
00:10:03,178 --> 00:10:05,079
Break a leg.

93
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:06,749
Love mom.

94
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:15,827
You die. You die.

95
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:17,896
You die.

96
00:10:17,898 --> 00:10:20,333
You died in my arms.

97
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:26,074
It was dark, I was driving.

98
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:29,845
It was dark, I was driving,

99
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:32,716
and then he put his
hands into my legs

100
00:10:32,718 --> 00:10:34,185
and I took the steering wheel.

101
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:25,185
I forgot, this came for you.

102
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,855
Yes?

103
00:12:17,857 --> 00:12:19,224
I didn't wake you, did I?

104
00:12:19,226 --> 00:12:22,628
I want you to call
Humphrey's office tomorrow.

105
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,700
I need to see him first thing.

106
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:58,508
I really have to play this part.

107
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,744
It's a good part for you.

108
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,446
It's a great part.

109
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:05,518
Yes. But there'll
be lots of publicity.

110
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,923
The press is bound to
dig it all up again.

111
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:12,361
They won't.

112
00:13:12,363 --> 00:13:14,129
That's why I wrote the book.

113
00:13:14,131 --> 00:13:15,932
I gave them what they wanted.

114
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:17,935
How do you think
Zoe will react?

115
00:13:17,937 --> 00:13:24,243
I went to visit her on
the set the other day and

116
00:13:24,245 --> 00:13:27,781
I felt I'm ready
to do this again.

117
00:13:27,783 --> 00:13:31,386
I'm probably better
now than I ever was.

118
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:36,325
Ha! You never
cease to amaze me.

119
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:37,794
I'll let them know.

120
00:13:37,796 --> 00:13:39,764
I want the deal
made by Friday.

121
00:13:39,766 --> 00:13:42,233
Now is a perfect time.

122
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,714
Just give me a
couple of weeks.

123
00:13:52,716 --> 00:13:56,252
Yeah, I know what I said.

124
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:58,088
I know that.

125
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,090
I know it's a lot of cash.

126
00:14:00,092 --> 00:14:05,197
Yeah. No, I didn't... let me
call you back, all right?

127
00:14:26,793 --> 00:14:29,730
Yeah, we need to call
Sally to do my hair.

128
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:33,034
No, I need to fly out
early to do work and stuff.

129
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:34,135
Uh-hmm.

130
00:14:34,137 --> 00:14:36,004
I guess a house in Malibu.

131
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:37,005
Ha!

132
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:39,909
Yeah. I'm excited.

133
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:41,245
Good.

134
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,814
You're excited
too, aren't you?

135
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,251
Of course.

136
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,187
Oh good.

137
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:51,425
Okay, bye.

138
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:56,598
It won't keep him, you know?

139
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,567
This has nothing
to do with Jake.

140
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:02,139
It was a mistake to
quit in the first place.

141
00:15:02,141 --> 00:15:05,510
You didn't have a choice.

142
00:15:10,985 --> 00:15:12,051
Do you think you have
it all wrapped up?

143
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:14,221
Just call Sally and shut up.

144
00:15:51,272 --> 00:15:53,240
So tell me what you heard.

145
00:15:53,242 --> 00:15:56,945
I told you, she's
got the lead in a film.

146
00:15:56,947 --> 00:15:59,048
She wouldn't do that.

147
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,316
You've got it wrong.

148
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:01,483
I know what I heard.

149
00:16:01,485 --> 00:16:03,220
She's making a comeback.

150
00:16:14,903 --> 00:16:16,637
It's been a long time.

151
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:23,747
We used to here
every weekend, I remember.

152
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:28,353
I told you, it's perfect.

153
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:29,989
Hey, darling.

154
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:33,093
You look beautiful.

155
00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:38,734
I prefer the other dress.

156
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:42,906
I told you, it's
two against one.

157
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:44,407
What's wrong with it?

158
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:48,313
Maybe it's just not
right for this evening.

159
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:53,452
I'll wear the first one.

160
00:16:53,454 --> 00:16:55,188
This makes me nervous.

161
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,059
Oh, Jake, don't.

162
00:16:58,061 --> 00:17:01,330
He's always hanging
around listening.

163
00:17:01,332 --> 00:17:02,898
We're going to get rid of her.

164
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,238
Are you ready?

165
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:19,854
Laurence, I'm sorry
to get you here so early.

166
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:25,429
Do you have the papers?

167
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:28,199
Why don't we slip
away and do it right now?

168
00:17:28,201 --> 00:17:31,270
It won't take long, will it?

169
00:17:40,316 --> 00:17:43,285
It's not too late
to change your mind.

170
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:07,283
Now, one together.

171
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:10,087
You do look like
a million bucks.

172
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,359
Now, one with your daughter.

173
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,829
Great. You guys are good.

174
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:21,803
I meant to tell you guys,
how the interview with Joan.

175
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:23,873
It was a wonderful
performance.

176
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:29,212
Hi.

177
00:18:29,214 --> 00:18:30,081
Hi, Jake Kelly.

178
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,250
Of course, Mr. Kelly.

179
00:18:32,252 --> 00:18:33,052
Joan Stone.

180
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:35,454
Kathryn, gorgeous.

181
00:18:35,456 --> 00:18:37,824
Can I get one from the side?

182
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:39,293
Beautiful.

183
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:06,028
How do you know
so much about women?

184
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:11,001
I said how do you know
so much about women?

185
00:19:12,104 --> 00:19:13,939
I'm not sure that I do.

186
00:19:13,941 --> 00:19:15,640
Oh, what you do for...
looks like seriously.

187
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:16,309
You can't say it.

188
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,626
I've seen it a million times.

189
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:30,293
Really?

190
00:19:37,906 --> 00:19:38,671
Buy you a drink?

191
00:19:38,673 --> 00:19:41,308
Sounds good.

192
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:21,361
I was driving and he...

193
00:20:27,037 --> 00:20:28,871
...put his hand between my legs

194
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:33,376
and took the steering
wheel and...

195
00:20:36,951 --> 00:20:46,094
...and I saw the lights
and heard the noise.

196
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:47,963
And he...

197
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:49,398
He was dead.

198
00:20:54,873 --> 00:20:57,342
He died in my arms.

199
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,627
That was great.

200
00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:12,228
Great.

201
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,969
Can I try one more thing?

202
00:21:17,971 --> 00:21:20,373
It was dark, I was driving.

203
00:21:23,946 --> 00:21:29,918
And then he...

204
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,920
he put his hand between my legs.

205
00:21:31,922 --> 00:21:33,523
Well, it was such a
pleasure to meet you.

206
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:38,262
Thank you so much for coming in.

207
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:44,470
I am such a fan
of your mother's.

208
00:21:44,472 --> 00:21:48,943
You don't look like her.

209
00:21:48,945 --> 00:21:51,414
I take it after my dad.

210
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:11,753
It was a great audition.

211
00:23:11,755 --> 00:23:13,422
Bryan was there.

212
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:16,926
He practically offered
it to me on the spot.

213
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,729
Let's have some champagne.

214
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,065
I want to celebrate.

215
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,300
Yeah, where's Tony?

216
00:23:22,302 --> 00:23:23,234
Tony, hey.

217
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:24,670
Good evening.

218
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:27,974
Can I see the wine list?

219
00:23:27,976 --> 00:23:29,710
Of course.

220
00:23:31,346 --> 00:23:33,615
That one.

221
00:23:33,617 --> 00:23:35,417
Expensive taste
our little girl has.

222
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:37,020
It's okay.

223
00:23:38,189 --> 00:23:40,691
I just came straight
from the set.

224
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,129
Things are going so well.

225
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,300
There is huge buzz
about this movie.

226
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:52,307
A small independent like that
might not set the world a light.

227
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:54,376
But it's a great start.

228
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:02,086
I'm going to start
shooting in December.

229
00:24:02,088 --> 00:24:04,256
So I'm signing next week.

230
00:24:04,258 --> 00:24:05,791
Why now?

231
00:24:05,793 --> 00:24:06,693
What?

232
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,694
Why now?

233
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,064
Because I finally got a lead?

234
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:11,699
Your film has
nothing to do with it.

235
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:14,336
Then why are you
trying to compete with me?

236
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:17,573
Darling, we're
hardly in competition.

237
00:24:17,575 --> 00:24:24,082
I'm not trying to
compete with you.

238
00:24:24,084 --> 00:24:26,719
You are everything to me.

239
00:24:26,721 --> 00:24:28,153
I want you to be the best.

240
00:24:28,155 --> 00:24:30,423
I want you to shine like a star.

241
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:38,568
What movie is that from?

242
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,205
You're so transparent.

243
00:24:41,207 --> 00:24:45,443
You want me to succeed as long
as I don't do better than you.

244
00:24:49,284 --> 00:24:53,755
I've had enough.

245
00:24:53,757 --> 00:24:55,156
I'm going to the car.

246
00:24:55,158 --> 00:24:57,393
Check, we got the check.

247
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:06,071
You'll get over it.

248
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:08,408
Easy for you to say.

249
00:26:37,994 --> 00:26:39,995
Maybe I shouldn't do it.

250
00:26:39,997 --> 00:26:41,564
Not a good idea.

251
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,533
What do you think?

252
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,236
I think you're both
as crazy as each other.

253
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:51,711
So that's it?

254
00:26:51,713 --> 00:26:54,514
You don't understand.

255
00:26:54,516 --> 00:26:56,083
She's fragile.

256
00:26:56,085 --> 00:26:57,819
Yeah, so are you.

257
00:26:57,821 --> 00:27:01,290
No. I'm tougher than she is.

258
00:27:01,292 --> 00:27:04,094
After Max died, she
was very sick.

259
00:27:04,096 --> 00:27:08,199
I don't want to put
her off her game.

260
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:10,602
You want to just
give it all up for her?

261
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:15,442
I don't believe a word you say.

262
00:28:00,969 --> 00:28:03,438
Hi. I need to talk to you.

263
00:28:10,984 --> 00:28:12,450
I need to talk to you.

264
00:29:07,993 --> 00:29:10,628
Imagine what the worlds
would be like without her.

265
00:29:12,632 --> 00:29:15,066
You'd be free.

266
00:29:15,068 --> 00:29:16,702
I am free.

267
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:20,540
Why don't we leave together?

268
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:22,176
Because I can't afford you.

269
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:23,511
Oh, is that why you
stay with her, the money?

270
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:29,019
Do you think of me
when you stay with her?

271
00:29:29,021 --> 00:29:33,391
No, I don't.

272
00:29:33,393 --> 00:29:37,029
Who's that?

273
00:29:37,031 --> 00:29:41,335
I want to talk to you.

274
00:29:41,337 --> 00:29:42,503
Go ahead.

275
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:56,322
Is this place ever
going to be ready?

276
00:29:56,324 --> 00:29:57,556
You didn't come
all the way over here

277
00:29:57,558 --> 00:29:59,225
to discuss my apartment.

278
00:29:59,227 --> 00:30:01,896
Why don't we just
get it over with?

279
00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:03,364
Meaning what?

280
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:04,665
Of course, you
should do the movie.

281
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,068
I'm happy for you.

282
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,469
Thank you.

283
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:10,540
That's not what I
came to talk about.

284
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:25,560
Well, it's not the first time
you've been called a murderer.

285
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,900
It's a little
odd, don't you think?

286
00:30:30,902 --> 00:30:32,903
You told Jake?

287
00:30:32,905 --> 00:30:35,873
I want him to know.

288
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,576
What about Edie?

289
00:30:37,578 --> 00:30:38,978
What about her?

290
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,314
Done anything to
upset her lately?

291
00:30:41,316 --> 00:30:45,587
I don't... I just... I
think maybe she's feeling a

292
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:47,655
bit cutout.

293
00:30:48,892 --> 00:30:51,628
I came over here because
I wanted your advice.

294
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:55,533
to make sure it's not me.

295
00:31:09,318 --> 00:31:14,558
I'm... I'll call you.

296
00:31:18,498 --> 00:31:21,434
What are you going to do?

297
00:31:23,137 --> 00:31:24,471
Nothing.

298
00:31:25,574 --> 00:31:27,575
Nothing at all.

299
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,436
Hey! What are you doing?

300
00:31:48,438 --> 00:31:49,637
Nothing Daddy.

301
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:50,873
You wrote that
note, didn't you?

302
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,241
What? Of course I didn't.

303
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:58,549
I have no idea who's behind it,
but she's up to something.

304
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:08,930
I got to go.

305
00:32:08,932 --> 00:32:10,532
Don't go.

306
00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:13,769
We need to talk.

307
00:32:17,475 --> 00:32:18,576
Pathetic.

308
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:50,952
Listen, I'm... sorry I
didn't mean to bother you.

309
00:32:50,954 --> 00:32:53,355
I just... I've seen every
film that you've done

310
00:32:53,357 --> 00:32:56,059
and I think you're amazing.

311
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:57,527
Thank you very much.

312
00:32:57,529 --> 00:32:59,197
You know, I wrote
you several letters.

313
00:33:02,436 --> 00:33:05,305
No. Listen, I wrote
you several times.

314
00:33:05,307 --> 00:33:11,880
You know, I just wanted to talk
to you about something and...

315
00:33:11,882 --> 00:33:14,150
come on Kathryn, come on!

316
00:33:14,152 --> 00:33:16,954
Listen, I just... why
didn't you read my letters?

317
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:28,168
Your marriage to the late
industrialist Maximilian Pierce.

318
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,404
Max's killer has
never been found.

319
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,280
At the time, there
was some speculation

320
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:39,617
that you were involved
in his death.

321
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:46,626
Good morning.

322
00:33:56,306 --> 00:34:00,578
There's an article on page
six about your new film.

323
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:11,091
You need to call
Dr. Seger to

324
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:13,595
make an appointment.

325
00:35:13,141 --> 00:35:15,009
Honestly Humphrey,
they're all girl.

326
00:35:15,011 --> 00:35:18,581
Zoe especially.

327
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,484
No, no, I'm sure.

328
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:23,354
Yup, let's do it.

329
00:35:23,356 --> 00:35:25,790
Yeah, you're right.

330
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:27,626
Bye.

331
00:35:59,503 --> 00:36:00,403
Ready?

332
00:36:00,405 --> 00:36:01,604
I'm not coming.

333
00:36:01,606 --> 00:36:03,139
What's wrong now Kathryn?

334
00:36:03,141 --> 00:36:04,942
Are you crying?

335
00:36:04,944 --> 00:36:08,013
I have a headache.

336
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:09,281
Then cancel.

337
00:36:09,283 --> 00:36:11,350
They're your friends.

338
00:36:11,352 --> 00:36:13,720
They're your friends too.

339
00:36:13,722 --> 00:36:17,158
Give Jackie my love,
say I call her.

340
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,128
You know, I've meant
to tell you I can't go

341
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,663
to the country this weekend.

342
00:36:20,665 --> 00:36:21,630
I'm busy.

343
00:36:31,178 --> 00:36:32,645
Yo!

344
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:47,198
How are Martha and the boys?

345
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,203
Well enough, and Zoe?

346
00:36:51,205 --> 00:36:52,939
She's wonderful.

347
00:36:53,774 --> 00:36:57,478
I'm sorry, Kathryn, but
I'm not comfortable with this.

348
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,681
Why on earth not?

349
00:36:59,683 --> 00:37:02,552
I thought we discussed
reducing the dose,

350
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:03,887
not raising it.

351
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:06,524
I told you I can't sleep.

352
00:37:06,526 --> 00:37:10,862
I wish you'd consider
seeing Dr. Faroh.

353
00:37:10,864 --> 00:37:12,331
You might benefit...

354
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,434
I don't need a shrink.

355
00:37:14,436 --> 00:37:17,839
For Christ sake,
I have insomnia.

356
00:37:17,841 --> 00:37:21,744
How's the drinking?

357
00:37:24,282 --> 00:37:26,650
I'm asking for your help.

358
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:54,867
Jake?

359
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:56,301
Hey!

360
00:38:58,372 --> 00:38:59,473
What notes, what they say?

361
00:38:59,475 --> 00:39:04,246
I told you, just threats.

362
00:39:04,248 --> 00:39:05,080
What kind of threats?

363
00:39:05,082 --> 00:39:06,416
It matters.

364
00:39:06,418 --> 00:39:07,750
Where are they?

365
00:39:07,752 --> 00:39:08,551
I burned them.

366
00:39:08,553 --> 00:39:09,887
What?

367
00:39:14,427 --> 00:39:17,496
You hear anything?

368
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,004
No, but...

369
00:39:23,006 --> 00:39:24,640
But what?

370
00:39:26,843 --> 00:39:29,713
Nothing.

371
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:33,552
I think you should tell me.

372
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:34,219
Why don't you ask him?

373
00:39:39,493 --> 00:39:41,095
Yeah.

374
00:39:41,097 --> 00:39:42,229
Please.

375
00:39:42,231 --> 00:39:43,732
Ignore her.

376
00:39:43,734 --> 00:39:45,366
We should call the
cops, Kathryn.

377
00:39:45,368 --> 00:39:47,603
I already have.

378
00:39:47,605 --> 00:39:49,706
I'm meeting with the detective.

379
00:40:16,777 --> 00:40:18,744
You'd never go to the police.

380
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,753
Where you going?

381
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,923
Meet me at the scene
of the crime tomorrow.

382
00:40:52,925 --> 00:40:56,427
No specific demands yet.

383
00:40:56,429 --> 00:41:00,733
They want to scare you first.

384
00:41:00,735 --> 00:41:02,435
You have to do
better than that?

385
00:41:02,437 --> 00:41:05,739
There's no way anybody
has anything on you.

386
00:41:10,682 --> 00:41:14,017
Probably just some creep
inspired by your book.

387
00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:16,087
Now, making this
movie

388
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:18,757
I can't afford to
take any chances.

389
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:56,186
They told me I'm going to
look at the house tomorrow.

390
00:42:56,188 --> 00:42:59,623
You're not spending
the night?

391
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:04,664
But you haven't
been there since...

392
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:08,168
I haven't for it, that's all.

393
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,372
And now, you do?

394
00:43:10,374 --> 00:43:13,776
Yes. I'm done now.

395
00:43:21,755 --> 00:43:23,822
What are you doing?

396
00:43:23,824 --> 00:43:26,726
Don't be so dramatic, Zoe.

397
00:43:26,728 --> 00:43:27,494
Yeah. Yeah.

398
00:43:27,496 --> 00:43:28,496
Yeah. You got in.

399
00:43:28,498 --> 00:43:29,864
Yes, good talking to you, too.

400
00:43:29,866 --> 00:43:31,833
All right, see you soon.

401
00:43:32,935 --> 00:43:34,737
Hey!

402
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:38,409
Are you sure you don't
want me to come with you?

403
00:43:38,411 --> 00:43:39,943
I'm sure.

404
00:43:39,945 --> 00:43:41,546
Yeah?

405
00:43:41,548 --> 00:43:44,817
I'll call you from the house.

406
00:46:53,334 --> 00:46:54,401
What are you doing here?

407
00:46:54,403 --> 00:46:57,305
I tried calling you.

408
00:46:57,307 --> 00:46:58,573
Maybe I should stay with you.

409
00:46:58,575 --> 00:47:03,012
But I said I wanted
to be alone.

410
00:47:04,415 --> 00:47:06,817
I'll make you some tea.

411
00:47:55,449 --> 00:47:58,719
I thought you were filming?

412
00:47:58,721 --> 00:48:00,422
We wrapped early.

413
00:48:06,364 --> 00:48:09,901
Would you like some tea?

414
00:48:09,903 --> 00:48:12,605
I'd like to talk to you.

415
00:48:12,607 --> 00:48:14,974
Sure, I'll be right down.

416
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:20,314
If you want to keep
your secrets,

417
00:48:20,316 --> 00:48:23,485
you have to go to the country
house alone.

418
00:48:23,487 --> 00:48:25,889
Be there tomorrow.

419
00:48:25,891 --> 00:48:32,531
It reminds me of this sort
of pranks you used to call.

420
00:48:32,533 --> 00:48:33,999
Mom, it's not me.

421
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:37,504
What about Edie?

422
00:48:37,506 --> 00:48:39,873
What about me?

423
00:48:55,462 --> 00:48:57,130
You know what I think?

424
00:48:57,132 --> 00:48:59,667
Stop it!

425
00:49:01,403 --> 00:49:03,839
I trust him.

426
00:52:28,511 --> 00:52:30,145
What are you doing here?

427
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,115
I thought we could be alone.

428
00:52:32,117 --> 00:52:37,988
I'm going to change
for dinner.

429
00:52:47,669 --> 00:52:48,970
Hey, where are you going?

430
00:52:48,972 --> 00:52:52,007
Take your hands off me.

431
00:53:24,652 --> 00:53:27,086
After dinner, we should
walk around the house

432
00:53:27,088 --> 00:53:31,893
and discuss renovations.

433
00:53:31,895 --> 00:53:35,231
Oh, we had such a wonderful
times here.

434
00:53:35,233 --> 00:53:39,536
I know we can again.

435
00:53:39,538 --> 00:53:41,005
Remember Zoe,
when you were like...

436
00:53:41,007 --> 00:53:45,511
I'm not participating
in this performance.

437
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:46,580
What?

438
00:53:46,582 --> 00:53:50,918
Why is it impossible for you

439
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,756
to acknowledge what's
really happening?

440
00:53:54,758 --> 00:53:58,562
What did it say?

441
00:53:58,564 --> 00:54:01,098
More of the same thing.

442
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:04,369
Tell me what it said?

443
00:54:04,371 --> 00:54:06,305
She's being blackmailed.

444
00:54:06,307 --> 00:54:07,908
That's why she's here.

445
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:12,981
Zoe? That's enough.

446
00:54:24,931 --> 00:54:28,601
This whole thing
is just a sick joke.

447
00:54:28,603 --> 00:54:30,704
If anyone was coming,
wouldn't they be here by now?

448
00:54:30,706 --> 00:54:34,976
Not if it was one of us.

449
00:54:34,978 --> 00:54:38,749
Shut up.

450
00:54:38,751 --> 00:54:43,154
One of us wants
to hurt you, but why?

451
00:54:43,156 --> 00:54:46,158
Let's examine our motives.

452
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,629
I already have my
suspicions, but how about you,

453
00:54:49,631 --> 00:54:51,399
Jake, who gets your vote?

454
00:54:51,401 --> 00:54:55,270
My motive would
obviously be revenge

455
00:54:55,272 --> 00:54:57,240
for all this getting eclipsed.

456
00:54:57,242 --> 00:55:00,009
And Edie's would be jealousy.

457
00:55:00,011 --> 00:55:03,515
You've been green with envy
ever since she got married

458
00:55:03,517 --> 00:55:05,116
which brings us to Jake.

459
00:55:05,118 --> 00:55:08,254
Good. Well, if
anything happens to mom...

460
00:55:08,256 --> 00:55:10,991
Zoe, I want to talk to you.

461
00:55:27,547 --> 00:55:32,820
Why don't you go
and clear the dishes?

462
00:55:32,822 --> 00:55:34,789
I'm not your fucking servant.

463
00:55:34,791 --> 00:55:37,192
No, just hers.

464
00:55:37,194 --> 00:55:40,564
I care about her, unlike you.

465
00:55:40,566 --> 00:55:44,335
I hope you're not going to carry

466
00:55:44,337 --> 00:55:48,273
on with Zoe while we're
all under the same roof.

467
00:55:49,275 --> 00:55:53,214
What did you just say?

468
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:54,782
Perhaps, I imagined it.

469
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:56,151
Perhaps you did.

470
00:55:56,153 --> 00:55:58,988
Then you won't mind
if I tell Kathryn?

471
00:56:09,569 --> 00:56:11,471
Do that again
and I'll kill you.

472
00:56:11,473 --> 00:56:13,173
You don't need to come
between me and Jake.

473
00:56:13,175 --> 00:56:16,344
Why haven't you
told him the truth?

474
00:56:16,346 --> 00:56:24,021
I'll tell you, if you don't
trust him, you shouldn't.

475
00:56:30,565 --> 00:56:31,931
What happened?

476
00:56:31,933 --> 00:56:35,002
Zoe, what happened?

477
00:56:35,004 --> 00:56:35,736
What's wrong?

478
00:56:35,738 --> 00:56:37,672
What's going on?

479
00:56:37,674 --> 00:56:40,843
It's not important.

480
00:56:40,845 --> 00:56:42,178
Tell me what she said.

481
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:45,048
What makes you think
she said anything?

482
00:57:05,543 --> 00:57:06,777
You told her about us?

483
00:57:06,779 --> 00:57:08,012
I didn't.

484
00:57:08,014 --> 00:57:10,616
Why would I do that?

485
00:57:12,219 --> 00:57:15,555
Beause you want to hurt her.

486
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:22,565
She killed Max, didn't she?

487
00:57:22,567 --> 00:57:27,404
I should have guessed.

488
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:33,579
Max wasn't my father.

489
00:57:33,581 --> 00:57:35,048
I loved him.

490
00:57:59,549 --> 00:58:00,515
It's not going to work.

491
00:58:00,517 --> 00:58:02,517
What are you talking about?

492
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:04,887
She's not going to go for it.

493
00:58:04,889 --> 00:58:07,691
She doesn't trust
him for a second.

494
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:13,032
I should have never
let you talk me into this.

495
00:58:29,854 --> 00:58:31,990
That's enough now.

496
00:58:31,992 --> 00:58:33,859
You've been drinking.

497
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:41,236
I want to know something.

498
00:58:41,238 --> 00:58:49,914
Why do you and Zoe
dislike Jake so much?

499
00:58:49,916 --> 00:58:51,882
Don't talk.

500
00:58:51,884 --> 00:58:53,552
Close your eyes.

501
00:58:53,554 --> 00:58:56,456
She's jealous of them.

502
00:58:56,458 --> 00:59:00,027
And she was jealous of Max.

503
01:00:58,685 --> 01:01:00,987
Jesus Christ.

504
01:01:00,989 --> 01:01:06,961
What happened?

505
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:08,864
Kathryn.

506
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:10,766
Kathryn.

507
01:01:10,768 --> 01:01:15,106
Kathryn.

508
01:01:15,108 --> 01:01:17,643
Where is Zoe?

509
01:01:17,645 --> 01:01:21,881
Where is she?

510
01:01:21,883 --> 01:01:24,385
Kathryn, I need
to talk to you.

511
01:01:24,387 --> 01:01:26,120
Something's happening.

512
01:01:29,059 --> 01:01:33,697
I think we all
need to stay calm.

513
01:01:33,699 --> 01:01:34,731
Kathryn.

514
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:35,767
Oh, Kathryn.

515
01:01:35,769 --> 01:01:37,735
Hey, hey, hey.

516
01:01:37,737 --> 01:01:40,739
Put the gun down, come on.

517
01:01:40,741 --> 01:01:43,710
Did he say that I did it?

518
01:01:43,712 --> 01:01:46,047
I heard Zoe threaten to
tell you they were lovers.

519
01:01:46,049 --> 01:01:46,781
What?

520
01:01:46,783 --> 01:01:49,017
He said he would kill her.

521
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:51,721
Whoa. Hey, hey Kathryn,
don't listen to her.

522
01:01:51,723 --> 01:01:52,589
I saw them together.

523
01:01:52,591 --> 01:01:53,523
He killed her.

524
01:01:53,525 --> 01:01:54,157
Hey, gun down.

525
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:55,192
Come on.

526
01:01:55,194 --> 01:02:00,666
Kathryn, put the gun down.

527
01:02:00,668 --> 01:02:02,201
Where is she?

528
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:06,139
Where is she?

529
01:02:35,514 --> 01:02:37,180
I thought you would kill him?

530
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:41,966
I'm not going to jail.

531
01:03:44,437 --> 01:03:47,207
I can't protect you anymore.

532
01:03:53,183 --> 01:03:55,151
I'll tell him it was you.

533
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:03,161
I don't care.

534
01:04:20,052 --> 01:04:21,185
Mom!

535
01:04:42,748 --> 01:04:44,583
In entertainment
news, it's turning

536
01:04:44,585 --> 01:04:46,552

537
01:04:46,554 --> 01:04:49,089
as Hollywood still mourns
the loss of scriptwriter,

538
01:04:49,091 --> 01:04:52,460
Jake Kelly, who's killed in a
bizarre last year.

539
01:04:52,462 --> 01:04:54,096
While recovering
from tragic loss,

540
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:56,933
actress Kathryn Vale
was receiving high marks

541
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:58,868
for her role in Restricted.

542
01:04:58,870 --> 01:05:01,772
When asked about her
impressive come back, she says,

543
01:05:01,774 --> 01:05:05,276
"I took the pain and
made it into something."

544
01:05:05,278 --> 01:05:06,812
Well, that's something
has already turned

545
01:05:06,814 --> 01:05:09,583
in to an Oscar nomination,
and Vale is considered

to be a sympathetic favorite
among members of the academy

547
01:05:12,222 --> 01:05:14,555
who may see this
as an opportunity

548
01:05:14,557 --> 01:05:16,625
to finally recognize
her long career.
