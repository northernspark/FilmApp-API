-Like it's something to be ashamed of.

One of our famíly has left us.

1063
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:15,200
Mouschí ran away.

1064
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:19,480
We're all a líttle thínner.

1065
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:24,400
The Van Daans' díscussíons
are as víolent as ever.

1066
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:27,080
Mother stíll doesn't understand me.

1067
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:31,960
But then.
l don't understand her eíther.

1068
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:37,920
There ís one great change. however.. .

1069
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:41,040
.. .a change ín myself.

1070
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:46,440
l read somewhere that gírls of my age
don't feel quíte certaín of themselves.

1071
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:48,440
That they become quíet wíthín.. .

1072
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:54,160
...and begín to thínk of the míracle
that ís takíng place ín theír bodíes.

1073
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:59,320
l thínk that what ís happeníng
to me ís so wonderful.

1074
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:02,320
Not only what can be seen.. .

1075
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:06,320
.. .but what ís takíng place ínsíde.

1076
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:11,280
Each tíme ít has happened.
l feel l have a sweet secret.. .

1077
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:18,040
...and l long for the tíme when l shall
feel that secret wíthín me agaín.

1078
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:09,040
FRANK:
Annele! Peter!

1079
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:12,960
A wonderful surprise,
Mr. Kraler and Miep are here.

1080
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:15,240
Thank you. You shouldn't have come.

1081
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:18,880
You should have
at least one day to yourselves.

1082
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:21,880
ANNE: Don't say that.
It's so wonderful to see them.

1083
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:24,680
-What is it? What is it?
ANNE: Mr. Kraler.

1084
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:28,640
-Happy New Year, Mr. Dussel.
-Happy New Year.

1085
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,960
How are you, Margot?
Feeling any better?

1086
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:35,360
-l'm all right.
-We filled her full of every kind of pill...

1087
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,600
...so she won't cough
and make a noise.

1088
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:40,400
Look what Miep has brought us.

1089
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:42,840
A cake!

1090
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,400
ALL:
Ooh.

1091
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:47,360
-A cake.
-Well.

1092
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:50,160
l'll get some plates.

1093
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:52,200
-Thank you, Miep.
-Thank you.

1094
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:55,920
You must have used all
of your sugar rations for weeks.

1095
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:58,920
lt's beautiful, isn't it?

1096
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:01,320
lt's ages since l've even seen a cake.

1097
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:04,160
Not since you brought the one last year.
Remember?

1098
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:08,240
lt had ''Peace in 1 943'' written on it.

1099
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:13,000
''Peace in 1 944.''

1100
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:16,640
Peace has to come sometime,
you know.

1101
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:20,560
Here you are, líef_e.

1102
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:22,480
Now...

1103
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:24,960
-...how many of us are there?
MIEP: None for me.

1104
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:26,760
-Oh, you must.
-Please, Miep.

1105
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:30,720
Good. That leaves one, two, three....

1106
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:33,920
-Seven of us.
-Eight.

1107
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,960
The same as it always is.

1108
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:39,280
l left Margot out.
l take it for granted Margot won't eat.

1109
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:41,960
-Why wouldn't she?
-l think it won't harm her.

1110
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:47,120
All right, all right. l just didn't want her
to start coughing again, that's all.

1111
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:51,440
And please,
Mrs. Frank should cut the cake.

1112
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:53,440
What do you mean?

1113
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:56,960
Well, Mrs. Frank divides things better.

1114
01:49:57,120 --> 01:50:01,400
-Just what are you trying to say?
-Forget it, we're wasting time.

1115
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:04,280
Don't l always give everybody
exactly the same?

1116
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:09,280
-Don't l?
-Forget it.

1117
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:15,000
-No, l want an answer. Don't l?
-Yes, yes, yes.

1118
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:18,200
Everybody gets exactly the same.. .

1119
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:20,880
...except Mr. Van Daan gets
a little bit more.

1120
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:23,200
That's a lie!
She always cuts the same--

1121
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:25,360
Mr. Van Daan, please.

1122
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:30,520
You see, Miep, what a little sugar cake
does to us? It goes right to our heads.

1123
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:36,160
-Here you are, Mrs. Frank.
-Thank you.

1124
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:47,840
-You're sure you won't have any?
KRALER: Very sure.

1125
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:52,160
-Miep.
-No, thank you, really.

1126
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:55,160
Cut the cake.

1127
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:18,880
Thank you.

1128
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:25,320
EDITH :
That's yours, Peter.

1129
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:30,120
Maybe Mouschi went back
to our house.

1130
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:33,560
You ever get over there?
Do you think that you could?

1131
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:36,640
l'm afraid with him gone a week,
Peter....

1132
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:42,640
Make up your mind. Already someone
has had a big nice meal from that cat.

1133
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:51,480
-lt's delicious, Miep.
-Delicious.

1134
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:02,880
Well, l must run.
There's a party tonight.

1135
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:04,800
How heavenly!

1136
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:07,040
Remember what everyone's wearing.. .

1137
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:10,280
...and what you eat and everything
so you can tell us.

1138
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:11,960
MIEP:
l'll give you a full report.

1139
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:15,080
-Goodbye, everyone.
FRANK: Goodbye, Miep.

1140
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:18,960
Just a minute. There's something l'd
like you to do for me.

1141
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:21,480
PETRONELLA:
Where are you going?

1142
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:24,440
What are you going to do?

1143
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,080
No. Don't you dare take that coat.

1144
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:34,960
-What is wrong?
PETER: Father is going to sell her fur coat.

1145
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:38,480
-She's crazy about that old fur coat.
-lt's mine, you hear me?

1146
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:42,560
My father gave me that coat.
No! You have no right!

1147
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:45,840
ls it possible that anyone can...

1148
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:50,000
...be silly enough to worry about
a fur coat at a time like this?

1149
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,160
PETER:
It's none of your darn business.

1150
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:56,200
-And if you say one more thing--
FRANK: Peter.

1151
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:03,720
Just...

1152
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:08,040
...a little discussion on the advisability
of selling this coat.

1153
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:10,600
As l have often
reminded Mrs. Van Daan...

1154
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:13,840
...it's selfish of her to keep it
when people outside...

1155
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,440
...are in desperate need of clothing.

1156
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:18,560
So if you please, sell it for us?

1157
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:21,920
lt should fetch a good price.
And by the way...

1158
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:26,560
...would you get me cigarettes?
l don't care what kind, get all you can.

1159
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:31,920
lt is very difficult to get them,
Mr. Van Daan, but l'll try.

1160
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:34,440
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1161
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:37,840
Mr. Frank, could l talk to you?

1162
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:45,600
Something's happened, hasn't it,
Mr. Kraler? What's happened?

1163
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:48,960
lf it is something that concerns us
here, we'd better all hear it.

1164
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:50,840
-The children--
-What they'd imagine.. .

1165
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,160
...would be worse than any reality.

1166
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:56,320
lt is a man in the storeroom.
His name is Karl.

1167
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:59,320
You knew him.
One day, he came to the office.

1168
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:01,160
He closed the door and asked:

1169
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:04,000
''What do you hear
from your friend Mr. Frank?''

1170
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:06,800
l said there's a rumor
you were in Switzerland.

1171
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:11,000
He said he had heard that rumor too,
but he thought l knew something more.

1172
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:14,160
l did not pay much attention.
l tried to forget it.

1173
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:20,440
And then yesterday, we were coming
out of the storeroom, out there.

1174
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:24,040
l had started down to the office.

1175
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:25,920
l looked back.

1176
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:29,640
He was standing,
staring at the bookcase.

1177
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:33,720
He said, ''l thought l remembered
a door up here.

1178
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:38,200
Was not there a door code(0125)ere leading
to the loft?

1179
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:40,600
Then he asked me for more money.

1180
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:42,800
-20 guilders more a week.
-Blackmail.

1181
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:48,040
-20 guilders? Very modest blackmail.
-That's just the beginning.

1182
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:51,040
You know what l think?

1183
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:54,600
He's the thief who
was down there that night.

1184
01:54:54,760 --> 01:54:56,760
That's how he knows we're here.

1185
01:54:56,920 --> 01:54:59,320
How was it left?
What did you tell him?

1186
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:01,920
l told him l had to think about it.

1187
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:06,120
What shall l do, pay him the money?
Take a chance on firing him, or what?

1188
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:09,040
-l do not know.
-For heaven sakes, don't fire him.

1189
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:10,520
Pay him what he asks.

1190
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:13,360
Keep him here,
where you can keep your eye on him.

1191
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:16,720
ls it much that he's asking?
What are they paying nowadays?

1192
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:20,360
He could get it in a war plant.
But this is not a war plant.

1193
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:24,960
Mind you,
l do not know if he knows or not.

1194
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:31,080
Offer him half, then we'll soon know
if it is blackmail or not.

1195
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:35,120
And if it is?
We've got to pay, haven't we?

1196
01:55:35,320 --> 01:55:41,280
-Whatever he asks, we've got to pay.
-Let us decide when the time comes.

1197
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:45,000
This may be all my imagination.
You get to a point, these days...

1198
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:48,080
.. .where you suspect everyone
and everything.

[SIRENS WAILING]
[TELEPHONE RINGING]

1200
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:09,400
What does that mean,
the telephone ringing on a holiday?

1201
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:15,760
That's my wife. l told her l had
to go over some papers in my office...

1202
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:19,200
...to call me here when she got out
of church. Goodbye.

01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:50,480
l tell you,
it's just a question of time now.

1209
01:56:55,720 --> 01:56:59,520
Sometimes l wish the end would come,
whatever it is.

1210
01:57:00,160 --> 01:57:04,320
-Margot!
-At least we'd know where we were.

1211
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:09,040
You should be ashamed of yourself,
talking that way.

1212
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:12,000
Think how lucky we are.

1213
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:16,640
Think of the thousands dying
in the war every day.

1214
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:19,160
Think of the people
in concentration camps.

1215
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:21,560
What's the good of that?

1216
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:25,760
What's the good of thinking of misery
when you're already miserable?

1217
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:28,200
That's stupid!

1218
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:30,760
We're young,
Margot and Peter and l.

1219
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:35,040
You grownups have had your chance.

1220
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:40,480
But look at us. If we begin thinking
of all the horror in the world, we're lost.

1221
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:44,240
We're trying to hold on to some kind
of ideals when everything--

1222
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:48,640
ldeals, hope, everything
is being destroyed.

1223
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:52,800
lt isn't our fault the world
is in such a mess.

1224
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:56,000
-We weren't around when this started.
-You listen to me!

1225
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:58,560
So don't try to take it out on us!

1226
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:11,320
VAN DAAN:
She talks as if we started the war.

1227
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:14,600
Did we start the war?

1228
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:28,840
-You left this.
-Thanks.

1229
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:35,600
l thought you were fine just now.

1230
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:38,960
You know how to talk to them.
l can't think when l'm mad.

1231
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:42,280
l say too much.

1232
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:45,160
l hurt people's feelings.

1233
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:49,680
l think you're just fine.

1234
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:02,760
Thank you, Peter.

1235
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:12,640
J
Dussel, what he said about Mouschi
about somebody eating him...

1236
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:15,280
...all l could think is l wanted
to hit him.

1237
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:17,440
That's what l used to do at school.

1238
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:20,000
But here a fight starts,
l duck in my room.

1239
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:23,240
You're lucky, having a room to go to.

1240
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:26,280
His Lordship is always in mine.

1241
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:30,240
When they start in on me,
l have to stand and take it.

1242
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:33,480
You gave some of it back
to them just now.

1243
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:36,440
l get so mad.

1244
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:39,040
They've formed their opinions.. .

1245
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:41,840
.. .about everything.

1246
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:46,440
But we're still trying to find out.

1247
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:52,080
We have problems here that
no other people our age have ever had.

1248
01:59:52,240 --> 01:59:54,640
And just as you
think you've solved them...

1249
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:59,280
...something comes along and bang!

1250
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:02,240
You have to start all over again.

1251
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:10,360
-l think your father's fine.
-Oh, he is, Peter. He is.

1252
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:15,480
He's the only one who's ever given me
the feeling that l have any sense.

1253
02:00:20,240 --> 02:00:23,560
lsn't it funny, you and l?

1254
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:26,280
Here we've been together
all this time.. .

1255
02:00:26,440 --> 02:00:30,160
...and this is the first time we've
ever really talked.

1256
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:37,080
lt helps a lot to have someone to talk to,
doesn't it?

1257
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:40,480
lt helps you let off steam.

1258
02:00:57,080 --> 02:01:01,480
Anytime that you want
to let off steam...

1259
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:03,840
...you can come into my room.

1260
02:01:05,480 --> 02:01:08,560
l can get up an awful lot of steam.

1261
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:11,840
lt's all right with me.

1262
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,200
Do you mean that?

1263
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:20,480
l said it, didn't l?

1264
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:39,560
-Good night.
-Good night.

1265
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,760
Good night.

1266
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:57,720
-May l come in?
ANNE: No, l'm not dressed yet.

1267
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:25,280
Margot.

1268
02:02:25,480 --> 02:02:29,800
-Tell me, am l terribly ugly?
MARGOT: Oh, stop fishing.

1269
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:31,600
No, tell me.

1270
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:35,760
Of course you're not.
You've got nice eyes...

1271
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:38,720
...and a lot of animation and....

1272
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,000
-May l come in?
MARGOT: Come in, Mother.

1273
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:08,560
EDITH: Mr. Dussel is impatient to get in.
ANNE: He takes the room all day.

1274
02:03:08,760 --> 02:03:12,240
You're not going in again tonight
to see Peter?

1275
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:15,880
That is my intention.

1276
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:21,000
Aren't you afraid
you're disturbing him?

1277
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:23,320
Mother, l have some intuition.

1278
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:29,400
Then may l ask this much, Annie?
Don't shut the door when you go in.

1279
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,040
You sound like Mrs. Van Daan.

1280
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:37,000
No, no. l don't mean
to suggest anything is wrong.

1281
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:40,240
l only wish you wouldn't
expose yourself to criticism.

1282
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:44,080
l'm sorry, Mother.
l'm going to Peter's room.

1283
02:03:44,240 --> 02:03:49,280
l'm not going to let Petronella Van Daan
spoil our friendship.

1284
02:03:54,040 --> 02:03:56,840
Just a moment, Mr. Dussel.

1285
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:01,440
ln my day,
the boys called on the girls.

1286
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:04,160
EDITH: You know how young people are.
Peter's room...

1287
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:07,080
-...is the only place where they can talk.
-Talk?

1288
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:09,920
That's not what they called it
when l was a girl.

1289
02:04:12,240 --> 02:04:16,360
l'm sorry, Margot,
that you have to be the one left out.

1290
02:04:18,040 --> 02:04:22,560
-l feel so guilty about you.
-Why?

1291
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:29,440
l mean,
every time l go into Peter's room...

1292
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:33,120
...l have the feeling
that l'm hurting you.

1293
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:37,720
l know if it were me,
l'd be desperately jealous.

1294
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:44,240
l am jealous, a little,
but not of you and Peter.

1295
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:46,400
l'm....

1296
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:49,760
l'm only feeling sorry
that l haven't anyone...

1297
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:53,000
...with whom to discuss my feelings.

1298
02:04:53,160 --> 02:04:56,640
-Margot, l won't even--
-Listen, you've found a companionship...

1299
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:58,560
...and l want you to enjoy it.

1300
02:04:58,760 --> 02:05:05,080
Only, in my heart, l feel l've got a
right to share feelings with someone too.

1301
02:05:05,680 --> 02:05:10,480
But l'm sure that Peter, that that boy,
he could never be that person for me.

1302
02:05:10,640 --> 02:05:12,160
[KNOCKING]

1303
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:16,360
Maybe there's nothing
to be jealous about.

1304
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:19,200
Maybe l'm just taking
the place of his cat.

1305
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:24,760
-Will you please let me in my room?
ANNE: Just a minute, dear Mr. Dussel.

1306
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:40,760
Well, here l go, to run the gauntlet.

1307
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:46,080
Thank you so much.

1308
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:59,680
Look at her.

1309
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:04,560
A lot of good it did me to have a son.
l never see him.

1310
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:08,080
Just a minute, dear.

1311
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:12,680
l'd like to say a few words to my son.
Do you mind?

1312
02:06:12,920 --> 02:06:16,160
Peter, l do not want you staying up
till all hours tonight.

1313
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:18,480
You need sleep.
You're a growing boy.

1314
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:22,200
Annie won't stay late.
She's going to bed promptly at 9.

1315
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:26,120
-Aren't you, Annie?
-Yes, Mother. May we go now?

1316
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:28,440
Listen for the chimes, dear.

1317
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:50,880
Aren't they impossible?

1318
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:56,520
Treating us as if we're still
in the nursery.

1319
02:06:56,680 --> 02:07:00,840
Don't let it bother you.
It doesn't bother me.

1320
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:07,400
l suppose you can't really blame them.

1321
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:11,400
They think back
to what they were like at our age.

1322
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:15,880
They don't realize
how much more advanced we are.

1323
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:30,240
Already l know what l want to do,
don't you?

1324
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:33,200
l want to be a journalist or something.

1325
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:35,720
l love to write.

1326
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:39,360
What do you want to do?

1327
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:43,160
l know what l'd like right now.

1328
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:46,720
l'd like to go to England and get
with the Free Dutch forces.

1329
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:52,400
Peter, you wouldn't try a thing like that.
You'd never make it.

1330
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:54,440
l'd make it.

1331
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:03,160
Only a few of the hundreds that try do.

1332
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:07,960
l know, but l'd like
to get in it and hit back.

1333
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:12,120
To just sit here, it's not for me.

1334
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:19,080
You like Margot, don't you?

1335
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:21,400
Right from the start, you liked her.

1336
02:08:21,560 --> 02:08:24,320
Liked her better than me.

1337
02:08:26,120 --> 02:08:28,480
-l don't know.
-lt's all right.

1338
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:33,040
Everyone feels that way.
Margot's so good.

1339
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:37,920
She's sweet and bright and beautiful,
and l'm not.

1340
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:41,680
-l wouldn't say that.
ANNE: Oh, no, l'm not.

1341
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:46,120
l know that.
l know quite well that l'm not a beauty.

1342
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:49,080
l never have been and never shall be.

1343
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:52,080
l don't agree at all.

1344
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:55,520
l think you're pretty.

1345
02:08:55,680 --> 02:08:57,760
That's not true.

1346
02:08:57,960 --> 02:09:00,200
And another thing.

1347
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:04,560
You've changed. From the first, l mean.

1348
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:07,800
l have?

1349
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:11,960
l used to think
that you were awful noisy.

1350
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:19,040
And what do you think now, Peter?
How have l changed?

1351
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:20,880
Well.. .

1352
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:24,960
.. .you're quieter.

1353
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:29,200
l'm glad you don't just hate me.

1354
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:32,680
l never said that.

1355
02:09:54,080 --> 02:09:58,960
l bet when you get out of here,
you'll never think of me again.

1356
02:09:59,120 --> 02:10:01,320
That's crazy.

1357

where l used to go with Father...

1659
02:38:29,480 --> 02:38:34,440
...where crocus and jonquils
and the violets grow along the slopes.

You know...

...the most wonderful part
of thinking yourself outside?

1662

You can have it any way you like.

tulips all blooming in the same season.
