1
00:00:06,314 --> 00:00:09,647
So how'd it go last night?
Oh, no!

2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,278
- Would you hand me that?
- Nice gloves. Are they new?

3
00:00:12,353 --> 00:00:15,811
What do you got when you
have a lawyer up to his neck in cement?

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,824
- Your boyfriend out of jail yet?
- Not yet.

5
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,292
Jack, one guess.

6
00:00:20,361 --> 00:00:23,990
Four Seasons. That's easy.
What's the flip side?

7
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:27,501
Flip side? Flip side.
What is the flip side?

8
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,163
Oh, shit, now my whole day's ruined.

9
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,103
Is everything laid out?

10
00:00:32,173 --> 00:00:34,038
Everything you like.

11
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:37,545
Oh, these are my favorites.

12
00:00:42,617 --> 00:00:45,848
- What's the story on our friend?
- He jumped, five floors.

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,013
Oh, good grief.

14
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:51,149
What do you want on this?
Pickle, lettuce, tomato? Onion?

15
00:00:51,226 --> 00:00:53,091
What do you want?
Want a coke? No coke?

16
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:55,994
No, use more Betadine, sweetheart.
He needs the color.

17
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,862
Let's go, Jack. I'm having trouble
keeping his pressure up.

18
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:02,460
Just splash and slash.

19
00:01:02,537 --> 00:01:05,870
You know, Murray, they ought
to teach a course in suicide technique.

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,071
I mean, five floors
is just not good enough.

21
00:01:12,547 --> 00:01:16,950
People use the wrong knife,
can't tie a decent knot. It's terrible.

22
00:01:17,018 --> 00:01:19,816
Nancy, when are you gonna run away
with me? I'm desperate.

23
00:01:19,888 --> 00:01:21,651
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

24
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:26,922
OK. Blade.

25
00:01:32,867 --> 00:01:36,928
I'm going right in.
We'll tidy up on the way out.

26
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,244
Oh, look at that. You made him bleed.

27
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,443
Retractor.

28
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:58,949
- Oh, boy, he's a gusher.
- I hate blood.

29
00:01:59,027 --> 00:02:03,691
Cell-saver suction. Malleable, Nancy.

30
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:05,858
The BP's dropping all the time.
I can't keep up with his loss.

31
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:10,064
This guy's aorta is in big trouble.
Cut down on the ventilation, Joe.

32
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:13,539
- Move the lung out of the way.
- OK, I'm hand-ventilating.

33
00:02:16,644 --> 00:02:18,805
Oh, shit.

34
00:02:20,114 --> 00:02:22,981
The aorta's completely transected.

35
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,882
- What do you wanna do?
- Turn off the music.

36
00:02:27,956 --> 00:02:31,119
Clamp and run.
Give me a 20-millimeter Dacron graft.

37
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:32,954
On my way.

38
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:36,086
Clamp? Thank you.

39
00:02:36,163 --> 00:02:40,190
- We need some over here.
- I'm getting in a clamp above.

40
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:46,103
- Snap!
- Clamp. I'm getting in a clamp below...

41
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:49,108
- I got it, I got it.
- Start the clock!

42
00:02:49,176 --> 00:02:51,041
OK. Take this, will you?
Get it. Take it out.

43
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:53,102
Graft.

44
00:02:55,282 --> 00:02:57,375
I got it.

45
00:03:01,288 --> 00:03:04,746
- 4-0 Prolene, let's go!
- 4-0 Prolene, Doctor.

46
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:08,828
- Give him more blood, Joe.
- He's got all we had. We sent for more.

47
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:11,729
Knit one.

48
00:03:11,798 --> 00:03:15,199
He's 60 over zip.
But we still have a cardiac rhythm.

49
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:17,464
Not for long.

50
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:21,234
- Nancy, are my hands shaking?
- No, Doctor.

51
00:03:21,308 --> 00:03:24,243
That's amazing.
I always tremble when you're near.

52
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:31,006
You've got about three minutes, Jack,
and then he's in big trouble.

53
00:03:33,887 --> 00:03:35,821
What's the difference between a...

54
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:38,016
Nancy, if you know this one,
don't say anything.

55
00:03:38,091 --> 00:03:42,357
What's the difference between
a lawyer and a catfish?

56
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:47,095
- You know?
- No idea.

57
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:53,106
One is a scum-sucking bottom dweller...
and the other one's a fish.

58
00:04:00,714 --> 00:04:04,206
- Right over left and under.
- Left over right and under.

59
00:04:04,284 --> 00:04:06,275
Good scout.

60
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:13,385
OK, here we go. I'm going
to unclamp slowly. Watch the BP.

61
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:17,724
- Clamp.
- Easy.

62
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:22,826
- Off.
- No leaks. We made it.

63
00:04:22,903 --> 00:04:24,894
Looks beautiful.

64
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:28,430
Ooo-wee!

65
00:04:28,508 --> 00:04:32,501
Let's pack our bags, guys,
and go home. Closing music, Joe.

66
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:37,573
Oh, that was great, everybody.
And, Nancy, I wanna hear you sing.

67
00:04:37,651 --> 00:04:38,879
Sure, Doctor.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,074
Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

69
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:51,562
Nancy, you're not singing, doll.

70
00:04:51,631 --> 00:04:58,002
One day, Nancy, one day before I die,
you're gonna sing for me.

71
00:04:58,705 --> 00:04:59,967
Doctor, please.

72
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,613
Sing it. Sing it, buddy! You're gonna
be OK. What's this kid's name?

73
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,825
Sing it, Nancy, baby.

74
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,295
Dr. MacKee? Dr. Blumfield
would like you to stop by OR 2

75
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,837
and take a look at his patient.

76
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:37,502
- Wow. Where ENT meets ESP.
- Rabbi calls. Go take a look.

77
00:05:37,577 --> 00:05:39,909
- The spirits wait.
- Will you finish up here?

78
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,108
My pleasure. Don't forget your crystals.

79
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:45,777
Or a Ouija board.

80
00:05:45,852 --> 00:05:50,050
Jack, you throw the wildest parties.
Come on, little doggie.

81
00:05:50,123 --> 00:05:53,149
Come on, fella, wake this kid up.
Have him join us.

82
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:57,856
When that boy wakes up, tell him,
next time, ten floors minimum.

83
00:05:57,931 --> 00:06:00,923
- Reach for the sky!
- Look out!

84
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:04,027
You hear that, boy?
That was Dr. Jack MacKee.

85
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:07,005
- I need a gown.
- Here you go.

86
00:06:09,476 --> 00:06:11,467
Here, Doctor.

87
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:21,382
Thank you for coming, Doctor.
I've got a rigid bronchoscopy, and...

88
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:27,360
I'd like you to take a look. I think I found
a lesion in the right main bronchus.

89
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:31,061
- He's under for another 20?
- Mm-hmm.

90
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:39,062
Sergio, this is Dr. MacKee.
He's an expert in heart and lungs.

91
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:45,942
And I'd like him to check you out.
There's nothing to be nervous about.

92
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:49,345
Hi, Serge. How's it hanging?
I gotta tell ya, if you can hear me,

93
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:52,977
I'd fire the anesthesiologist.

94
00:06:53,053 --> 00:06:55,521
Dr. MacKee likes to joke.

95
00:06:55,589 --> 00:07:00,390
Doesn't mean he's not caring,
that's just his way. He's a fine doctor.

96
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:06,125
Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

97
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,394
- Blumfield's amazing.
- Yeah. He published a paper:

98
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:12,063
"Dialogue With Unconscious Patients".
Personally I keep it under my pillow.

99
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,573
But this guy really believes
that they hear us.

100
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,202
- I talk to you.
- But I pretend I'm conscious.

101
00:07:19,278 --> 00:07:21,576
- You eating?
- I don't know. I have some chores.

102
00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:23,615
What is it with this throat thing, huh?

103
00:07:23,682 --> 00:07:25,946
You know, Pete wants to do a bypass
on that short order cook.

104
00:07:26,018 --> 00:07:29,920
What's his name? Such a stupid name.
Heart the size of Pennsylvania.

105
00:07:29,989 --> 00:07:33,390
He's 65, he's 250 pounds, he had
a stroke, smokes two packs a day...

106
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:34,551
Sounds in pretty good shape.

107
00:07:34,627 --> 00:07:37,619
So the guy crumps in six months
and it shows on our survival stats. Hi.

108
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:39,926
Hi.

109
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:41,694
- Hello, Doctor.
- Sarah.

110
00:07:47,606 --> 00:07:50,131
See you later.

111
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:51,767
You hunk.

112
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:54,438
- Ta-ta.
- Toodle-oo.

113
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:20,898
Aaah.

114
00:08:20,973 --> 00:08:25,034
- How long have you had this throat?
- All my life.

115
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:29,242
I don't know. A couple of... A little while.

116
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:34,548
I can't really see anything.
A little swelling, some inflammation.

117
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,922
Nothing to really worry about.
Are you steaming or what?

118
00:08:39,992 --> 00:08:41,789
What?

119
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,691
- No, nothing.
- No, nothing.

120
00:08:43,762 --> 00:08:47,289
No wonder you still got a tickle.
What are you doing wasting my time?

121
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:51,996
- I'm married to a doctor's wife.
- You too, huh?

122
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:57,202
- Should I be referring you to someone?
- No.

123
00:08:57,276 --> 00:09:00,734
You're right. I should be steaming.

124
00:09:00,813 --> 00:09:04,044
I'll write you a note for some antibiotics.

125
00:09:04,116 --> 00:09:09,110
Better I should write to Anne,
prescribe TLC. How is she?

126
00:09:11,123 --> 00:09:13,114
She's terrific.

127
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,027
I never see you guys
since your dad passed on.

128
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:26,365
No, I-I kept clearing my throat,
it was like this habit thing.

129
00:09:28,073 --> 00:09:32,305
- Here, Jack.
- Thanks.

130
00:09:35,614 --> 00:09:41,280
- How's business in the big league?
- We're killing 'em.

131
00:09:46,425 --> 00:09:50,885
Hi. How're we doing?
I'm sorry I kept you waiting. Busy day.

132
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:53,124
- Are we looking after you?
- Yes, thank you.

133
00:09:53,198 --> 00:09:55,462
Good.

134
00:09:55,534 --> 00:09:59,436
- Have you been sore?
- A little sore, yeah.

135
00:10:00,472 --> 00:10:02,406
OK.

136
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:07,869
Oh, yeah. That's healed fine.
Let's just get those staples out.

137
00:10:08,747 --> 00:10:13,582
Doctor, my husband...

138
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:20,023
He's a good man, and he...
I think he's a little nervous.

139
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,628
Will the scar always be so...?

140
00:10:23,696 --> 00:10:26,665
Tell your husband you look
like a Playboy centerfold.

141
00:10:26,732 --> 00:10:29,462
You have the staple marks to prove it.

142
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:39,603
No, no. No! No, no.

143
00:10:39,678 --> 00:10:43,876
I can smell tobacco from 50 paces.
I can smell it through the phone.

144
00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:46,611
You know how I quit?
I'll tell you the truth.

145
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:48,516
I could kill for a cigarette
this very second.

146
00:10:48,587 --> 00:10:53,854
I'll give you back to my secretary. We'll
arrange to have you in for some tests.

147
00:10:53,926 --> 00:10:56,759
Carrie, take him back. Slap his wrist.

148
00:10:56,829 --> 00:11:02,426
He's not taking the cyclosporine
and he's smoking again.

149
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:06,697
Whoa. Wait a minute.

150
00:11:06,772 --> 00:11:11,175
What? Pete? Just tell him I'll call back.

151
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:29,191
My, my.

152
00:11:54,253 --> 00:11:57,814
Legs! Whoo!

153
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:06,655
I wouldn't be caught dead with someone
stupid enough to drive that car.

154
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:11,532
Too bad. You'll be missing
my electric roll-in-the-hay bar.

155
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,231
Well, why didn't you say so?

156
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:19,977
- Hi.
- Hi.

157
00:12:20,044 --> 00:12:21,375
- We have a dumpster.
- Mm-hmm.

158
00:12:21,446 --> 00:12:23,539
Do we have a contractor? No.

159
00:12:23,614 --> 00:12:26,742
- We do.
- This is a record. They've started.

160
00:12:26,818 --> 00:12:29,252
- Yeah, they started wrecking the place.
- Anne...

161
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,117
- What?
- Anne...

162
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:35,057
They'll have the old kitchen out and the
new one in, and you won't feel a thing.

163
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:37,686
- And I know about pain. I'm a doctor.
- "I'm a doctor."

164
00:12:37,762 --> 00:12:42,165
- Is it OK about tonight?
- I'm a little nervous, but it'll be fine.

165
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:44,064
- Why are you nervous?
- Gee, I don't know.

166
00:12:44,135 --> 00:12:46,831
I'm usually so comfortable
speaking in front of 200 people.

167
00:12:46,904 --> 00:12:48,235
You don't have to speak. I'll speak.

168
00:12:48,306 --> 00:12:51,070
You just stand by my side
and look gorgeous.

169
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:54,873
No, I have to speak. Wait, wait. Are we
talking about the same thing here?

170
00:12:54,946 --> 00:12:57,938
Jack? The parents' meeting?

171
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,382
- Oh, no. No, Jack.
- Hello?

172
00:13:01,452 --> 00:13:04,910
Don't tell me you forgot again.

173
00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:08,618
And then you wonder why the kids
call me "Miss" MacKee!

174
00:13:08,693 --> 00:13:13,824
- You're a total disaster.
- Well, I need you tonight as well.

175
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,260
- Hey.
- I have to change.

176
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:25,733
We can have dinner together
somewhere later.

177
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:29,974
And you'll still forget next year,
won't you? Yeah.

178
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:48,526
- Hola. Lucy. Como estas?
- Bad.

179
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:50,590
OK.

180
00:13:51,636 --> 00:13:56,437
- Hey, kneepads and helmets.
- Why? We're staying in our yard.

181
00:13:56,507 --> 00:13:59,840
And what, you think
our concrete is softer?

182
00:13:59,911 --> 00:14:01,606
- Hi, Max.
- Hi, Dr. MacKee.

183
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:04,307
- You, too.
- OK.

184
00:14:04,382 --> 00:14:06,247
- How was school?
- Pretty good.

185
00:14:06,317 --> 00:14:07,306
Good.

186
00:14:11,322 --> 00:14:13,517
If it leaks again, just...

187
00:14:25,469 --> 00:14:28,029
- Hi.
- Hi. How'd it go?

188
00:14:28,105 --> 00:14:31,973
Not bad. I only fainted once.
How was yours?

189
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:35,570
I personally collected a check
for $50,000 towards a new wing

190
00:14:35,646 --> 00:14:38,376
from some guy who's big in glue.

191
00:14:39,517 --> 00:14:42,111
- Let's go spend it.
- Yeah.

192
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:49,483
Well, what do you know? Oh, you're
not gonna answer it? Come on.

193
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,528
- No.
- Jack.

194
00:14:51,596 --> 00:14:55,327
You're sounding tired again, you know.
You are. You're doing too much, honey.

195
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:58,095
Let's just skip dinner and go home

196
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:01,502
and I'll fix you something
while I still have a kitchen.

197
00:15:01,572 --> 00:15:03,563
OK.

198
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:11,809
- Hello.
- Jack...

199
00:15:11,882 --> 00:15:16,819
Yes, OK. Yeah, OK, put her through.

200
00:15:20,825 --> 00:15:23,259
Mrs. Street, this is Dr. MacKee.

201
00:15:23,327 --> 00:15:25,295
<i>- Dr. MacKee?
- Yup.</i>

202
00:15:25,363 --> 00:15:28,332
<i>Well. You know what it is.
I'm lying here worrying.</i>

203
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,162
Why would that be?

204
00:15:30,234 --> 00:15:32,498
<i>You took out my husband's lung
a month ago.</i>

205
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:36,666
<i>Now he wants to mow the lawn.
Can he do that?</i>

206
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:40,006
<i>- Well, it's pretty dark, but...
- Excuse me?</i>

207
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:41,442
What's he saying?

208
00:15:41,512 --> 00:15:45,710
Does your husband have
a power mower, or does he push it?

209
00:15:45,783 --> 00:15:50,243
<i>Power mower? I don't know. Whatever
you say. He'll mow the lawn anyway.</i>

210
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:53,313
<i>- That's the way he is.
- You know I got a damn power mower!</i>

211
00:15:53,391 --> 00:15:55,689
<i>- What?
- I got a power mower!</i>

212
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,823
<i>He says it is a power mower. Hello?</i>

213
00:16:00,898 --> 00:16:06,336
I'm sure it'll be fine.
The exercise will do him good. OK?

214
00:16:06,404 --> 00:16:09,396
OK.

215
00:16:21,352 --> 00:16:26,346
- You OK?
- What? Yeah, I'm fine.

216
00:16:27,024 --> 00:16:32,724
What's that on your shirt?
Jack, is that blood?

217
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:41,800
You know what? I must have burst
a blood vessel trying not to laugh.

218
00:16:41,872 --> 00:16:44,898
Jack, I have blood on my dress.

219
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:51,144
My God, I have it in my hair, Jack.
What's going on?

220
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:55,708
- Hey, relax.
- Relax? Has this happened before?

221
00:16:55,785 --> 00:16:58,686
I'm not bleeding to death here.

222
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:05,861
<i>There's a danger in feeling
too strongly about your patients.</i>

223
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:08,963
A danger in becoming too involved.

224
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:15,735
Surgery is about judgment.
To judge, you have to be detached.

225
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:18,933
But isn't it unnatural not to become
involved with a patient?

226
00:17:19,008 --> 00:17:22,375
There's nothing natural about surgery.
You're cutting open someone's body.

227
00:17:22,445 --> 00:17:26,245
Is that natural? One day you'll have
your hands around someone's heart.

228
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:29,911
And it's beating. And you'll think,
"Uh-oh. I shouldn't be here."

229
00:17:29,986 --> 00:17:32,546
Well, then all the more reason
to care about what the patient feels.

230
00:17:32,622 --> 00:17:36,490
- The patient feels sick.
- A surgeon's job is to cut.

231
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,258
You've got one shot.
You go in, you fix it and get out.

232
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:42,320
- Fix it. Get out.
- Get out. Yeah.

233
00:17:42,398 --> 00:17:45,265
Caring's all about time.

234
00:17:45,335 --> 00:17:50,238
When you've got 30 seconds
before some guy bleeds out...

235
00:17:50,306 --> 00:17:53,207
I'd rather you cut straight
and cared less.

236
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:59,177
Now, Harris here took a walk
from a fifth floor window.

237
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,574
Should we come back?

238
00:18:05,455 --> 00:18:07,787
I'll be back.

239
00:18:08,224 --> 00:18:09,452
Here, Alan.

240
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:13,895
"Transected aorta,
partially controlled by the pleura."

241
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:16,693
- Procedure?
- Clamp above and below.

242
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:19,894
You can suture the tear direct
or use a Dacron graft.

243
00:18:19,969 --> 00:18:21,766
What do we look for
when we go in, Jay-Jay?

244
00:18:21,838 --> 00:18:24,807
Apart from a great deal
of caring? Anyone?

245
00:18:24,874 --> 00:18:26,933
Significant continuing
blood loss and color.

246
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,912
Yeah. How're we doing?

247
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:36,111
I hadn't planned on ever waking up.
I feel stupid.

248
00:18:36,186 --> 00:18:39,087
You want my advice, Robert?
Next time you wanna give yourself

249
00:18:39,155 --> 00:18:47,255
some real punishment... try golf.
There's no greater torture.

250
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:52,057
Thank you.

251
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,496
I need you to take
as deep a breath as you can.

252
00:18:59,776 --> 00:19:02,074
If you were looking for a good ENT man,
who would you go to?

253
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:03,976
- The Rabbi?
- Give me a break.

254
00:19:04,047 --> 00:19:05,742
Had the lowest mortality stats
in hospital.

255
00:19:05,815 --> 00:19:07,806
So would I if I took out tonsils.

256
00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:11,342
- Jack, my arrested lung's aphasic.
- You mean Richards? Shit.

257
00:19:11,421 --> 00:19:13,946
Obviously some damage from the
arrest. He must have had a stroke.

258
00:19:14,023 --> 00:19:16,821
Transfer him to Neurology.
No one dies in our service.

259
00:19:16,893 --> 00:19:21,330
I can't. I'm out. His wife fired me.
She's already phoned their lawyer...

260
00:19:21,397 --> 00:19:22,955
- How bad is he?
- Horrible.

261
00:19:23,032 --> 00:19:25,432
As of now, his speech is slurred,
he doesn't make any sense.

262
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:28,026
So he moves to Texas.

263
00:19:28,104 --> 00:19:30,538
And you wonder why I'm so uptight
about our malpractice insurance.

264
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:32,802
- It's never enough, you wait and see.
- Calm down.

265
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:34,867
You did a responsible procedure.

266
00:19:34,944 --> 00:19:37,913
Sure. If you sneeze in this place,
they slap a lawsuit on you.

267
00:19:37,981 --> 00:19:40,882
Jack. There's your ENT man.

268
00:19:42,018 --> 00:19:44,077
Ooh!

269
00:19:46,923 --> 00:19:49,221
- Who is she?
- That's Leslie Abbott.

270
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:54,252
- I think we're talking different talents.
- Absolutely not. She does great throat.

271
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,356
- Puh-lease.
- I'm serious.

272
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:04,435
- Is this for you, Jack?
- What?

273
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:07,135
He's been doing
a little coughing for months.

274
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,735
Well, if you won't see Leslie,
I'll check you out.

275
00:20:09,812 --> 00:20:12,838
- You're a gynecologist.
- So? Drop your pants.

276
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:21,585
Hello. Sorry to keep you waiting.
Busy day.

277
00:20:21,658 --> 00:20:25,389
- Jack MacKee.
- Hmm? Yes, I know. Have a seat.

278
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:27,452
Right.

279
00:20:31,334 --> 00:20:33,768
Murray Kaplan sends his best.

280
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:37,538
Oh, that's right.
You're in practice together?

281
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:40,132
Till we get it right.

282
00:20:44,747 --> 00:20:48,843
- So what seems to be the trouble?
- What?

283
00:20:51,321 --> 00:20:57,658
Nothing. I mean, I have... a tickle.
I've been hoarse.

284
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,628
- Mm-hmm.
- So...

285
00:21:00,697 --> 00:21:02,790
All right. Let's take a look.

286
00:21:02,865 --> 00:21:06,733
Uncross your knees. Back in the chair.
Sit up. Hands on your knees.

287
00:21:06,803 --> 00:21:10,967
Chin forward. And open.

288
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,032
Let's take a look. Close.

289
00:21:15,378 --> 00:21:18,313
Uh-huh. Open.

290
00:21:25,188 --> 00:21:27,179
Open.

291
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:51,174
All right. Open.

292
00:21:51,246 --> 00:21:53,305
This might be a little bitter.

293
00:21:56,585 --> 00:22:01,613
- That's an anesthetic.
- I want to take a closer look.

294
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,959
Whoa. A periscope!

295
00:22:06,595 --> 00:22:08,961
Won't be pleasant.

296
00:22:10,465 --> 00:22:12,456
Tongue out.

297
00:22:15,237 --> 00:22:21,073
All the way. And hold it... with your hand.

298
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:26,447
Head forward. And open.

299
00:22:26,515 --> 00:22:30,042
- And "E".
- E-E-E.

300
00:22:32,654 --> 00:22:37,682
- Again.
- E-E-E-E...

301
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:41,422
- Again.
- E-E-E-E...

302
00:22:41,496 --> 00:22:45,432
- Again.
- E-E-E-E...

303
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,129
- One more time.
- E-E-E-E...

304
00:22:49,204 --> 00:22:51,934
And that's all I need.

305
00:23:02,584 --> 00:23:05,883
Doctor, you have a growth.

306
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,892
What?

307
00:23:13,962 --> 00:23:18,023
A tumor. Laryngeal.
Here on the true vocal cord.

308
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,365
I know what "laryngeal" is.

309
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,776
We're gonna need chest X-rays,
blood chemistry,

310
00:23:28,844 --> 00:23:31,813
blood count, UA, EKG...

311
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,144
I'll have to check with my secretary,
but if it's remotely possible,

312
00:23:34,216 --> 00:23:38,710
I'd like to do a biopsy tomorrow. OK?

313
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:46,917
Thanks.

314
00:23:47,729 --> 00:23:49,788
Don't mention it.

315
00:24:02,878 --> 00:24:04,106
Hi.

316
00:24:06,815 --> 00:24:08,248
Hi.

317
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,753
You OK? I thought you had
a bypass tonight.

318
00:24:14,823 --> 00:24:18,554
His EKG wasn't so good.
We postponed.

319
00:24:18,627 --> 00:24:20,788
I'm fine.

320
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:27,600
So great! So we have
an evening together.

321
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:29,660
Yeah.

322
00:24:30,438 --> 00:24:34,875
- Yeah. I'll call Nicky. Nicky!
- Coming!

323
00:24:34,943 --> 00:24:37,605
- Say hi to your Dad!
- Oh, OK.

324
00:24:39,514 --> 00:24:44,975
Hi, Dad. Dad?
Mom, we got disconnected.

325
00:24:45,053 --> 00:24:49,786
- Oh! Hi, Dad!
- Special live appearance.

326
00:24:50,592 --> 00:24:53,755
- How're you doing?
- Pretty good.

327
00:24:53,828 --> 00:24:56,695
Your dad's home tonight.

328
00:25:41,543 --> 00:25:44,273
- What are you doing?
- Hi!

329
00:25:44,346 --> 00:25:46,337
Hi.

330
00:25:55,123 --> 00:25:57,250
So, tell me.

331
00:25:58,293 --> 00:26:00,693
There's nothing to tell.

332
00:26:00,762 --> 00:26:04,425
You know, the longer you don't tell me,
the more frightened I'm getting.

333
00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:07,161
Anne...

334
00:26:07,235 --> 00:26:11,399
What is it, Jack? What have they found?

335
00:26:11,473 --> 00:26:15,773
Huh? Have they found something?

336
00:26:17,177 --> 00:26:19,168
Yep!

337
00:26:27,554 --> 00:26:32,787
OK, so... we'll beat it.

338
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:35,354
- "We"?
- Mm-hmm.

339
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:42,562
'We" don't have it, Anne!

340
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:45,736
"We" don't have it!

341
00:26:45,806 --> 00:26:50,266
It's not a team game.

342
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:53,803
OK.

343
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,480
Why don't you come to bed?

344
00:27:44,365 --> 00:27:48,233
I have a biopsy tomorrow.
It's a laryngeal tumor.

345
00:27:48,302 --> 00:27:50,293
Oh, God.

346
00:27:56,377 --> 00:28:01,314
A doctor tells this man,
"You have a growth."

347
00:28:01,382 --> 00:28:05,682
Man says, "I demand a second opinion."

348
00:28:05,753 --> 00:28:12,181
Doctor says, "OK... and... you're ugly."

349
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:20,459
Oh, sweetheart.

350
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,166
Oh, baby...

351
00:28:34,782 --> 00:28:38,513
What am I doing sitting here
like one of the herd?

352
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,890
- Name?
- Dr. MacKee.

353
00:28:48,962 --> 00:28:50,987
- First name?
- Jack.

354
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:56,127
I've been an attending surgeon
on the staff of this hospital for 11 years.

355
00:28:59,106 --> 00:29:02,598
Then you should know
all about filling in forms.

356
00:29:02,676 --> 00:29:04,166
We've been sitting here for 30 minutes.

357
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:07,509
Why didn't she give us these
when we first arrived?

358
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:11,543
She should have.

359
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:19,785
MacKee!

360
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,385
- MacKee!
- Yeah.

361
00:29:23,697 --> 00:29:26,257
- Go home, Anne.
- No, I'll wait.

362
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:27,891
- Really, it's no big deal.
- But I want to...

363
00:29:27,968 --> 00:29:31,199
I'll call when I can manage a croak.

364
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:34,330
OK.

365
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:39,608
MacKee.

366
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,117
- I don't need a wheelchair.
- You have to sit in the chair.

367
00:29:44,184 --> 00:29:48,985
Listen. I know you. I'm Dr. MacKee.

368
00:29:49,056 --> 00:29:52,822
I don't need a chair.
I'm perfectly capable of walking.

369
00:29:52,893 --> 00:29:58,297
Please sit in the chair, Doctor.
If you fall over, the hospital is liable.

370
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:03,300
I don't fall over in hospitals.

371
00:30:18,852 --> 00:30:20,945
<i>I know that Dr. Abbott
has been a little delayed.</i>

372
00:30:21,021 --> 00:30:23,922
But we'd like you to undress, please.

373
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:27,518
Put on the gown you'll find on the bed.
They'll be down for you shortly.

374
00:30:27,594 --> 00:30:30,757
There's been a mistake.
This isn't a private room.

375
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:34,790
Yes, I'm afraid we don't have
any private rooms just at the moment.

376
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:40,932
- I'm not about to share a room.
- We don't have any private rooms.

377
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:44,876
I understand Dr. Abbott felt
this biopsy was urgent.

378
00:31:00,761 --> 00:31:02,752
Hey!

379
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:07,926
- Hey.
- Don't let her rattle you.

380
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,560
They want your bare butt hanging out

381
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:14,367
just so you don't get up
and bother them.

382
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,546
I'm Ralph. My bowels are all
screwed up. What are you in for?

383
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:31,082
Jack MacKee. Throat.

384
00:31:31,157 --> 00:31:33,955
What, your tongue,
your voice box, your tonsils?

385
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:36,324
There's a lot of software in there.

386
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:41,355
- Voice box.
- Oh, you poor bastard.

387
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:46,869
Your first time under the knife?

388
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:50,898
I bet you feel like you don't know
what's going on? Am I right?

389
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:53,571
Well, don't worry.
They don't know, either.

390
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:59,175
My doctor, the son of a bitch,
half the time he's lying to me.

391
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:03,415
And I can tell. I'm a cop.

392
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,392
What's your line?

393
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:13,663
I'm a doctor.

394
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:18,293
They're gonna cut you, doc?

395
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,301
Yeah.

396
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:32,410
Hey, Jack. How's it hanging?
Don't tell me, I can see for myself.

397
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:37,312
Hi. What's going on here?

398
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:40,621
The Ritz was full.

399
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:44,561
- What time are they doing you?
- When Madame shows up.

400
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,928
I spoke to her lawyer. He's very bullish.

401
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:50,332
He says you're the expert, so we need
you on the witness stand, OK?

402
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:53,236
- Don't go shuffling off to Buffalo just yet.
- But after that...

403
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:56,741
Sure, after that, do what you like.
I couldn't care less.

404
00:33:00,246 --> 00:33:04,376
You OK?
You want me to go in with you?

405
00:33:05,051 --> 00:33:08,487
I want you to go in instead of me.

406
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,998
- I did your bypass. Very clean.
- Great.

407
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:25,469
- I even played your closing music.
- Did Nancy sing?

408
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:33,037
- No, Nancy did not sing.
- That's good.

409
00:33:34,747 --> 00:33:38,080
Yeah, it's this one.

410
00:33:39,285 --> 00:33:41,150
She's never
gonna come back 100%.

411
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,279
I know.

412
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,346
Do you suppose you could get me
a thinner sheet?

413
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:48,882
I'm not sure everyone
can see through this one.

414
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,129
It must be some sort of a shunt.

415
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:57,726
What do you think
of those blood gasses?

416
00:33:57,803 --> 00:33:59,668
- She's hypoxic.
- I know.

417
00:33:59,739 --> 00:34:02,435
But I saw the chest today
and the atelectasis is almost gone.

418
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:03,634
There's something else going on.

419
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:08,373
Does she have a murmur? You could be
dealing with an Eisenmenger Syndrome.

420
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:11,746
Yes, it talks! Amazing!

421
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:17,088
I have the radiographic video.
You wanna take a look at it?

422
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:19,420
- Yeah.
- Who's the internist?

423
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:20,891
Oh, hey, hey, Barry,
I've been looking for you.

424
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,590
- So?
- I was late. It was very late.

425
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,527
Good morning.
Everything all right there?

426
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:36,803
- Now you're gonna feel a little prick.
- Please, Doctor, we've only just met.

427
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:50,283
Looks like a sweet dream.

428
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:54,850
Huh? Now, just keep dreaming.
Don't wake up.

429
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:58,454
There's no need for you
to wake up, OK? Keep dreaming.

430
00:34:58,531 --> 00:35:01,329
We're just gonna roll you over
on your side. Come on.

431
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,426
Help me out. Help me out. Help me out.

432
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:08,496
Nice. You just stay there for me.

433
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:20,412
Hey! Mr. Brown, relax.
Mr. Brown, relax, man.

434
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:24,946
Hey, hey! Just relax, don't strain.
Keep dreaming.

435
00:35:25,024 --> 00:35:29,051
Mr. Brown, you know you're scheduled
for a barium enema.

436
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:33,292
Relax. It's just an enema! Now breathe.

437
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:36,901
Just tell Mr. Jaconelli
Dr. MacKee's wife called

438
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:40,302
and that I expect him to get back
to me personally about this, OK?

439
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:42,636
Right. Thank you.

440
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,613
I'm Leslie Abbott.

441
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,413
Jack? Jack, honey. Dr. Abbott's here.

442
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,446
Hi.

443
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,758
I'm sorry. I understand
there was some confusion

444
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,260
regarding beds and procedures.

445
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,194
Yeah.

446
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:11,201
I hope you biopsied my throat
and not my colon.

447
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,497
I'm sorry.

448
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,673
So, did Path throw the I Ching?

449
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,675
The tumor is malignant.

450
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:40,325
The tumor is malignant.

451
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:49,505
It's a T-2 lesion.
You're welcome to a second opinion.

452
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:52,270
No. One enema's enough for any tumor.

453
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:55,710
- How will you treat it?
- I'm recommending radiation therapy.

454
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,874
I want it cut out.

455
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,817
Radiation will reduce the mass
for this kind of tumor,

456
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,616
and we got a high cure rate.
80% or better.

457
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,089
And if I have to cut,
I risk losing the voice.

458
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:22,405
- Do you know a good radiation man?
- Clark Kent.

459
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,008
Charlie Reed is terrific.

460
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,309
You could meet with him, get an MR

461
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:33,248
and they could start fitting you
for treatment as of tomorrow.

462
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,684
What time tomorrow?

463
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:40,247
I have open heart scheduled
for tomorrow.

464
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:46,327
Dr. MacKee... you've got cancer.

465
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,934
Tomorrow's great. Thanks.

466
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,664
I've signed you out. I think you're gonna
be more comfortable in your own bed.

467
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:59,677
And you shouldn't be talking.
OK, we'll see you later.

468
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:15,892
- I can do it.
- OK.

469
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,259
Honey, listen, just...

470
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:22,791
bring the car around, OK?

471
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,858
OK.

472
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,646
Dr. MacKee?

473
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:56,390
I just heard. Did they get
the biopsy results back yet?

474
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:01,164
Yeah. It's positive.

475
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,608
How'd you hear?
Did they post it in the men's room?

476
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,544
No.

477
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,649
Come on, I'll walk down with you.

478
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,189
I'm fine, thank you. I'll be just fine.

479
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,763
I feel like having a cigarette.

480
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:38,106
I have a tumor, my throat feels
like shit, and I want a cigarette.

481
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:40,634
Yeah.

482
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:45,539
We should have come
in the red lobster.

483
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:48,176
This car always makes you depressed.

484
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:58,961
We're laughing. They cut my throat
and we're laughing. Can you believe it?

485
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:13,944
I couldn't bear it if...

486
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:33,994
Better.

487
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:36,624
Not better.

488
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,568
We'll strip it down
on the weekend. Nicky?

489
00:40:41,638 --> 00:40:45,665
- Max is waiting.
- Yeah.

490
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:49,075
Your mother told you
I had a test yesterday?

491
00:40:50,413 --> 00:40:51,641
Yeah.

492
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:55,310
Well, it turns out I've got a growth,

493
00:40:55,385 --> 00:41:00,015
a lesion in my throat which is...

494
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,189
not great.

495
00:41:05,595 --> 00:41:08,792
But it's the kind of tumor
which responds well to radiation,

496
00:41:08,865 --> 00:41:11,493
which is great. Which is...

497
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:17,463
It... it's pretty great.

498
00:41:22,412 --> 00:41:26,314
- Dad, I gotta go.
- OK.

499
00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:43,350
This MRI examination
takes about 40 minutes.

500
00:42:43,426 --> 00:42:48,022
And it's very important that you don't
move at all during that time.

501
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:54,261
- Are you claustrophobic?
- Only in cramped spaces.

502
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:09,015
I just filled in all these forms.
I don't get this.

503
00:43:09,085 --> 00:43:11,952
Why don't you get this stuff from
Radiology? It's 50 feet down the hall.

504
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:14,718
I know. I'm sorry.
It's the same for everybody.

505
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:17,885
- We have to have our own records.
- Yeah, but...

506
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:19,292
- Hi.
- Great hat.

507
00:43:19,362 --> 00:43:21,125
- Thanks.
- Hello. Radiation Therapy,

508
00:43:21,197 --> 00:43:24,758
Laurie speaking. No. Yes.

509
00:43:25,802 --> 00:43:28,396
Yes.

510
00:43:28,471 --> 00:43:33,101
Wait till you see the disclaimer
forms. They deliver them in a truck.

511
00:43:34,077 --> 00:43:36,637
- Uh-huh. Let me have a look.
- Um...

512
00:43:36,713 --> 00:43:38,840
I'll be right with you.

513
00:43:38,915 --> 00:43:42,248
Let me call you back once I've located it.

514
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,688
Well, you know, busy. Yeah.
What seems to be the problem?

515
00:43:46,756 --> 00:43:48,451
I don't wanna pull rank,
but I don't know if you realize

516
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,322
I'm an attending surgeon at this hospital.

517
00:43:50,393 --> 00:43:53,157
I knew that, Doctor, yes.

518
00:43:53,229 --> 00:43:56,858
OK, good. So you'll appreciate
when I say I have patients of my own

519
00:43:56,933 --> 00:43:58,525
who are waiting for me
while I'm waiting for you,

520
00:43:58,601 --> 00:44:00,501
which is why I mention
I'm not looking for VIP...

521
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:03,232
You know, the pity is
you were late getting here, so...

522
00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:06,207
Hang on! I was not late getting here.
Radiology was late with my MRI.

523
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:08,267
I was not...

524
00:44:09,412 --> 00:44:13,712
Please don't
make me strain my voice.

525
00:44:13,783 --> 00:44:16,343
- Dr. MacKee?
- Yeah.

526
00:44:16,419 --> 00:44:18,512
I'm Charles Reed.

527
00:44:18,588 --> 00:44:20,954
- Oh.
- Come in.

528
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:35,760
- How we doing?
- Super.

529
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,330
Sit down.

530
00:44:38,408 --> 00:44:40,740
No, I've been sitting.

531
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:44,507
Dr. MacKee, my feeling - for what it's
worth - if we're going to treat you,

532
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:49,041
you're going to meet the team here
every day for the next six weeks.

533
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,108
And?

534
00:44:50,186 --> 00:44:52,177
I don't know what it's like
at the top of this building,

535
00:44:52,255 --> 00:44:54,723
but down here, we try to be civil.

536
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:56,452
Oh, well, upstairs we're very hostile.

537
00:44:56,526 --> 00:45:00,826
We meet our patients, we come
right out and tell them our feelings...

538
00:45:00,897 --> 00:45:03,263
for what they're worth.

539
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,561
OK.

540
00:45:04,634 --> 00:45:09,799
So... we're not gonna fall in love.
What else do I need to know?

541
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,740
Your chest is clear.

542
00:45:12,809 --> 00:45:14,800
We'll get the MRI from tomorrow
and get started

543
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,312
assuming there's no spread
to the lymph nodes.

544
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:20,747
And the rest of this visit,
we'll fit you up for treatment.

545
00:45:20,816 --> 00:45:23,148
Good.

546
00:45:23,218 --> 00:45:26,187
And if the lymph nodes show positive?

547
00:45:26,255 --> 00:45:30,055
I'll discuss a different treatment
with Dr. Abbott.

548
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,624
And me.

549
00:45:35,564 --> 00:45:38,055
Yeah, sure.

550
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,365
Watch your step. Through here.

551
00:45:47,443 --> 00:45:52,346
If we can just have you come around
on this side... and hop up on here

552
00:45:52,414 --> 00:45:55,577
and lie so your head faces that way.

553
00:45:55,651 --> 00:45:57,642
Careful.

554
00:46:00,022 --> 00:46:03,719
Your last guest stole the bed linen.

555
00:46:13,769 --> 00:46:15,669
Here, we're gonna put
your wrists in the straps.

556
00:46:15,737 --> 00:46:19,833
When I ask you to,
I want you to pull up really hard. OK?

557
00:46:21,643 --> 00:46:25,101
Head down. OK, and pull.

558
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:38,651
- What are you doing?
- Just marking the target.

559
00:46:38,727 --> 00:46:43,596
- OK. This mark'll come off.
- Hey, it's nothing to worry about.

560
00:46:43,665 --> 00:46:47,465
We just need to take a film and make
sure we're hitting the right spot.

561
00:46:54,276 --> 00:46:56,744
- What are you doing?
- We're just making a mask of your head

562
00:46:56,812 --> 00:47:00,578
in this position, all right? It's real fast.

563
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:05,510
All right.

564
00:47:19,368 --> 00:47:21,336
...for an hour already.
- I understand. I'm sorry.

565
00:47:21,403 --> 00:47:24,304
- Great. Finally! Dr. Taylor...
- I know, I know.

566
00:47:24,373 --> 00:47:27,308
- Just give me five minutes.
- Doctor...

567
00:47:27,376 --> 00:47:30,743
Hello, Mrs. Arcari.
We'll be right with you.

568
00:47:35,751 --> 00:47:37,150
Oh, man.

569
00:47:39,988 --> 00:47:43,822
- Hey, partner.
- Hi.

570
00:47:44,459 --> 00:47:47,622
God, Jack, you look like shit.
Is this the radiation?

571
00:47:47,696 --> 00:47:52,360
- No, this is nearly the radiation.
- What are you doing here?

572
00:47:52,434 --> 00:47:56,165
I have a room full of patients.

573
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:59,908
What about the valve job later?
What's his name?

574
00:47:59,975 --> 00:48:02,307
Choy. That'll be fine.

575
00:48:02,377 --> 00:48:04,607
I wouldn't want you
cutting my heart today.

576
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,342
I told you, I'll be fine.

577
00:48:09,184 --> 00:48:11,379
Jack, we had a talk this morning.
Nobody planned...

578
00:48:11,453 --> 00:48:15,048
- "We"? Who's "we"?
- Pete, Ed, me. The practice.

579
00:48:15,123 --> 00:48:19,992
No. Pete, Ed, you and me
is the practice!

580
00:48:20,062 --> 00:48:23,498
Gosh, wherever I go these days,
I'm getting cut out of the talk.

581
00:48:23,565 --> 00:48:27,262
- What?
- So...

582
00:48:30,439 --> 00:48:32,771
What did "we" talk about?

583
00:48:34,109 --> 00:48:36,805
Jack, you're sick. Stay home.

584
00:48:36,878 --> 00:48:40,507
Stay home a week, two weeks,
three weeks, whatever it takes.

585
00:48:40,582 --> 00:48:43,380
- I don't want to stay home.
- Annie called me. She's worried as hell.

586
00:48:43,452 --> 00:48:46,910
- I don't wanna stay home!
- OK.

587
00:48:47,723 --> 00:48:51,318
What we don't want to happen, buddy...

588
00:48:51,393 --> 00:48:54,885
is to start canceling surgery time,
missing appointments,

589
00:48:54,963 --> 00:48:57,261
losing ground on the stats, that's all.

590
00:48:57,332 --> 00:49:01,200
From tomorrow,
I have 15 minutes' treatment a day.

591
00:49:01,269 --> 00:49:03,362
- Sure, Jack.
- 15 minutes in six weeks,

592
00:49:03,438 --> 00:49:06,737
that's it, it's gone.
So let's go back to work.

593
00:49:06,808 --> 00:49:09,470
And can everybody wipe that caring look
off their face! Is that possible?

594
00:49:09,544 --> 00:49:12,104
Because it's a royal pain!

595
00:49:21,857 --> 00:49:24,519
Come on, Carrie, let's go.

596
00:49:37,706 --> 00:49:41,699
- Ow! Ow! What are you doing?
- I'm just giving you a tiny tattoo.

597
00:49:41,777 --> 00:49:43,108
What? You're what?

598
00:49:43,178 --> 00:49:45,976
Nice and still now.
These are gonna be permanent marks.

599
00:49:47,949 --> 00:49:49,974
Shouldn't there be a lead apron?

600
00:49:50,052 --> 00:49:54,284
Oh, no. The beam is focused
on your larynx, doc. You don't need it.

601
00:49:55,824 --> 00:49:58,019
But can we have the apron
anyway though, please?

602
00:49:58,093 --> 00:50:03,030
Really, you don't need it, doc.
But, don't move.

603
00:50:26,787 --> 00:50:30,188
- I don't wanna wear kneepads.
- You've got to wear 'em.

604
00:50:31,659 --> 00:50:36,926
- Anybody need a doctor?
- Yes.

605
00:50:40,534 --> 00:50:43,094
It's an abrasion. Leave it open.

606
00:50:48,509 --> 00:50:50,670
- Good day?
- Great.

607
00:50:50,745 --> 00:50:54,738
I thought to myself, "What the hell?"
I went out and I got drunk,

608
00:50:54,815 --> 00:50:57,978
and decided to have myself tattooed.

609
00:50:58,052 --> 00:51:00,486
What do you think?

610
00:51:00,554 --> 00:51:03,955
That's where they shoot the X-rays.

611
00:51:07,361 --> 00:51:09,386
Dr. Reed's not here yet?

612
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,758
Oh.

613
00:51:17,371 --> 00:51:22,434
- Um...
- Oh, thank you so much.

614
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:25,343
I'm not doing so well today.

615
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,848
Hi.

616
00:51:27,915 --> 00:51:33,182
Sit down. I'm leaving anyway.
Thank you.

617
00:51:33,254 --> 00:51:37,657
Oh, Dr. MacKee. I'm sorry.
Dr. Reed can't be here this morning.

618
00:51:37,725 --> 00:51:40,751
No. No. Why not?

619
00:51:40,828 --> 00:51:44,093
He's been held up. I think there's
some admin meeting all day today.

620
00:51:44,165 --> 00:51:46,292
- When do I see him?
- He'll be here next week.

621
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:49,928
No, look it, if I can't see him today,
I'll see him tomorrow!

622
00:51:50,004 --> 00:51:51,733
- We're closed weekends.
- Laurie?

623
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:53,000
I'll be right there, Carol.

624
00:51:53,073 --> 00:51:55,598
I was told this was
to be a daily treatment.

625
00:51:55,676 --> 00:51:58,406
Well, I'm sorry. I don't make the rules.
I'm sure that...

626
00:51:58,479 --> 00:52:00,879
Why don't we from now on,
in this hospital,

627
00:52:00,948 --> 00:52:04,748
we should drop "I'm sorry"
from conversation, OK?

628
00:52:04,819 --> 00:52:07,652
Let's just assume
it begins every sentence.

629
00:52:07,721 --> 00:52:09,882
"I'm sorry, the doctor
can't see you today",

630
00:52:09,957 --> 00:52:11,822
"I'm sorry you have
to fill in another form",

631
00:52:11,892 --> 00:52:15,589
"I'm sorry we gave you
the wrong treatment."

632
00:52:15,663 --> 00:52:18,427
What do we think?

633
00:52:27,408 --> 00:52:30,775
There's not much point
shouting at Laurie.

634
00:52:33,447 --> 00:52:36,939
- Excuse me?
- She's just doing her job.

635
00:52:37,017 --> 00:52:39,247
If you want to shout,
go shout at a doctor.

636
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:43,381
- I am a doctor.
- Not when you're sitting here.

637
00:52:44,525 --> 00:52:47,824
- How come you're so calm?
- Who?

638
00:52:47,895 --> 00:52:50,193
You. You seem to be taking it so well.

639
00:52:52,433 --> 00:52:56,927
No. I have a grade four brain tumor.

640
00:52:57,004 --> 00:53:02,909
It took my doctors three months to
find it. I didn't take that so well at all.

641
00:53:07,314 --> 00:53:09,214
Actually, they didn't find it.

642
00:53:09,283 --> 00:53:14,687
I rear-ended a few cars,
fell over, blacked out.

643
00:53:14,755 --> 00:53:17,553
Short of the tumor
jumping out and singing,

644
00:53:17,625 --> 00:53:20,560
there was nothing else it could do
to get recognized.

645
00:53:20,628 --> 00:53:24,394
See, now I'd call that negligence,
wouldn't you?

646
00:53:24,465 --> 00:53:28,868
Well, that's-that's...
it's difficult to comment.

647
00:53:29,837 --> 00:53:34,797
Oh, yeah. It's a club, isn't it? I forgot.

648
00:53:38,345 --> 00:53:43,078
- Did you get tests?
- Sure.

649
00:53:43,717 --> 00:53:49,417
- What?
- CAT scan... two.

650
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:51,583
Of course that was way down the track,

651
00:53:51,659 --> 00:53:55,459
after they gave me aspirin
and sent me home.

652
00:53:55,529 --> 00:54:00,990
Oh, and then what?
There was stress management.

653
00:54:01,068 --> 00:54:05,698
Yeah. Oh, and then traffic school.
That was really helpful.

654
00:54:10,611 --> 00:54:15,571
My father had a patient.
Same diagnosis, grade four.

655
00:54:15,649 --> 00:54:18,243
He has grandchildren now.

656
00:54:20,087 --> 00:54:24,114
- Are you serious?
- Sure.

657
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:31,054
- June. Let's do it.
- That's me. June.

658
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,962
See you later, June.

659
00:54:36,036 --> 00:54:38,903
You look good today, June.

660
00:54:45,112 --> 00:54:46,977
- I'll check it.
- Thanks, Walter.

661
00:54:47,047 --> 00:54:49,345
- Anytime.
- Murray, do me a favor, will ya?

662
00:54:49,415 --> 00:54:53,977
Call Radiology and ask them
for the results of my MRI.

663
00:54:54,053 --> 00:54:57,887
- Doesn't Leslie have them?
- I can't get her. I can't get Reed.

664
00:54:57,957 --> 00:55:00,551
And I can't wait any longer.

665
00:55:00,626 --> 00:55:01,991
They ought to release them
to you straight off.

666
00:55:02,061 --> 00:55:06,691
I mean, I don't know what you think
I'm going to accomplish.

667
00:55:06,766 --> 00:55:09,098
Hi. Who's this?

668
00:55:09,168 --> 00:55:12,626
Hey, Joanne, Murray Kaplan.
How you doing?

669
00:55:12,705 --> 00:55:17,574
Good. Listen, do me a favor, Joanne.
Pull me an MR file, would you?

670
00:55:17,643 --> 00:55:22,444
Jack MacKee. Capital "M", capital "K".

671
00:55:22,515 --> 00:55:27,179
No. No, it's Leslie Abbott's.

672
00:55:27,253 --> 00:55:32,156
No, I know that, Joanne. Sure...

673
00:55:32,225 --> 00:55:36,992
Hello, this is Dr. MacKee
and this is my file.

674
00:55:38,031 --> 00:55:42,764
No, it's not my patient.
It's in my name. I'm the patient.

675
00:55:44,103 --> 00:55:46,367
No, you do not need
to clear it with anybody.

676
00:55:46,439 --> 00:55:48,168
You just go now, open the file

677
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:51,608
and tell me if it shows any spread
to the lymph nodes.

678
00:55:51,677 --> 00:55:53,668
Thank you.

679
00:55:55,214 --> 00:55:56,806
Dr. MacKee. We're ready in one.

680
00:55:56,883 --> 00:55:59,044
We'll be right with you.

681
00:56:05,191 --> 00:56:08,854
Thank you. Thank you, I appreciate that.

682
00:56:11,364 --> 00:56:15,300
- Zero spread.
- Oh, thank God! Oh, God!

683
00:56:20,506 --> 00:56:24,033
Dr. Blumfield...

684
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:29,844
This is the ghost
of a thousand murdered tonsils.

685
00:56:29,916 --> 00:56:31,941
Put us back...

686
00:56:32,018 --> 00:56:38,821
Dr. Eli! This is your
tongue depressor - lick me!

687
00:57:05,852 --> 00:57:08,821
Hi.

688
00:57:10,256 --> 00:57:12,247
Anne!

689
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,560
Anne!

690
00:57:16,629 --> 00:57:18,620
Nick!

691
00:57:42,288 --> 00:57:46,452
Well, hello. Chicken or sausage?

692
00:57:46,526 --> 00:57:51,964
Uh, hi. What are you doing out here?

693
00:57:52,031 --> 00:57:57,094
I'm celebrating. No spread
to the lymph nodes. They're clear.

694
00:57:58,137 --> 00:58:00,765
- What?
- Yeah.

695
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:06,437
Oh, my God, that's wonderful.
That's, um...

696
00:58:07,413 --> 00:58:11,406
- Oh, thank God!
- Yeah, I thought so.

697
00:58:11,484 --> 00:58:14,044
So join the party.
Have a piece of sausage.

698
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:18,420
Oh, no, no. I'm... I've eaten.

699
00:58:19,926 --> 00:58:21,917
OK.

700
00:58:22,695 --> 00:58:26,096
- Where's Nicky?
- He's sleeping over with Max.

701
00:58:26,165 --> 00:58:29,532
Great. Doesn't this smell great?

702
00:58:29,602 --> 00:58:32,036
Jack, are you angry about something?

703
00:58:32,104 --> 00:58:34,971
You know, I always work late
on Friday nights.

704
00:58:35,041 --> 00:58:40,240
- Sure. Do these look burnt?
- I mean, if I'd known...

705
00:58:40,947 --> 00:58:43,245
But, I didn't even know
you were expecting this news.

706
00:58:43,316 --> 00:58:46,444
Why didn't you tell me?

707
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:49,420
You should've called me. I would have...

708
00:58:51,023 --> 00:58:54,891
Let's go inside.

709
00:58:56,262 --> 00:59:00,198
- Aren't you cold?
- Yeah, you are cold.

710
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:09,364
Will you just tell me
how you want me to be, Jack?

711
00:59:09,442 --> 00:59:12,502
OK? Because I never know these days.

712
00:59:12,578 --> 00:59:16,912
Really. Like, like, like, what are we now?
Are we happy, are we not happy?

713
00:59:16,983 --> 00:59:22,182
Are we close, not close?
Please just tell me, I'll be there.

714
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:35,254
Well, this is quality time.

715
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:40,126
Why couldn't they send us the new IDs
through the mail? Do we know?

716
00:59:40,802 --> 00:59:45,034
Tell them you're a big doctor. Cut in line.

717
00:59:47,842 --> 00:59:50,902
Are you angry with me?

718
00:59:50,979 --> 00:59:53,880
You lied to me.

719
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:57,845
What?

720
00:59:57,919 --> 01:00:02,947
My tumor. I see it giving me
certain freedoms I never allowed myself.

721
01:00:03,691 --> 01:00:06,592
Yeah, like being incredibly hostile.

722
01:00:07,528 --> 01:00:12,056
Like being honest and expecting
people around me to do the same.

723
01:00:12,133 --> 01:00:15,591
What did I lie about for Christ's sake?

724
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:20,607
I'm dying. Please don't waste my time.

725
01:00:23,311 --> 01:00:26,439
- Miss Ellis.
- Thank you.

726
01:00:26,514 --> 01:00:28,505
Your card.

727
01:00:31,486 --> 01:00:36,446
They should've found your tumor.
You were right. Somebody screwed up.

728
01:00:37,191 --> 01:00:39,853
You should've had an MRI.

729
01:00:43,665 --> 01:00:45,758
But the system stinks.

730
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:50,497
Insurance companies tell us
what tests we can and cannot do.

731
01:00:50,571 --> 01:00:55,702
An MRI, which I know
would have found your tumor...

732
01:00:57,545 --> 01:01:01,538
costs about $1,000.

733
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:20,893
It's appalling.

734
01:01:21,936 --> 01:01:25,497
And what about your father's patient?

735
01:01:30,678 --> 01:01:33,408
The one who recovered?

736
01:01:40,788 --> 01:01:43,052
There was no patient.

737
01:01:51,232 --> 01:01:53,223
OK.

738
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,165
Just don't lie to me again.

739
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:07,170
OK.

740
01:02:08,783 --> 01:02:12,275
One, two, three, four. One...

741
01:02:14,455 --> 01:02:16,980
You wanna try? Show him how to do it.

742
01:02:17,058 --> 01:02:19,891
- Pretty amazing.
- I'm not that bad.

743
01:02:19,961 --> 01:02:21,952
I got a date.

744
01:02:23,064 --> 01:02:26,363
- Great.
- No, I wish.

745
01:02:26,434 --> 01:02:30,097
In court. So we got to get
our stories straight.

746
01:02:30,171 --> 01:02:32,605
What stories? Alan, who's first?

747
01:02:32,673 --> 01:02:38,236
- The terminal in 1217.
- Terminal?

748
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,713
What terminal? Bus terminal?

749
01:02:41,783 --> 01:02:47,244
No... the dying patient in 1217.

750
01:02:47,321 --> 01:02:50,256
What's the patient's name?

751
01:02:51,492 --> 01:02:54,586
- Jay-Jay?
- Mr. Winter.

752
01:02:54,662 --> 01:02:59,156
OK, now Mr. Winter
is either alive or dead.

753
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:05,001
So, is Mr. Winter alive,
or should we advise the morgue?

754
01:03:06,674 --> 01:03:11,407
Call another patient "terminal" and that's
how you'll describe your career!

755
01:03:17,385 --> 01:03:20,149
What room is he in?

756
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:14,570
Barbara died.

757
01:04:16,611 --> 01:04:19,876
The older woman with the knitting.

758
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,415
She didn't wake up this morning.

759
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:55,109
- What are you thinking?
- I don't know.

760
01:04:57,484 --> 01:05:01,511
That Barbara had been knitting
that big shawl for her granddaughter

761
01:05:01,588 --> 01:05:06,992
for months... and she finished it.

762
01:05:09,963 --> 01:05:15,765
And I've never been to London...

763
01:05:15,835 --> 01:05:18,804
or Italy.

764
01:05:21,841 --> 01:05:25,106
I never had a baby.

765
01:05:27,213 --> 01:05:30,774
I never learned to use chopsticks.

766
01:05:31,585 --> 01:05:36,022
And I had a front-row ticket

767
01:05:36,089 --> 01:05:41,652
to see the American Indian Dance
Theater. They were touring here.

768
01:05:41,728 --> 01:05:43,127
God, I've always wanted to see them.

769
01:05:43,196 --> 01:05:46,859
You know, they have
these great costumes.

770
01:05:49,336 --> 01:05:52,305
And I was in this place.

771
01:05:53,673 --> 01:05:55,664
So...

772
01:05:57,477 --> 01:06:01,436
It's just one more thing to add to my list.

773
01:06:02,415 --> 01:06:04,781
They'll be back.

774
01:06:05,619 --> 01:06:08,144
In six months.

775
01:07:05,311 --> 01:07:08,940
Mr. Maris, any questions?

776
01:07:09,015 --> 01:07:13,748
You know, Doctor... it seems strange.

777
01:07:15,355 --> 01:07:19,689
There's somebody out there
alive, walking around...

778
01:07:21,628 --> 01:07:24,859
Then something terrible will happen,
and they'll die.

779
01:07:30,737 --> 01:07:35,265
Then I'll have their heart.
I think about that.

780
01:07:35,809 --> 01:07:37,800
Yep.

781
01:07:38,978 --> 01:07:42,038
So, we wait.

782
01:07:42,115 --> 01:07:47,052
It may take a little while
before we have a heart to harvest.

783
01:07:48,888 --> 01:07:51,186
I know.

784
01:07:51,257 --> 01:07:54,954
Mr. Maris, it's always a good idea
to set your affairs in order.

785
01:07:56,362 --> 01:07:59,889
My affairs are in order.

786
01:08:01,568 --> 01:08:03,559
Good.

787
01:08:04,704 --> 01:08:07,229
I have confidence in you.

788
01:08:11,945 --> 01:08:13,412
OK.

789
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,911
Thank you.

790
01:08:38,905 --> 01:08:40,896
Dr. MacKee.

791
01:08:45,278 --> 01:08:47,940
I want you to have another MRI.

792
01:08:49,182 --> 01:08:53,118
- Really? Why?
- Your exams were not what we'd like.

793
01:08:53,186 --> 01:08:56,280
I spoke to Dr. Abbott, she agreed.

794
01:08:56,356 --> 01:09:00,315
We'll do the MRI, and then I think
you should talk with her.

795
01:09:00,393 --> 01:09:02,918
What do you mean,
"Not what we'd like"?

796
01:09:03,763 --> 01:09:07,494
We had hoped to be seeing
some reduction in the tumor by now.

797
01:09:07,566 --> 01:09:09,557
We haven't.

798
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:14,634
I'm sorry.

799
01:09:26,118 --> 01:09:28,109
Come on.

800
01:09:38,897 --> 01:09:42,162
I came up here when they finally
diagnosed my tumor.

801
01:09:46,438 --> 01:09:49,965
I thought I'd throw myself over the edge.

802
01:09:50,042 --> 01:09:53,102
God, I was so...

803
01:09:53,178 --> 01:09:58,946
I felt... like my skin was coming off.

804
01:09:59,818 --> 01:10:03,276
Oh, I screamed and screamed and...

805
01:10:04,990 --> 01:10:10,360
There was... there was this bird
perched right over there.

806
01:10:11,063 --> 01:10:16,126
And it just looks at me real strange,

807
01:10:16,201 --> 01:10:21,161
like "Lady, what is your problem?"

808
01:10:25,143 --> 01:10:29,842
And I laughed.
I felt so stupid that I just...

809
01:10:31,149 --> 01:10:33,549
laughed out loud.

810
01:10:35,787 --> 01:10:37,778
You know what?

811
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:42,120
I think it was an angel.

812
01:10:51,403 --> 01:10:54,236
Go ahead and scream.
No one can hear you.

813
01:10:59,945 --> 01:11:02,277
I don't wanna scream.

814
01:11:03,181 --> 01:11:08,744
- Go ahead and jump.
- I don't wanna jump.

815
01:11:11,256 --> 01:11:15,317
Then fight it. Fight it!

816
01:11:31,877 --> 01:11:37,645
That tour, that tour...
is that still happening?

817
01:11:37,716 --> 01:11:41,846
- What tour?
- The Indians, the dancers.

818
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,582
- I think so.
- Good.

819
01:11:44,656 --> 01:11:46,590
If they're in New York, we're in trouble.

820
01:11:46,658 --> 01:11:49,923
But we might find
they're just down the block.

821
01:11:49,995 --> 01:11:55,831
- I can't do that. I can't go.
- I'll take care of it. It's my treat.

822
01:11:55,901 --> 01:11:58,768
No, no, no. It's not that. It's just...

823
01:11:58,837 --> 01:12:03,672
Excuse me, is this my intrepid friend
or not? We're going!

824
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:07,310
Come on.

825
01:12:07,379 --> 01:12:11,076
Wait, this is crazy. Look at me.
I'm not dressed for a...

826
01:12:11,149 --> 01:12:15,518
You look great. OK, Carrie,
call me back when you know.

827
01:12:15,587 --> 01:12:20,581
- Hi. Winnemucca?
- Nevada.

828
01:12:20,659 --> 01:12:24,720
We fly to Reno, we drive
for two hours into the desert.

829
01:12:24,796 --> 01:12:27,390
OK, what do we need?
We need two tickets to Reno, a car,

830
01:12:27,466 --> 01:12:29,457
and two tickets to the concert.

831
01:12:29,534 --> 01:12:32,264
No, it's for me and a Miss June Ellis.

832
01:12:32,337 --> 01:12:36,171
You got that?
Thanks, Carrie, you're great.

833
01:12:38,343 --> 01:12:41,870
Can you just pickup and go like this?

834
01:12:44,549 --> 01:12:48,610
"I see my tumor giving me certain
freedoms I never allowed myself."

835
01:12:54,559 --> 01:13:00,498
I had a strange,
wonderful dream last night.

836
01:13:01,533 --> 01:13:08,234
I flew right over your house
with a full head of hair.

837
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:24,014
I love that song.

838
01:13:47,112 --> 01:13:51,071
- Can we stop?
- You mean, take a break or...?

839
01:13:51,148 --> 01:13:53,981
No, I mean, just stop.

840
01:13:54,785 --> 01:13:58,585
OK, I just... I'm a little nervous
about missing the concert, the Indians.

841
01:13:58,656 --> 01:14:04,151
Jack... it wasn't the concert.

842
01:14:04,895 --> 01:14:07,796
It's the time.

843
01:14:07,865 --> 01:14:12,097
It's rushing past me.

844
01:14:12,169 --> 01:14:15,002
I don't wanna rush past this.

845
01:14:15,072 --> 01:14:20,135
I don't wanna rush past
anything anymore. I can't.

846
01:14:20,878 --> 01:14:23,506
I just can't, Jack.

847
01:14:25,049 --> 01:14:27,813
Anything. Anything you want.

848
01:14:30,087 --> 01:14:32,954
I'm sorry
for dragging you out here.

849
01:14:34,558 --> 01:14:39,461
"Get in, fix it, get out."

850
01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:42,328
That's what I tell my residents.

851
01:14:43,067 --> 01:14:46,798
She missed her concert,
take her to the concert.

852
01:14:51,809 --> 01:14:56,769
You know what's special to me, Jack?
I mean, truly special?

853
01:14:59,683 --> 01:15:01,674
This.

854
01:15:04,989 --> 01:15:06,980
This.

855
01:15:13,497 --> 01:15:15,488
Now.

856
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:26,938
Do you pray, June?
Is that what holds you together?

857
01:15:28,412 --> 01:15:30,846
Oh, I pray.

858
01:15:34,251 --> 01:15:36,412
I meditate.

859
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:39,419
I eat chocolate.

860
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:45,528
I go dancing.

861
01:18:52,849 --> 01:18:55,875
<i>- Hello?
- Anne, did I wake you?</i>

862
01:18:55,952 --> 01:19:01,584
Oh, God. Jack, where are you?

863
01:19:02,158 --> 01:19:06,891
I don't know. I'm in the desert,
in a phone booth

864
01:19:06,963 --> 01:19:08,988
somewhere between Reno and home.

865
01:19:09,065 --> 01:19:15,004
Why? What are you doing, Jack, huh?

866
01:19:15,071 --> 01:19:20,168
I went a little crazy. I'm OK.
I'll explain in the morning.

867
01:19:20,243 --> 01:19:22,973
No, no, no, no. Tell me now.

868
01:19:23,045 --> 01:19:26,742
<i>- I can't.
- Just tell me, OK?</i>

869
01:19:30,219 --> 01:19:35,020
<i>- I don't think the radiation is working.
- Oh. God...</i>

870
01:19:36,459 --> 01:19:40,896
<i>- They don't seem to think it's working.
- Oh. Sweetheart.</i>

871
01:19:40,963 --> 01:19:43,329
Let me come and get you.

872
01:19:45,468 --> 01:19:51,634
<i>- I'm with a fellow patient.
- Oh...</i>

873
01:19:51,707 --> 01:19:53,834
She's a friend, Anne.

874
01:19:55,445 --> 01:19:59,245
<i>She has a brain tumor.</i>

875
01:20:00,049 --> 01:20:03,644
<i>Oh. I missed the plane.</i>

876
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:06,586
I'll be home in the morning.

877
01:20:06,656 --> 01:20:10,148
<i>Good night. Jack.</i>

878
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:08,376
- I'm late.
- Anne, can we meet?

879
01:21:08,451 --> 01:21:11,909
Can I find you and talk?

880
01:21:14,690 --> 01:21:16,885
You're breaking my heart, Jack.

881
01:21:25,134 --> 01:21:26,863
- "Where's my lung?"
- Where's my lung?

882
01:21:26,936 --> 01:21:28,836
That's exactly what he said,
this is two years later.

883
01:21:28,905 --> 01:21:30,463
No, it's true.
Apparently he'd seen some shrink

884
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:32,599
who told him he was suffering
from "organ bereavement".

885
01:21:32,675 --> 01:21:36,111
He should ask for his lung back.
I told him he should dial 1-900-LUNG.

886
01:21:36,178 --> 01:21:39,614
Yeah. "Hello, remember me?
I want my lung back."

887
01:21:39,682 --> 01:21:43,448
I don't believe it. It's Mr. Dribble.
The guy's a fruitcake.

888
01:21:43,519 --> 01:21:47,751
- That's your patient.
- That's Richards? What's he doing?

889
01:21:47,823 --> 01:21:51,190
I saved the guy's life,
and then he just fucks me over.

890
01:21:54,664 --> 01:22:00,364
- He's suing me. Is that crap?
- See you later.

891
01:22:00,436 --> 01:22:06,705
Jack, where are you going? Jack!
The guy's taking us to court!

892
01:22:10,813 --> 01:22:13,077
I'm telling you, man. It's unbelievable.

893
01:22:13,149 --> 01:22:19,019
- Hey, Mister, you need a hand?
- Keys. Locked... car.

894
01:22:20,323 --> 01:22:22,723
I'm sorry, you lost your keys?

895
01:22:22,792 --> 01:22:29,561
Locked... Keys. Locked. In car.

896
01:22:29,632 --> 01:22:35,662
You locked your keys in the car. Oh, my.

897
01:22:35,738 --> 01:22:39,299
I'm late. Speech therapy.

898
01:22:39,375 --> 01:22:42,936
Look, you go on ahead.
I work here at the hospital.

899
01:22:43,012 --> 01:22:47,813
I'll have your keys left for you at the front
desk. I come equipped. I'll make a call.

900
01:22:47,883 --> 01:22:50,113
It's not a problem.

901
01:22:51,854 --> 01:22:57,087
Name is... Richards.

902
01:22:58,661 --> 01:23:03,064
Mr. Richards? Don't worry.
It's not a problem.

903
01:23:03,766 --> 01:23:07,964
This... just driving me crazy.

904
01:23:19,482 --> 01:23:22,713
- It's gonna be OK.
- Thank you.

905
01:23:25,654 --> 01:23:28,452
Aahhh...

906
01:23:28,523 --> 01:23:30,514
OK.

907
01:23:32,394 --> 01:23:36,888
I'd make a gag,
but I'm busy gagging.

908
01:23:39,801 --> 01:23:42,269
How's it look?

909
01:23:44,372 --> 01:23:47,705
Well, I think Dr. Reed
had already mentioned that the, um,

910
01:23:47,776 --> 01:23:50,404
the tumor had gotten bigger.

911
01:23:52,981 --> 01:23:56,974
No. No, no!

912
01:23:57,052 --> 01:24:00,954
He said it was worried it hadn't
gotten smaller. He didn't... Is it bigger?

913
01:24:01,022 --> 01:24:06,892
It's disappointing because we, uh... we
get a very good cure rate with radiation.

914
01:24:08,329 --> 01:24:11,594
Yeah, that's disappointing as hell.

915
01:24:14,369 --> 01:24:17,361
Look, look. OK, I'm asking.
This is torture.

916
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:21,432
What is the prognosis on my
vocal cords? Can you save them?

917
01:24:22,043 --> 01:24:26,776
I won't know until I'm there.
But that would be the idea, yes.

918
01:24:29,284 --> 01:24:31,878
Maria? Yeah, I'm looking at moving

919
01:24:31,953 --> 01:24:35,650
the tongue or the parotid a day or two
to make way for the laryngeal.

920
01:24:35,724 --> 01:24:40,058
Or the other option is doing
the adenoids late on the 20th.

921
01:24:40,128 --> 01:24:44,895
Yeah, that works. Adenoids late on the
20th and laryngeal afternoon of the 18th.

922
01:24:44,966 --> 01:24:49,733
No. No, I don't want you
cutting me in the afternoon.

923
01:24:49,804 --> 01:24:50,793
Excuse me?

924
01:24:50,872 --> 01:24:53,136
You'll be tired in the afternoon,
and ragged and hungry.

925
01:24:53,208 --> 01:24:56,700
You'll have been on your feet for hours.

926
01:24:56,778 --> 01:25:00,544
Come on, we both know how it is.

927
01:25:00,615 --> 01:25:03,209
I am the doctor and you are my patient.

928
01:25:03,284 --> 01:25:06,913
And I am telling you
when I am available.

929
01:25:07,956 --> 01:25:11,448
Now let's get this thing out
before it does any more damage.

930
01:25:35,884 --> 01:25:37,875
Knife.

931
01:25:44,425 --> 01:25:46,484
Let's go, boy.

932
01:25:53,001 --> 01:25:57,165
- Are you OK, Doctor?
- Jack?

933
01:26:10,618 --> 01:26:12,745
Let's go, Jacko.

934
01:26:23,031 --> 01:26:25,659
OK, here we go.

935
01:26:47,722 --> 01:26:49,713
It's Jack.

936
01:26:55,830 --> 01:26:58,025
I lost it.

937
01:26:58,733 --> 01:27:02,692
June, I lost it today.

938
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:08,434
I should go home. It's too late, I'll go.

939
01:27:09,043 --> 01:27:12,308
No, it's OK. It's OK. Come in.

940
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:16,840
And then, there's Anne. But...

941
01:27:18,686 --> 01:27:22,144
No, you know.

942
01:27:22,223 --> 01:27:28,093
Um, I'll go. This is terrible.
I woke you up.

943
01:27:29,130 --> 01:27:32,361
"There's Anne, but..."?

944
01:27:32,433 --> 01:27:35,732
I don't know. I don't know.

945
01:27:36,971 --> 01:27:39,235
I don't know.

946
01:27:42,677 --> 01:27:48,411
I've kept her there, you know,
over there, for so long.

947
01:27:48,483 --> 01:27:54,422
And now... I can't get my arm down.

948
01:28:01,529 --> 01:28:03,793
I have to have the operation, June.

949
01:28:11,705 --> 01:28:13,764
I'm sorry.

950
01:29:15,736 --> 01:29:18,034
Excuse me, you can't go...

951
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:22,806
Dr. MacKee's headed back there.
You'd better come out.

952
01:29:25,712 --> 01:29:29,170
Dr. MacKee. What is it?

953
01:29:30,250 --> 01:29:31,945
Do you have a minute?

954
01:29:32,019 --> 01:29:35,921
You can see for yourself.
I have a waiting room full of patients.

955
01:29:35,989 --> 01:29:39,254
- One fewer.
- What?

956
01:29:39,326 --> 01:29:42,489
You have one fewer patients. I'm out.

957
01:29:42,562 --> 01:29:44,996
Look, Doctor, I know
how you must be feeling.

958
01:29:45,065 --> 01:29:50,799
That's the problem. You don't have
the first idea what I'm feeling.

959
01:29:52,072 --> 01:29:55,508
I think we better continue this
conversation some other time.

960
01:29:55,575 --> 01:29:59,102
I think you ought to brush up
your act, Dr. Abbott.

961
01:29:59,179 --> 01:30:00,737
Because today I'm sick.

962
01:30:00,814 --> 01:30:05,376
Tomorrow or the day after
or 30 years from now, you'll be sick.

963
01:30:05,452 --> 01:30:10,685
Every doctor becomes a patient
somewhere down the line, and then...

964
01:30:11,425 --> 01:30:15,293
it'll hit you as hard as it's hit me.

965
01:30:16,263 --> 01:30:18,731
I'm finding you very offensive,
so if you don't mind...

966
01:30:18,799 --> 01:30:20,790
Sure.

967
01:30:22,969 --> 01:30:27,235
If I had a patient like me
when I was a doctor like you, I'd...

968
01:30:27,307 --> 01:30:32,301
I'll just... wait for my file.

969
01:30:33,213 --> 01:30:35,374
I'll get you your file.

970
01:30:50,263 --> 01:30:54,461
Airmail. Thank you.

971
01:31:04,511 --> 01:31:06,741
- Eli...
- Jack.

972
01:31:08,281 --> 01:31:11,375
- May I speak with you for a minute?
- Sure.

973
01:31:22,062 --> 01:31:24,997
I need a partial laryngectomy.

974
01:31:27,567 --> 01:31:31,128
Would you do it?
I don't know a doctor I trust more.

975
01:31:33,907 --> 01:31:36,171
I'll do it tomorrow.

976
01:31:39,279 --> 01:31:41,679
Tomorrow...

977
01:31:41,748 --> 01:31:46,981
Yeah, I'm not working,
so... we'll get you in.

978
01:31:47,053 --> 01:31:49,044
Thank you.

979
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:54,658
You know, I've been pretty...

980
01:31:55,495 --> 01:32:02,401
No, very insulting about you in the past...

981
01:32:02,469 --> 01:32:04,960
which I'm ashamed of.

982
01:32:05,038 --> 01:32:07,871
<i>Dr. Blumfield. Ready in two.</i>

983
01:32:07,941 --> 01:32:13,174
Yeah, well, that's OK, Jack. I, um...

984
01:32:13,246 --> 01:32:17,945
I've always wanted to slit your throat.

985
01:32:18,018 --> 01:32:23,479
Now I'm gonna get a chance to do that.

986
01:32:32,966 --> 01:32:35,594
I'll see you tomorrow.

987
01:32:41,875 --> 01:32:44,867
Murray, can I speak to you, please?

988
01:32:44,945 --> 01:32:47,607
- What's wrong?
- Let's go in here.

989
01:32:54,587 --> 01:32:59,581
- What's going on?
- I have to have surgery on my throat.

990
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:06,257
- A partial laryngectomy.
- Jesus, Jack. Why didn't you say?

991
01:33:06,332 --> 01:33:09,859
I knew you were jumpy,
and then yesterday...

992
01:33:09,935 --> 01:33:13,393
I was saying to Pete,
I thought it was me or something.

993
01:33:13,472 --> 01:33:16,441
- I asked Eli Blumfield.
- The Rabbi?

994
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:20,945
It's tomorrow. I trust him.
I don't wanna lose my voice.

995
01:33:22,648 --> 01:33:25,481
Well, me neither. I need you talking.

996
01:33:25,551 --> 01:33:27,883
Tomorrow...

997
01:33:27,953 --> 01:33:30,251
But even if I can talk...

998
01:33:33,058 --> 01:33:35,424
I won't be testifying.

999
01:33:37,029 --> 01:33:38,860
Say that again?

1000
01:33:38,931 --> 01:33:40,990
I won't testify because I tell the truth

1001
01:33:41,066 --> 01:33:44,035
and the truth is that poor guy
had a history of thrombophlebitis.

1002
01:33:44,103 --> 01:33:48,540
- Well, how did you know that?
- I called his internist.

1003
01:33:48,607 --> 01:33:52,407
What'd you think?
You could just tear up his records?

1004
01:33:53,746 --> 01:33:58,479
It's not relevant, Jack.
You could argue as an expert.

1005
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:00,211
No.

1006
01:34:03,689 --> 01:34:08,991
What did you do this for, huh?
Checking up on me?

1007
01:34:09,061 --> 01:34:12,758
You wanted a witness.
I wanted to know what I was witnessing.

1008
01:34:15,367 --> 01:34:17,961
14 years is what you're witnessing.

1009
01:34:18,037 --> 01:34:21,268
Me covering your tail,
you covering mine.

1010
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:27,370
Why did you pull his file?
You can't do that.

1011
01:34:32,117 --> 01:34:37,521
It's not relevant. It's a judgment thing.

1012
01:34:39,291 --> 01:34:42,021
I'm sorry, Murray.

1013
01:34:43,696 --> 01:34:46,062
No, no.

1014
01:34:47,433 --> 01:34:51,426
It's not just me, partner.

1015
01:34:51,503 --> 01:34:54,836
Your neck is on the fucking line, too.

1016
01:34:56,308 --> 01:34:59,971
Yeah, that's right.

1017
01:35:02,314 --> 01:35:05,374
Jack, you're killing me.

1018
01:35:05,451 --> 01:35:08,215
I have a surgery.
I'll find someone else to help me out.

1019
01:35:08,287 --> 01:35:13,224
Jack, hell you will. Hey, Jacko.

1020
01:35:13,292 --> 01:35:15,385
Jack!

1021
01:35:24,703 --> 01:35:27,729
Carrie told me about your surgery.

1022
01:35:30,209 --> 01:35:32,234
I was going to...

1023
01:35:35,214 --> 01:35:37,648
Oh, Anne...

1024
01:35:38,717 --> 01:35:42,983
Yeah, well, that's how I find out
most things about us, you know.

1025
01:35:44,423 --> 01:35:49,952
Dinner dates, messages,
your problems...

1026
01:35:50,028 --> 01:35:52,462
through your secretary.

1027
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:59,266
It's the 28th, is that right?

1028
01:36:01,774 --> 01:36:04,106
It's tomorrow.

1029
01:36:07,546 --> 01:36:09,605
Tomorrow?

1030
01:36:12,684 --> 01:36:14,811
Eli Blumfield's gonna do me.

1031
01:36:17,322 --> 01:36:20,223
You heard that from me first.

1032
01:36:24,496 --> 01:36:30,662
Last night... Did you go
to your friend? June?

1033
01:36:32,070 --> 01:36:34,766
Yes, I did.

1034
01:36:38,677 --> 01:36:44,741
You know what I resent?
I don't resent her.

1035
01:36:44,817 --> 01:36:50,949
Truly, I... I'm sure she's...
She must be very special.

1036
01:36:54,226 --> 01:36:56,660
It's just that...

1037
01:37:00,332 --> 01:37:04,166
You have a friend to go to. You know?

1038
01:37:04,236 --> 01:37:08,263
And you were always my friend,

1039
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:11,639
and... now I can't go to you.

1040
01:37:13,579 --> 01:37:17,481
Anyway, blah-blah-blah. I have to go.

1041
01:37:26,758 --> 01:37:29,022
You know, it's funny.

1042
01:37:29,995 --> 01:37:33,863
I wake up every morning,
and I have this... this feeling.

1043
01:37:33,932 --> 01:37:36,833
This sensation.

1044
01:37:37,702 --> 01:37:40,136
And I didn't know what it was.

1045
01:37:40,671 --> 01:37:46,541
What is it? Am I hungry? Am I tired?

1046
01:37:46,611 --> 01:37:48,909
Am I sad?

1047
01:37:50,715 --> 01:37:54,947
Then I realized... I'm just lonely.

1048
01:38:36,193 --> 01:38:38,184
June?

1049
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:42,799
- June, it's Jack.
- I don't think she can hear you.

1050
01:39:14,465 --> 01:39:17,798
It's me. It's Jack.

1051
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:25,073
And I came over last night
and I made you so tired.

1052
01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:32,672
I have my operation tomorrow.

1053
01:39:33,551 --> 01:39:38,454
And selfish to the end, I was hoping
you'd be there to help me through it.

1054
01:39:41,425 --> 01:39:43,757
Oh, June...

1055
01:39:43,828 --> 01:39:49,391
I'm... I'm really terrified.

1056
01:39:50,034 --> 01:39:55,233
That's the truth... which I got from you.

1057
01:39:55,306 --> 01:39:57,297
The truth.

1058
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:07,850
Do you know, I don't even
know anything about you.

1059
01:40:08,552 --> 01:40:10,543
Not really.

1060
01:40:13,457 --> 01:40:19,191
I know you love life.
And I know you can dance.

1061
01:40:21,666 --> 01:40:25,625
I hope you always fly over my house...

1062
01:40:26,904 --> 01:40:29,805
<i>with your lovely long hair.</i>

1063
01:41:03,407 --> 01:41:06,308
My friend June died today.

1064
01:41:46,650 --> 01:41:49,619
How you doing, Jack?

1065
01:41:49,687 --> 01:41:52,155
I'd rather be in Philadelphia.

1066
01:42:01,499 --> 01:42:07,404
- Hi, Doctor.
- Nancy. Hi.

1067
01:42:07,471 --> 01:42:10,838
My, my, my.

1068
01:42:10,908 --> 01:42:14,605
- We're rooting for you, Jack.
- Thank you, Joe.

1069
01:42:14,678 --> 01:42:17,909
Yeah, do. Root like crazy.

1070
01:42:21,752 --> 01:42:24,050
Did you find it? Great.

1071
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:29,490
OK, Jack, your neck feels clear to me.

1072
01:42:30,527 --> 01:42:32,518
Good.

1073
01:42:34,097 --> 01:42:37,362
I'm gonna keep telling you everything
that I'm doing as I'm doing it.

1074
01:42:37,433 --> 01:42:41,130
So I want you to just relax
as much as possible.

1075
01:42:41,204 --> 01:42:46,608
And before I scrub in,
we have a little treat for you.

1076
01:43:16,706 --> 01:43:20,904
Oh...

1077
01:44:01,017 --> 01:44:05,044
We got the tumor, and there was
no cross-over, which is good.

1078
01:44:05,121 --> 01:44:07,555
It's great.

1079
01:44:07,624 --> 01:44:10,115
I was not able to save
all of the vocal cords,

1080
01:44:10,193 --> 01:44:16,996
so I... I can't make any guarantees
about the voice, Anne.

1081
01:44:18,434 --> 01:44:23,030
It was very clean,
and we're just gonna have

1082
01:44:23,106 --> 01:44:26,507
to wait and see.

1083
01:44:27,243 --> 01:44:32,374
- Are you OK here?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

1084
01:44:43,893 --> 01:44:45,884
Nicky?

1085
01:45:18,061 --> 01:45:20,689
I meant to give this
to you at the hospital.

1086
01:45:27,603 --> 01:45:29,594
Sorry.

1087
01:46:25,061 --> 01:46:27,325
That's not the color I asked for!

1088
01:46:27,397 --> 01:46:30,161
No, I wanted the wall
to match the cupboard!

1089
01:46:30,233 --> 01:46:32,497
How many times
do I have to tell you that?

1090
01:46:32,568 --> 01:46:36,902
We sat down yesterday and I circled
the one I wanted. Remember that?

1091
01:46:36,973 --> 01:46:41,740
Yeah... Oh, great, so now I'm color-blind
on top of everything else?

1092
01:46:42,378 --> 01:46:45,506
I know what I was doing.
This is what you asked for.

1093
01:46:45,581 --> 01:46:47,845
- Terrific.
- Well, I warned you that color...

1094
01:46:47,917 --> 01:46:50,818
Look, just forget it!
I'll paint it myself, OK?

1095
01:46:56,726 --> 01:46:59,661
Jack, let go of me. What are you doing?

1096
01:46:59,729 --> 01:47:03,130
I don't wanna go outside. Jack!

1097
01:47:05,968 --> 01:47:07,959
No!

1098
01:47:08,504 --> 01:47:12,463
No, I don't wanna yell at you.
I want to go inside! Do you mind?

1099
01:47:13,375 --> 01:47:15,434
Yeah, right. And now it's done.
Are you happy?

1100
01:47:15,510 --> 01:47:19,241
Now would you please
let me go inside? God, Jack.

1101
01:47:19,815 --> 01:47:22,409
You're crazy.

1102
01:47:22,484 --> 01:47:26,215
Jack, stop it. Jack, stop it!

1103
01:47:26,288 --> 01:47:28,916
Stop it, OK! OK.

1104
01:47:28,990 --> 01:47:30,855
But get in the house.
If you want me to yell at you,

1105
01:47:30,926 --> 01:47:34,555
I'll yell at you in the house, OK?
Now get inside!

1106
01:47:37,766 --> 01:47:39,757
Jack!

1107
01:47:41,403 --> 01:47:44,133
Look, Jack, I don't know
what you want from me.

1108
01:48:02,924 --> 01:48:07,293
No, you don't. You don't need me.
No, I don't believe you.

1109
01:48:07,362 --> 01:48:10,991
I was there. I was there for you, Jack,
and you didn't need me.

1110
01:48:31,086 --> 01:48:36,183
Yeah, me, too. Me, too.

1111
01:48:43,765 --> 01:48:47,633
Stop it! Stop blowing that thing! Stop it!

1112
01:48:50,005 --> 01:48:51,996
Stop it!

1113
01:48:57,679 --> 01:49:01,706
"Start again"? Jesus...

1114
01:49:01,783 --> 01:49:04,013
Jack, stop it!

1115
01:49:04,085 --> 01:49:08,215
Stop it! Stop it! God...

1116
01:49:08,290 --> 01:49:10,281
Goddamn it!

1117
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:49,256
I just wish I'd never given you
this stupid whistle!

1118
01:49:53,034 --> 01:49:56,470
I love you.

1119
01:49:56,538 --> 01:49:58,529
I love you.

1120
01:50:00,642 --> 01:50:03,406
You're talking.

1121
01:50:06,248 --> 01:50:08,239
Shh.

1122
01:50:42,817 --> 01:50:44,808
Aah!

1123
01:50:51,459 --> 01:50:54,428
Hello, Jack. Welcome back.

1124
01:51:02,904 --> 01:51:04,895
So...

1125
01:51:06,708 --> 01:51:08,835
They're harvesting the heart
any minute now.

1126
01:51:08,910 --> 01:51:14,507
It'll be flown in from New York,
whence all good things come.

1127
01:51:31,166 --> 01:51:33,760
- What's the problem?
- Nothing, Doctor.

1128
01:51:33,835 --> 01:51:35,826
What?

1129
01:51:37,072 --> 01:51:40,371
My wife wants to know what's
impossible to know about the donor.

1130
01:51:40,442 --> 01:51:44,640
She thinks because we say
things like "kindhearted"...

1131
01:51:44,713 --> 01:51:49,650
"good-hearted"... that these
qualities come from the heart.

1132
01:51:52,554 --> 01:51:55,216
Tell her I think they do.

1133
01:52:27,354 --> 01:52:29,413
Yes?

1134
01:52:29,490 --> 01:52:33,483
The helicopter's landed.
15 minutes, Doctor.

1135
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:36,222
Thank you, Nancy.

1136
01:52:36,296 --> 01:52:40,790
Arturo... here we go.

1137
01:52:44,438 --> 01:52:46,235
- Here you go. Good luck.
- Thanks.

1138
01:52:50,611 --> 01:52:54,911
OK. We're all hooked up.

1139
01:52:54,982 --> 01:52:58,145
Watch your flow
and watch your pressure.

1140
01:53:00,654 --> 01:53:05,284
Ross clamp is... off.

1141
01:53:16,236 --> 01:53:19,672
Start beating, sweetheart.

1142
01:53:27,247 --> 01:53:31,149
Go, heart!

1143
01:53:40,594 --> 01:53:43,961
Your wife will be delighted, Arturo.

1144
01:53:53,006 --> 01:53:55,440
It's a beautiful heart.

1145
01:54:12,926 --> 01:54:15,656
Any messages for me?

1146
01:54:15,729 --> 01:54:18,197
These... and something personal.

1147
01:54:18,265 --> 01:54:21,462
Oh, thanks.

1148
01:54:24,505 --> 01:54:27,804
It's been an hour already.
I'm out of here, people.

1149
01:54:27,875 --> 01:54:29,206
- Hasn't been an hour.
- Yeah, it has.

1150
01:54:29,276 --> 01:54:32,211
Hi! Sorry, I kept you waiting.

1151
01:54:32,279 --> 01:54:34,770
Good, good, good.

1152
01:54:34,848 --> 01:54:37,214
OK, well.

1153
01:54:39,319 --> 01:54:43,380
Can you strip naked and put on your
hospital gowns, quick as you can?

1154
01:54:47,361 --> 01:54:51,559
- Dr. MacKee, this is a joke.
- I'm not laughing. Ah, here they are.

1155
01:54:51,632 --> 01:54:57,628
Alan, Roger, Lonnie...

1156
01:54:57,704 --> 01:55:03,870
- Let's go. Sarah, Jay-Jay, Michael.
- Anything in a paisley?

1157
01:55:14,087 --> 01:55:16,078
Doctors...

1158
01:55:18,525 --> 01:55:23,588
You have spent a lot of time
learning the Latin names

1159
01:55:23,664 --> 01:55:28,124
for diseases your patients might have.

1160
01:55:28,201 --> 01:55:31,637
Now it's time to learn...

1161
01:55:31,705 --> 01:55:34,299
something simpler about them.

1162
01:55:34,374 --> 01:55:37,969
Patients have their own names.

1163
01:55:38,045 --> 01:55:40,036
Sarah.

1164
01:55:40,747 --> 01:55:44,581
Alan. Jack.

1165
01:55:45,686 --> 01:55:49,383
They feel frightened...

1166
01:55:50,824 --> 01:55:53,258
embarrassed and vulnerable.

1167
01:55:53,327 --> 01:55:58,993
And they feel sick.
Most of all, they want to get better.

1168
01:55:59,499 --> 01:56:02,127
Because of that...

1169
01:56:05,639 --> 01:56:09,097
they put their lives in our hands.

1170
01:56:10,844 --> 01:56:14,644
I could try to explain what that means
until I'm blue in the face.

1171
01:56:14,715 --> 01:56:17,946
But, you know something,
it wouldn't mean a thing.

1172
01:56:19,453 --> 01:56:22,547
It sure as hell never did to me.

1173
01:56:25,926 --> 01:56:28,724
So, for the next 72 hours,

1174
01:56:28,795 --> 01:56:32,856
you'll each be allocated
a particular disease.

1175
01:56:35,335 --> 01:56:39,965
You'll sleep in hospital beds,
eat hospital food.

1176
01:56:40,039 --> 01:56:42,803
Hospital food?

1177
01:56:42,875 --> 01:56:49,576
You'll be given all the appropriate tests.
Tests you will one day prescribe.

1178
01:56:49,649 --> 01:56:51,844
Unbelievable.

1179
01:56:54,053 --> 01:57:00,458
You are no longer... doctors.
You are hospital patients.

1180
01:57:08,968 --> 01:57:14,167
So, good luck. I'll see you on my rounds.

1181
01:57:36,495 --> 01:57:39,123
<i>Dear Jack...</i>

1182
01:57:39,198 --> 01:57:44,500
<i>You've just left. And I've been
sitting here worrying about you.</i>

1183
01:57:44,570 --> 01:57:50,031
<i>You were talking about Anne
and not knowing how to let her close.</i>

1184
01:57:50,109 --> 01:57:52,509
<i>How to let anyone close.</i>

1185
01:57:52,578 --> 01:57:57,379
<i>And I thought of this little story for you.</i>

1186
01:57:57,450 --> 01:58:00,851
<i>I hope you get it before your operation.</i>

1187
01:58:03,723 --> 01:58:05,714
Going up?

1188
01:58:10,129 --> 01:58:13,292
<i>There was a farmer
who had a lot of fields.</i>

1189
01:58:13,365 --> 01:58:17,665
<i>And he kept all of the birds
and creatures away from his crops</i>

1190
01:58:17,737 --> 01:58:20,638
<i>with traps and fences.</i>

1191
01:58:20,706 --> 01:58:24,904
<i>He was very successful.
But he was very lonely.</i>

1192
01:58:26,212 --> 01:58:29,375
<i>So. One day. He stood in the middle</i>

1193
01:58:29,448 --> 01:58:33,544
<i>of his fields to welcome the animals.</i>

1194
01:58:33,619 --> 01:58:40,047
<i>He stayed there from dawn to dusk with
his arms outstretched calling to them.</i>

1195
01:58:40,659 --> 01:58:45,790
<i>But not a single animal came.
Not a single creature appeared.</i>

1196
01:58:48,267 --> 01:58:54,297
<i>They were terrified. You see.
Of the farmer's new scarecrow.</i>

1197
01:58:56,742 --> 01:59:02,044
<i>Dear Jack. Just let down your arms...</i>

1198
01:59:02,114 --> 01:59:05,345
<i>and we'll all come to you.</i>

1199
01:59:06,305 --> 01:59:12,483
