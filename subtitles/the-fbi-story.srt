00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:17,519
Flight number 21.

3
00:00:17,698 --> 00:00:23,432
Flight number 21, leaving at 6: 15,
now boarding at gate 12.

4
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:28,401
Webster's International Dictionary
defines murder...

5
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:33,877
...as the unlawful taking of human life
by another human being.

6
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:39,817
On a November evening in 1955,
the definition became obsolete.

7
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:44,290
A mass murder was being planned.

8
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:47,256
The instrument of murder
was hidden in a battered suitcase...

9
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:49,019
...at a Midwest airport.

10
00:00:49,196 --> 00:00:51,721
There'll be an excess
weight charge of $ 13.

11
00:00:51,898 --> 00:00:54,662
Goodness, I didn't know
it was that heavy.

12
00:00:55,202 --> 00:00:59,662
Only one person in the world knew why
the woman's luggage was so heavy.

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,774
Only one man knew
that a time bomb...

14
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:05,139
...was buried in the contents
of her suitcase.

15
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:11,443
He knew because he was the man
who had put it there.

16
00:01:12,152 --> 00:01:14,382
He also knew that the suitcase
would be placed...

17
00:01:14,554 --> 00:01:17,148
...in the cargo pit of an airplane.

18
00:01:17,457 --> 00:01:20,654
An airplane scheduled
to carry four crew members...

19
00:01:20,827 --> 00:01:23,421
...and 45 passengers.

20
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:28,563
- Here you are, Mrs. King.
- Thank you.

21
00:01:31,838 --> 00:01:33,738
- Sign right here, Mother.
- Life insurance?

22
00:01:33,907 --> 00:01:35,204
Yeah, I'm superstitious.

23
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:38,572
It's only when somebody hasn't got it
that things seem to go wrong.

24
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:42,606
Oh, my.
Thirty-seven thousand five hundred.

25
00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:44,512
- Maybe you'll be rich.
- I hope not.

26
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:47,050
Oh, now, don't you worry
about me, son.

27
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,246
These airships fly millions of miles
without an accident.

28
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:53,018
I'll be dropping you a postcard
from Portland tomorrow.

29
00:01:53,193 --> 00:01:54,524
Your attention, please.

30
00:01:54,694 --> 00:01:57,629
This is the final call
for flight number 21.

31
00:01:57,798 --> 00:02:00,198
- Flight 21 boarding at gate 12.
- That's us. Come on.

32
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:02,335
All aboard, please.

33
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:11,436
Now, you be careful while I'm away.
Don't get into any more trouble.

34
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:13,704
I won't. Now, you better get aboard.

35
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,313
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye.

36
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:22,185
- Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye, Mother.

37
00:03:50,477 --> 00:03:51,876
Look.

38
00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:01,218
The murder took place at 7:37,
on schedule.

39
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:06,553
And 49 men, women and children,
who never had anything in common...

40
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:09,456
...became final companions.

41
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,998
A number of organizations
were immediately involved...

42
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:17,799
...one of them an agency at 9th
and Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington.

43
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:21,871
Thousands of men and women
work for this organization.

44
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:25,739
Their daily chores
and their lives make up:

45
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:30,699
A few hours after
the Colorado airplane disaster...

46
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:34,938
...FBI agents joined with engineers
and CAB investigators...

47
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:38,209
...to collect and study the evidence.

48
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:40,845
The floor of a warehouse
was converted...

49
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:45,287
...into a scaled-down grid map
of the crash scene.

50
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,660
Each piece of wreckage
was placed on the grid...

51
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:52,286
...in the exact position
in which it was found.

52
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:57,403
The next step was to reassemble
the pieces into a rough facsimile...

53
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,868
...of the destroyed plane.

54
00:06:00,206 --> 00:06:04,302
This revealed a jagged hole
near cargo pit number four.

55
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:08,276
The Civil Aeronautics Board
asked the FBI...

56
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:11,349
...to begin a sabotage investigation.

57
00:06:11,518 --> 00:06:15,852
In less than three hours, over 100 agents
in 20 different cities went to work...

58
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:19,458
...digging into the backgrounds
of passengers and crew members.

59
00:06:19,626 --> 00:06:21,924
They were looking
for any stray item...

60
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:24,188
...which might indicate sabotage...

61
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:27,260
...or murder.

62
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:29,026
They talked to everyone concerned:

63
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:32,660
Relatives, friends and enemies.

64
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:36,173
I understand that you were
acquainted with Mrs. King.

65
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:37,570
Yes, sir.

66
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:40,144
She used to live right next door there
with her kid.

67
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:43,146
He forged a check once or twice...

68
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:45,045
...and he was pinched
for bootlegging.

69
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:47,118
Remember anything else
that might help us?

70
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:51,348
No, except his mother
didn't seem to mind very much.

71
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:55,119
She acted like he was just having
a streak of bad manners or something.

72
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:57,192
That's about all I can recall.

73
00:06:57,363 --> 00:06:59,661
I guess it doesn't amount to much.

74
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,767
But it did amount to something.

75
00:07:02,936 --> 00:07:08,636
It brought into focus the name
and the face of Jack Graham.

76
00:07:08,808 --> 00:07:12,471
It wasn't much, but sometimes
it doesn't take much.

77
00:07:12,645 --> 00:07:14,909
One time, a crowbar
won't bend a cobweb.

78
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:19,609
Another time, a falling leaf
will start an avalanche.

79
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:21,651
It was a lead.

80
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:24,381
The whole FBI was alerted.

81
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:29,289
Agents in the field collected every available
piece of information on Jack Graham.

82
00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:31,054
From people who knew him.

83
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:34,997
From people who didn't know
that they knew him.

84
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:38,761
- Operator.
- It was all relayed to Washington.

85
00:07:38,938 --> 00:07:41,270
It was combined with information
from bureau files.

86
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:42,635
FBI Headquarters.

87
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:47,137
A pattern began to emerge,
and it boiled down to this:

88
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:51,974
Jack Graham was very sentimental
about insurance.

89
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:53,551
He'd collected on it twice.

90
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,417
The first time, it was an explosion
in a restaurant his mother owned.

91
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,583
Another time, he stalled a pickup truck
on the railroad tracks.

92
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:04,559
He seemed very surprised
when the train happened by.

93
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:06,699
And finally...

94
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,969
...he'd insured his mother's life.

95
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:15,105
By now, FBI chemists
had found something else.

96
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:20,872
A piece of metal taken from the crash
showed traces of sodium carbonate...

97
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:25,313
...sodium nitrate
and sulfur-bearing compounds.

98
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:29,421
These are chemicals found
after an explosion of dynamite.

99
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:34,051
There was now enough evidence
to move forward.

100
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,660
Carefully detailed instructions
went out to the Denver Field Office.

101
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:41,128
What is your name?

102
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:43,834
I'm John Gilbert Graham.

103
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:48,330
- Your address?
- 2750 Pitcher Road.

104
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:51,238
We want to advise you of your rights.

105
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:54,480
The door over there is open.
You can walk out any time you wish.

106
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:58,014
Or there's a telephone.
You can call an attorney.

107
00:08:58,184 --> 00:09:00,049
Because anything you say here...

108
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,586
...can be used against you
in a court of law.

109
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:06,521
- Is that clear?
- That's clear. I've got nothing to hide.

110
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:07,921
She did her own packing.

111
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:11,427
I haven't got the slightest idea
about anything that was in the baggage.

112
00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:16,595
But the next day,
agents talked to a family friend.

113
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:18,930
A discrepancy showed up.

114
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:22,199
Yes, Jack had a package for her
to take along on the trip.

115
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:25,208
It was wrapped like a gift.
I guess he wanted to surprise her.

116
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:28,006
I guess he did.
Do you know what it was?

117
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:32,379
Well, yes, it was a set of drills
and files and cutting tools.

118
00:09:32,552 --> 00:09:35,817
His mother had a hobby of making
costume jewelry from seashells.

119
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:38,219
That's what the set of tools was for.

120
00:09:38,391 --> 00:09:40,655
Do you remember anything else?

121
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:44,593
No, not that I recall.

122
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:48,962
She said you purchased
a toolkit for your mother.

123
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:51,703
Don't you remember?

124
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,201
Oh, come to think of it,
I did buy a toolkit last month.

125
00:09:57,377 --> 00:10:00,540
And I put it in her suitcase.
It wasn't important. I'd forgotten it.

126
00:10:00,713 --> 00:10:04,308
We've checked all the stores
in Denver that sell that kind of thing.

127
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:07,518
Yeah, well...
Well, I didn't buy it in Denver.

128
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:11,350
But you haven't been out of Denver
for two years. We've checked that too.

129
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:14,492
Look, we wanna remind you again
that you have certain rights.

130
00:10:14,661 --> 00:10:16,754
You bet I have, and I wanna
get this straight.

131
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,956
Are you insinuating
I blew up that plane?

132
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:23,235
No. We don't insinuate.

133
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:24,961
We simply collect evidence.

134
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:27,470
Well, okay, I got nothing
to be afraid of, then.

135
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,699
I didn't do anything.

136
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:33,708
- Do you mind if we search your home?
- No, I don't care.

137
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,007
You won't find anything.

138
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:39,742
Sign this waiver, please.

139
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:47,587
In Graham's house,
the agents found a small coil of wire.

140
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,389
The kind which can be used
to detonate dynamite.

141
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:54,464
And finally, they found the last link.

142
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:59,071
A storekeeper verified
that he'd sold material to Jack Graham.

143
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:01,263
The sales order read:

144
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:05,468
"One timing device,
25 sticks of dynamite."

145
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:07,913
A medical doctor
attested to the fact...

146
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:11,448
...that Graham
was in sound mental condition.

147
00:11:11,617 --> 00:11:15,849
Graham formally acknowledged
that he was not speaking under duress.

148
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:19,251
He acknowledged a lot more too.

149
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,759
So then I slipped the bomb
into her suitcase.

150
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:27,297
Twenty-five sticks of dynamite...

151
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,765
...two electric primer caps,
a timer and a six-volt battery.

152
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:33,094
Stand up.

153
00:11:33,373 --> 00:11:35,500
Put the cuffs on him.

154
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:45,945
In case I get any mail...

155
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:49,111
...you can send it to Cañon City Prison
for the next month or so.

156
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:51,813
After that, you can send it to hell.

157
00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:58,658
Jack Graham's only mistake
was that he was absent-minded.

158
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:03,296
He forgot about the broad research powers
of the FBI.

159
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:07,701
Its high-speed communications,
its endless flow of vital correspondence.

160
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:12,042
A laboratory equipped
to analyze any and all documents.

161
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:13,439
The serology section...

162
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:16,878
...geared to break down
every known blood sample.

163
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,281
A firearms section,
containing 2000 weapons.

164
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:25,652
Rifles, shotguns, pistols,
revolvers and machine guns...

165
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:28,988
...most of them collected
from its clientele.

166
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:35,330
It took years to build up the FBI,
to train it and retrain it...

167
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:40,268
...to staff it with lawyers, accountants,
scientists, all working together.

168
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,036
So when Jack Graham
took on the modern FBI...

169
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:48,942
...he took on too much and too many.

170
00:12:49,115 --> 00:12:50,980
He bargained badly.

171
00:12:51,484 --> 00:12:54,976
Now, in the old days, Jack Graham
might've gotten off a lot cheaper.

172
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:59,523
He could have killed 49 people
for a little under $ 11, tax included...

173
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:02,092
...because the bureau
was a haphazard outfit.

174
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:06,129
Nobody knew exactly how
it got started or where it was going.

175
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:08,733
As a matter of fact,
it wasn't really a bureau...

176
00:13:08,901 --> 00:13:10,994
...it was sort of an afterthought.

177
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,105
Now, here is the original building
in Washington.

178
00:13:14,273 --> 00:13:18,073
We occupied one small floor
of that building.

179
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:21,645
It was out-of-date, disorganized.

180
00:13:21,814 --> 00:13:25,341
Didn't even have enough space
to keep decent records.

181
00:13:25,518 --> 00:13:28,282
Actually, that was sort of
the main incentive...

182
00:13:28,454 --> 00:13:30,786
...for catching a criminal in those days:

183
00:13:30,957 --> 00:13:33,858
Arrest him before his file gets too thick.

184
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:37,518
And on top of that,
there was a lot of politics.

185
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,689
It was that way too
in some of the field offices.

186
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:44,359
Knoxville, for instance.

187
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:47,266
I know because I was there.

188
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:50,906
It was early May in 1924.

189
00:13:51,077 --> 00:13:56,379
There were some good men, all right,
but there was politics and laziness too.

190
00:13:56,549 --> 00:14:00,246
And nothing ever seemed to be
planned or worked out.

191
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:03,911
I've seen pillow fights
that were better organized.

192
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,490
No, no, no. Push it harder. Push it.
It might catch on or something.

193
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:13,757
Chip, you'll have to squeeze
on through there.

194
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:15,423
We're trying to fix this fan.

195
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:18,729
Six times I wrote them
in Washington about that fan.

196
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:21,806
Six times I told them
we're gonna swelter down here.

197
00:14:21,974 --> 00:14:23,202
- What's that?
- Affidavits.

198
00:14:23,376 --> 00:14:25,606
And they don't even bother
to answer. Not a line.

199
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:27,678
Marge, how many times
did I write them?

200
00:14:28,114 --> 00:14:29,376
Six times, sir.

201
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:31,043
That's right, six times.

202
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:33,651
And not one line back,
not one measly line.

203
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:35,912
And in the meantime,
we sit here and swelter.

204
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:39,455
- Harry, about these affidavits...
- Let me ask you just one fair question.

205
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,287
- Does it seem warm in here to you?
- Well, yes, I guess so.

206
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:46,295
It's sweltering, that's what it is.
And they give us one measly fan.

207
00:14:46,465 --> 00:14:48,456
- And that don't work.
- This is important.

208
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:50,795
These affidavits.
They're from Fairfield County.

209
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,631
I got four of them,
from four people.

210
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:54,932
There are a lot of other people
just like them.

211
00:14:55,107 --> 00:14:57,735
- Just like what?
- It's a system that's been going on.

212
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,402
- The people are in bondage out there.
- Somebody's got them locked up?

213
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:04,379
That's practically it.
Yeah, they're tied to the land.

214
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,847
They're even afraid to vote.

215
00:15:06,018 --> 00:15:08,509
It's happening all over Fairfield County.

216
00:15:08,688 --> 00:15:10,553
And it works just as easy as pie.

217
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:13,317
Now, suppose a fella gets
put into jail for some reason.

218
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:15,756
All right, the land owners
go to the magistrate...

219
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:17,691
...and they pay off the fella's fine.

220
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:19,854
Then bring him back
and let him work it off.

221
00:15:20,032 --> 00:15:21,932
Only, he never gets it worked off.

222
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:25,332
And the debt just keeps building up
and building up and piling up...

223
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:27,233
I don't know what we can do about it.

224
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:29,772
I told you, faster.
You're slower than the fan.

225
00:15:29,942 --> 00:15:32,274
Whirl it. Whirl it.

226
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:36,404
I'll tell you what we can do about it.
We can send a report in to Washington.

227
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:39,312
We're not gonna waste
one more 2-cent stamp...

228
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:41,885
...till we get this thing fixed there
about that fan.

229
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:43,316
These people can't vote.

230
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:46,981
They don't need to until November.
In the meantime, we sit here and swelter.

231
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:48,751
People's rights are being violated.

232
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:51,192
What if they are?
We don't know anything about it.

233
00:15:51,364 --> 00:15:53,457
We've never had a case
on anything like that.

234
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:56,568
What if you didn't have a case on murder?
Would you let that go?

235
00:15:56,736 --> 00:16:00,433
You'd let somebody stab people because
you didn't have a catalog number on it?

236
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:02,631
- Oh, don't be silly.
- This is the same thing.

237
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:05,208
- It's exactly the same thing.
- All right, all right.

238
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:09,109
- Send in your report. Send it in, send it in.
- Attaboy, Harry. Thank you, Harry.

239
00:16:09,282 --> 00:16:13,082
I'm just trying to keep things
in perspective around here, that's all.

240
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:17,217
Afternoon mail.

241
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,019
Don't we never get
any magazines anymore?

242
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:23,389
- Oh, hi, Chip.
- Hi, Sam.

243
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:26,360
- There was a call for you from the library.
- Yeah.

244
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:30,962
How do you suppose a fella
like Harry ever got into the bureau?

245
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:36,233
- Breaking and entering. Clear violation.
- Yeah.

246
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:39,308
Some state bigwig pushed it
to get him off their payroll.

247
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:40,968
Well, well, well.

248
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:45,174
Drop your paper clips, everybody.
We're gonna take a trip, on the house.

249
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:48,479
Now, in the first place,
the bureau's got a new director.

250
00:16:48,654 --> 00:16:53,284
"Special Agent in Charge, SAC Dakins,
Agent Hardesty and Agent Crandall...

251
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,791
...are hereby instructed
to report to Washington...

252
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:59,158
...at 9:00 on the morning
of May 29."

253
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:01,698
That's good.
Now you can tell them about the fan.

254
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:04,358
And don't think I won't.

255
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,132
Sure. Sure, you will.

256
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:09,274
- Hey, what do you suppose it means?
- I don't know.

257
00:17:10,242 --> 00:17:13,302
All right, everybody, get your paperwork
all straightened out, now.

258
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:15,379
I'll be at the library, Harry.

259
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:18,044
- Good luck.
- Yeah, thanks.

260
00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:19,741
Yeah.

261
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:29,354
Good morning.

262
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,961
I wonder, do you happen
to have that book?

263
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:44,266
Well, if we do, it'll be
in the Mystery section.

264
00:17:44,443 --> 00:17:47,173
- I'll show you.
- Thank you.

265
00:18:05,464 --> 00:18:09,025
Darling, not every day.
Somebody's going to notice.

266
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:11,536
Nobody can read books quite that fast.

267
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:13,501
You've got nothing
to worry about, Lucy.

268
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:16,641
I always pick books with large print,
you see.

269
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:18,037
Oh, I'm sorry.

270
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,771
You know, I wish they'd sort of
spread things out here a little.

271
00:18:21,947 --> 00:18:24,415
Kind of cramped in here.

272
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,518
Look at all these books, too.

273
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:31,747
It's not very romantic, kissing somebody
right in the middle of the murder section.

274
00:18:31,924 --> 00:18:33,516
You've got a better suggestion?

275
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:39,330
Well, as a matter of fact, I have.
That's why I came over.

276
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,825
Lucy, I think we ought to get married.

277
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,700
Married? Well, right away?

278
00:18:47,873 --> 00:18:50,501
Oh, no, tomorrow
will be soon enough, I think.

279
00:18:51,243 --> 00:18:52,938
Chip, you're crazy.

280
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:56,275
You can't just go get married
like ordering a ham sandwich.

281
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:58,144
You can if you're hungry.

282
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:02,645
We love each other, don't we?

283
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:05,847
Well, why tomorrow?

284
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:09,392
Well, you see, word has just come in
that I have to go to Washington...

285
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:10,893
...at the end of the month.

286
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:14,499
And I'm not sure when I'll be back.
I'm not sure I'll ever be back at all.

287
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:16,134
You know, I may be transferred.

288
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:20,068
So we'll have to get married right away,
and then we can work in a honeymoon.

289
00:19:22,174 --> 00:19:24,074
Well, it's impossible.

290
00:19:26,111 --> 00:19:28,602
Why, you don't think
your folks would approve?

291
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:30,578
No, that's not it.

292
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:32,842
- I won't.
- What?

293
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:35,282
Now, we've talked
about this before, Chip.

294
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:39,015
Well, you mean my job, huh?

295
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,123
I love you very much, Chip.

296
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:45,695
But I wouldn't marry you tomorrow
or any other day...

297
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:47,662
...as long as you work for that bureau.

298
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:51,030
- You're not being fair.
- I don't think you're being fair to yourself.

299
00:19:51,203 --> 00:19:54,536
You spent five years getting a degree.
Working and going to school.

300
00:19:54,707 --> 00:19:57,733
And then you get stuck
in some dinky little rut.

301
00:19:58,143 --> 00:20:02,512
I'm not against government work, Chip,
but, well, do something important.

302
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:06,583
Well, honey, I'm awful sorry.
They just wouldn't let me start as a senator.

303
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:09,580
Now, that's not what I mean,
and you know it.

304
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:12,918
I'm not looking for a lot of money
or a big mansion.

305
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:15,652
I just hate to see you sliding along,
year after year...

306
00:20:15,828 --> 00:20:18,422
...with nothing to show for it
except a payroll number...

307
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:22,761
...and maybe a pat on the back
from some political appointee.

308
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:25,301
You're too good for that, Chip.

309
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:28,471
Well...

310
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:31,466
...I guess that's pretty clear, isn't it?

311
00:20:33,145 --> 00:20:34,772
I hope so.

312
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:37,172
Well, Lucy, let me ask you something.

313
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:39,977
If I were to leave the bureau,
would you marry me then?

314
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:42,280
Let me ask you something.

315
00:20:42,454 --> 00:20:44,547
How much would you really mind
giving it up?

316
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:47,021
Now, be honest, Chip.
It's not that good a job.

317
00:20:47,192 --> 00:20:48,750
You've said so yourself.

318
00:20:48,928 --> 00:20:50,953
Well, I know, that's true, but...

319
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,657
I know there isn't much reason
for me to stay, but I...

320
00:20:58,137 --> 00:21:02,096
Well, anyway, I think I'd give up anything
to marry you, Lucy.

321
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:04,472
I really would.

322
00:21:05,044 --> 00:21:08,104
Well, then, stop stalling and do it.

323
00:21:11,116 --> 00:21:14,517
Well, now, I still have to go
to Washington to resign.

324
00:21:15,421 --> 00:21:17,753
And I have to go to work.

325
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:30,827
I wonder who she's meeting in here.

326
00:21:41,413 --> 00:21:43,938
"Do you, John Michael Hardesty...

327
00:21:44,116 --> 00:21:47,711
...accept in holy matrimony this woman,
for better or for worse...

328
00:21:47,886 --> 00:21:51,754
...in sickness or in health,
until death do you part?"

329
00:21:51,924 --> 00:21:53,152
I do.

330
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,859
"Do you, Lucy Ann Ballard...

331
00:21:56,028 --> 00:22:00,021
...accept in holy matrimony this man,
for better or for worse...

332
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:04,465
...in sickness or in health,
until death do you part?"

333
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:05,695
I do.

334
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:19,015
Then, as a minister
and servant of God...

335
00:22:19,184 --> 00:22:23,746
...I pronounce you bound
in holy matrimony.

336
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:35,395
I'll get the car.

337
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:39,929
Oh, baby, you just look beautiful.

338
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:43,563
I'm glad, son, about your going into
the law business for yourself.

339
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:45,903
- It's a right smart move.
- Thank you very much.

340
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:48,046
I'm sorry about all the rush,
Mrs. Ballard.

341
00:22:48,213 --> 00:22:51,239
- Guess it wasn't a very big wedding.
- Don't you worry about that.

342
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:56,282
Anybody here for a honeymoon?

343
00:22:56,455 --> 00:23:00,186
I just might take a chance on that.
Honey, we have to go. Let's go.

344
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,883
- Goodbye, baby.
- You look great.

345
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:04,427
- Congratulations.
- Goodbye, Lucy.

346
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:11,361
- We got the tent and everything?
- Yeah, yeah.

347
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:16,130
- Good luck. I hope the fish are biting.
- I was kind of hoping they wouldn't be.

348
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:19,641
Remember, be on that Washington train
the 28th. I'll board at Asheville.

349
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:22,076
- Fine. All right.
- Bye.

350
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:39,497
For the next two or three weeks,
Lucy and I went bass fishing.

351
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:41,390
We...

352
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:44,092
We didn't catch anything,
but I guess that's because...

353
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:47,602
...the car never got stuck
in a big enough lake.

354
00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:58,706
We had nice accommodations, though.

355
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:05,347
A semiprivate room
with running water.

356
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:10,953
Lucy said for our next honeymoon...

357
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,327
...she'd like to make reservations
at a good desert.

358
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,800
Anyway, toward the end of that month,
we got the train for Washington.

359
00:24:33,252 --> 00:24:35,777
Sam Crandall was already aboard.

360
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:38,984
He didn't seem too happy
for some reason or other.

361
00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:40,955
Hi, Sam.

362
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:47,955
And it didn't take him long
to get to the point.

363
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:51,200
Bring us a couple of glasses
of tomato juice, will you.

364
00:24:53,172 --> 00:24:55,902
Are you really serious about resigning?

365
00:24:56,742 --> 00:24:58,369
Show it to him.

366
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:00,739
One neatly typed resignation.

367
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:03,973
And one brand-new lawyer's shingle.

368
00:25:04,316 --> 00:25:05,715
Well, I think you're a fool.

369
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:08,512
Oh, stop it, Sam. You're just like Chip.

370
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:10,917
You don't really think
the bureau's any good.

371
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:13,387
No, but it could be.

372
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:16,653
That's the terrible part, Chip.
It could be.

373
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:19,320
Oh, I suppose, if you get
water to run uphill.

374
00:25:19,498 --> 00:25:21,625
Then it'll run uphill. We need a bureau.

375
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,927
The country's growing.
Crime will grow with it.

376
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:26,502
Oh, faddle.
We have enough policemen.

377
00:25:27,573 --> 00:25:29,370
Do you know anything
about this country?

378
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:32,533
How many crimes there are?
How many kinds of crime?

379
00:25:32,711 --> 00:25:33,939
We'll tick them off.

380
00:25:34,112 --> 00:25:38,242
There's theft, burglary, armed robbery,
forgery, perjury, treason.

381
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:41,011
At that rate, I'll be able
to pick up some clients.

382
00:25:41,753 --> 00:25:44,381
Down in Texas,
some fella stole a drawbridge.

383
00:25:44,556 --> 00:25:47,252
That's right. One whole drawbridge.

384
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:50,725
Men will steal houses,
wives and flashlights.

385
00:25:50,896 --> 00:25:53,364
They'll steal your pants, watch,
your good reputation.

386
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:56,126
You name it, they'll steal it.
Overshoes?

387
00:25:56,301 --> 00:25:59,099
An old lady stole 46 pair of them
in the middle of Arizona.

388
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:01,933
They'll steal anything,
solid, gas or rock.

389
00:26:02,107 --> 00:26:04,234
Diamonds, beer caps
and "wet paint" signs.

390
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:06,809
They'll steal them morning,
noon and night.

391
00:26:06,979 --> 00:26:09,573
They'll take anything you've got,
large, small or medium.

392
00:26:09,748 --> 00:26:11,238
Do they ever take a breath?

393
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:13,941
Now, that's just theft alone.
Now, take murder.

394
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:17,577
There's homicide, genocide, patricide,
matricide, fratricide, suicide...

395
00:26:17,756 --> 00:26:19,280
...and murder for side bets.

396
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:22,586
There's murder by poison, by gunshot,
by rocks, knives and scissors.

397
00:26:22,761 --> 00:26:24,956
All right, Sam.
We'll grant you there's crime.

398
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:29,464
All right, Sam, just cool down, now.
Just cool down.

399
00:26:30,702 --> 00:26:33,034
That's the difference between us, Chip.

400
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:35,036
I never wanna cool off.

401
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:36,731
Never.

402
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:38,536
Excuse me.

403
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:49,650
Please, Chip,
don't let him talk you into it.

404
00:26:50,355 --> 00:26:52,380
What do you mean? Lucy, what?

405
00:26:52,557 --> 00:26:54,650
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

406
00:26:54,826 --> 00:26:56,760
Yes, you do.

407
00:26:57,162 --> 00:26:59,926
Just don't try to make water run uphill.
Please don't.

408
00:27:00,098 --> 00:27:01,429
What?

409
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,974
I am your new director.
I did not ask for the position...

410
00:27:10,142 --> 00:27:13,737
...but now that I have it,
I intend to give it the best I have.

411
00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:16,142
I took the position on one condition:

412
00:27:16,315 --> 00:27:20,752
That the bureau would be free of politics
and would be operated on a merit basis.

413
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:24,616
This means the bureau
will operate solely on efficiency...

414
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:28,692
...with trained lawyers, accountants,
technicians and clerks.

415
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,126
From now on, we're going
to be known simply as the FBI.

416
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:35,391
We're going to streamline
our operations...

417
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:38,559
...and do much more work
than we have done before.

418
00:27:38,737 --> 00:27:41,331
And we are going to do it as a team.

419
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,005
The new FBI will not be the product
of one individual.

420
00:27:45,177 --> 00:27:48,874
No one man can build it,
but one man can pull it down.

421
00:27:49,047 --> 00:27:52,346
Henceforth, it will be
a "we" organization.

422
00:27:52,517 --> 00:27:55,680
This bureau will be dedicated
not merely to justice...

423
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:57,321
...but to the love of justice.

424
00:27:57,622 --> 00:27:58,953
I warn you now...

425
00:27:59,124 --> 00:28:01,592
...that is the most demanding
of affections.

426
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,059
It will take all your vigilance,
patience and loyalty.

427
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,528
And it will mean sacrifice,
much sacrifice...

428
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:10,566
...to you and the members
of your family.

429
00:28:10,736 --> 00:28:13,967
In the end, it will offer you
only one reward.

430
00:28:14,139 --> 00:28:16,937
You may not die rich men,
but you will die men...

431
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:20,272
...dedicated to fidelity,
bravery and integrity.

432
00:28:20,445 --> 00:28:21,912
Thank you.

433
00:28:34,693 --> 00:28:36,422
What do you think
of the new director?

434
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:40,156
He sounds like he just might be able
to get water to run uphill, doesn't he?

435
00:28:40,332 --> 00:28:42,527
Well, Chip, I hear you're gonna resign.

436
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:44,794
You're smart. I'm getting out myself.

437
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:48,929
The way this fella's gonna run things,
the only future you've got is being dead.

438
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,305
That Mr. Hoover
sure sounded specific, didn't he?

439
00:29:19,971 --> 00:29:21,268
- Hi.
- Hi.

440
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,668
You look wonderful.

441
00:29:22,841 --> 00:29:25,401
You wanted shrimp.
This is the best place in Washington.

442
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:26,942
I got it straight from a fish.

443
00:29:27,112 --> 00:29:28,704
- How did things go?
- Just wonderful.

444
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,940
This new fella's got drive.
He's really going to do something.

445
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:33,982
What did they say
about your resignation?

446
00:29:34,152 --> 00:29:36,950
We don't need a menu.
Give us a big plate of steamed shrimp.

447
00:29:37,122 --> 00:29:38,646
Right out of the pot, huh?

448
00:29:39,024 --> 00:29:41,424
Were they angry when you told them
you were quitting?

449
00:29:41,593 --> 00:29:43,026
You're gonna love these shrimp.

450
00:29:43,195 --> 00:29:46,255
They're in the shell. And you break
them open and dip them into...

451
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:49,195
- Didn't they say anything?
- I don't know why they're so big.

452
00:29:49,367 --> 00:29:53,701
- I guess the mother shrimp lays big eggs.
- I don't wanna hear the history of a shrimp.

453
00:29:53,872 --> 00:29:55,430
You don't?

454
00:29:57,342 --> 00:29:59,105
Give it to me.

455
00:29:59,277 --> 00:30:01,006
Oh, yeah.

456
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:03,804
Why, Chip? I thought we'd agreed.

457
00:30:03,982 --> 00:30:07,941
I know, I know. I just think it might
help me out if I stayed a while.

458
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,615
- How long?
- A couple of years.

459
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:13,417
I could really learn a lot
in this new setup, Lucy.

460
00:30:13,592 --> 00:30:16,891
Criminology, new techniques.
Make a lot better lawyer.

461
00:30:17,529 --> 00:30:20,362
You don't have to be Clarence Darrow
the first week.

462
00:30:20,532 --> 00:30:22,124
Besides, we have to settle down...

463
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,996
...and start leading our life
the way we intend to lead it.

464
00:30:25,237 --> 00:30:27,637
Honey, they're gonna start
a whole training program.

465
00:30:27,806 --> 00:30:30,070
They'll have an academy
for local police officers.

466
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:33,211
They're gonna build up the laboratory,
the identification system.

467
00:30:33,378 --> 00:30:35,903
This fella really means it.
Now, you'll see. You just...

468
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:40,381
Oh, here are the shrimp. There we are.
Now, just wait till you taste these.

469
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:43,916
Oh, boy, we got some big ones there.

470
00:30:44,089 --> 00:30:47,024
That's it, that's it.
Very good, very good.

471
00:30:47,192 --> 00:30:48,921
There we are.

472
00:30:49,094 --> 00:30:51,756
Now...
Now, I'll show you how it works.

473
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,921
I'll have some ice cream.

474
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:57,091
- Yeah, well, bring some ice cream. Later.
- Now.

475
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:59,396
You don't want ice cream
and shrimp together.

476
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:01,095
They don't go very good together.

477
00:31:01,907 --> 00:31:06,537
I'm going to have some ice cream,
and I'm going to eat it with my shrimp.

478
00:31:06,711 --> 00:31:09,839
That's another reason why I think
we should settle down.

479
00:31:10,015 --> 00:31:12,074
I wanted shrimp and ice cream
this morning.

480
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,185
And yesterday. And the day before.

481
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:17,884
Hasn't anyone told you
what it means...

482
00:31:18,056 --> 00:31:20,718
...when a woman has a craving
for strange foods?

483
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:27,496
You mean you're gonna have a baby?

484
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:30,999
You...

485
00:31:31,303 --> 00:31:32,770
You...

486
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,334
Well, don't just stand there,
get some ice cream.

487
00:31:43,615 --> 00:31:44,604
Two scoops.

488
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:50,745
This isn't a trick or something?
Are you really gonna have a baby?

489
00:31:51,623 --> 00:31:54,057
Well, I presume it'll be a baby.

490
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:03,995
Lucy, I'm sorry.
I ought to be shot or something.

491
00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:07,070
Give me that resignation.
I'll turn it in first thing tomorrow.

492
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:08,467
No, no.

493
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,268
No, I think I'll save it for a year or so.

494
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:13,836
That won't be necessary.
I'm willing to quit.

495
00:32:14,012 --> 00:32:16,310
I know, I know.

496
00:32:16,648 --> 00:32:20,607
I told that minister
I'd give you everything you need in life.

497
00:32:20,952 --> 00:32:23,113
Maybe you need this.

498
00:32:23,722 --> 00:32:26,282
I might even throw in a son
for good measure.

499
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:30,859
Lucy, I just want you to know
that I've never been as happy...

500
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:32,963
...as I am right at this moment.

501
00:32:34,432 --> 00:32:37,458
Oh, that's just because
you like big shrimp.

502
00:32:39,704 --> 00:32:41,797
I guess I do, at that. Here, have one.

503
00:32:45,644 --> 00:32:48,511
I wonder where
that fella is with the ice cream.

504
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:53,916
That was our last afternoon
in Washington.

505
00:32:54,085 --> 00:32:58,317
The next day, Sam and I were sent
down South with five other agents.

506
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,186
We were given simple instructions:

507
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:05,796
To check on a group of terrorists
known as the Ku Klux Klan.

508
00:33:06,665 --> 00:33:09,293
They had one minor complaint:

509
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:11,594
They didn't like the Bill of Rights.

510
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,364
They said so in speeches.

511
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:17,164
They said so
in a lot of different ways.

512
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:22,246
They ransacked homes...

513
00:33:24,015 --> 00:33:26,984
...and defiled ancient devotions.

514
00:33:32,424 --> 00:33:35,052
It was a secret organization...

515
00:33:35,226 --> 00:33:39,424
...that was so powerful
it didn't have to be secret.

516
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:43,595
But, month after month,
we weren't much help.

517
00:33:45,036 --> 00:33:47,266
We couldn't find witnesses.

518
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:50,806
And when we did,
they were afraid to testify.

519
00:33:50,975 --> 00:33:54,172
So far, we didn't have anything
that would stand up in court.

520
00:34:32,951 --> 00:34:35,545
- How's Lucy?
- I don't know. They got her in there.

521
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,517
They won't tell you anything.

522
00:34:37,689 --> 00:34:39,953
- Isn't that awful, out in the street there?
- Yeah.

523
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:42,423
- What's this?
- Walter Craig's in trouble. Come on.

524
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:44,221
Well, what about Lucy?

525
00:34:44,396 --> 00:34:47,092
I'm afraid she'll have to make this trip
without you, Chip.

526
00:34:47,265 --> 00:34:48,630
Well, I...

527
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,938
Hey, tell them
I'll be right back, will you?

528
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,306
Walter Craig was the editor
of a local newspaper.

529
00:35:08,052 --> 00:35:10,612
He couldn't be bribed...

530
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:13,319
...he couldn't be muzzled...

531
00:35:13,725 --> 00:35:16,091
...but he could be murdered.

532
00:35:19,597 --> 00:35:20,894
Get out of here!

533
00:35:21,065 --> 00:35:23,499
Get out of here, you hoodlums.

534
00:35:23,868 --> 00:35:25,597
Get out of here.

535
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,102
Get out of here, I said!

536
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:53,594
All right, fellas, in the truck.

537
00:35:57,836 --> 00:35:59,326
- Where's the truck?
- Where is it?

538
00:35:59,504 --> 00:36:01,529
It's supposed to be here.

539
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:04,765
Craig, we're taking you out to the lake,
and you're going fishing.

540
00:36:04,943 --> 00:36:08,071
- In fact, you're gonna be the fish.
- You've heard of bottom fishing.

541
00:36:08,246 --> 00:36:10,146
We're gonna tie you up,
weight you down...

542
00:36:10,315 --> 00:36:12,180
...and put you on the bottom.

543
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:18,182
Here's the truck.

544
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,951
Hold it, hold it.

545
00:36:31,903 --> 00:36:35,339
Hey, one of you drivers come back here
and close these tailgates.

546
00:36:44,516 --> 00:36:47,952
All right, I don't think you guys
are gonna like this trip.

547
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,986
FBI. Come on, let's roll them.

548
00:36:53,157 --> 00:36:56,524
Our next assignment
took us out to the Coast.

549
00:36:57,529 --> 00:37:00,623
Two children later, we returned.

550
00:37:01,699 --> 00:37:04,293
It wasn't easy to plan things.

551
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:06,733
One birthday,
I got roller skates for Mike...

552
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:11,001
...and two weeks later,
we were transferred to a farm district.

553
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:14,701
I finally bought him
an old sway-backed horse.

554
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:19,613
And Lucy said she guessed Mr. Hoover
must have heard about that...

555
00:37:19,784 --> 00:37:22,378
...because a month afterwards,
we were sent to Cleveland.

556
00:37:22,554 --> 00:37:23,680
We were there a while.

557
00:37:24,822 --> 00:37:27,222
During that time,
I was sent on special assignment...

558
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:31,590
...to Ute City,
Wade County, Oklahoma.

559
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:34,593
Money was at the bottom of things.

560
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:37,564
Money and Indians.

561
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:42,103
For years, they owned small pieces
of worthless land.

562
00:37:42,273 --> 00:37:46,642
With a little rain and patience,
a good farmer could grow mud...

563
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:48,711
...that's about all.

564
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,939
But oil was discovered,
and the Indians were suddenly rich.

565
00:37:53,284 --> 00:37:56,344
And they had so much money,
they didn't know how to spend it.

566
00:37:56,521 --> 00:38:00,082
But a few salesmen showed them how.

567
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:03,791
For instance, Harry Willowtree.

568
00:38:03,962 --> 00:38:08,296
He had three convertibles
until it rained on him one day.

569
00:38:09,434 --> 00:38:11,925
I saw a lot of examples.

570
00:38:13,104 --> 00:38:15,868
Like Dan Savagehorse.

571
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,531
He built himself a nice house...

572
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:22,043
...but the side yard
didn't look too good.

573
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:25,512
He met a plumbing salesman...

574
00:38:25,683 --> 00:38:28,675
...and Dan happened to like bathtubs.

575
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:34,621
Dan's father was different.
He stayed on in the same house.

576
00:38:34,926 --> 00:38:38,089
But he'd always wanted a telephone.

577
00:38:38,262 --> 00:38:40,355
So he got one.

578
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:43,364
Not many calls ever came in...

579
00:38:43,735 --> 00:38:47,262
...but if one ever did,
he sure was ready for it.

580
00:38:53,478 --> 00:38:56,413
That was the silly side of things.

581
00:38:56,581 --> 00:38:59,379
The other side was a little more serious.

582
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,678
Instead of selling things
to the Indians...

583
00:39:03,588 --> 00:39:05,852
...somebody was killing them.

584
00:39:06,624 --> 00:39:09,115
And that somebody made a mistake.

585
00:39:09,293 --> 00:39:12,353
He killed an Indian on government land.

586
00:39:12,764 --> 00:39:15,597
The FBI moved into the case.

587
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:19,968
The sequence was always the same:

588
00:39:20,204 --> 00:39:21,831
An Indian was killed.

589
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:23,667
Right afterwards...

590
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:27,641
...someone showed up
with a mortgage to claim his estate.

591
00:39:27,812 --> 00:39:31,077
Each time it was a different person.
Each time it looked legal.

592
00:39:31,249 --> 00:39:34,150
In fact, it looked too legal.

593
00:39:34,552 --> 00:39:36,918
But it wasn't easy to prove.

594
00:39:37,255 --> 00:39:39,723
I'd been there for months
posing as a cattle dealer.

595
00:39:41,392 --> 00:39:43,952
So far, I hadn't turned up anything.

596
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,195
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

597
00:39:48,366 --> 00:39:50,527
Oh, you look tired.

598
00:39:51,636 --> 00:39:55,003
Well, I'm not as tired as an Indian
by the name of Johnny Mountain.

599
00:39:55,173 --> 00:39:57,300
Somebody shot him tonight.

600
00:39:57,475 --> 00:40:00,569
- No evidence?
- Nope, nothing.

601
00:40:00,778 --> 00:40:03,144
Oh, are these those little pickles?

602
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:07,918
What about...?
Should you be sitting down?

603
00:40:09,053 --> 00:40:11,453
- Did you see the doctor today?
- I'll be fine.

604
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:16,720
Mike, will you get that gun
and get out of here.

605
00:40:16,894 --> 00:40:18,657
Now, go on, beat it.

606
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,798
Go on, now, beat it!

607
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:24,330
Honey, I'm sorry.
But would you please speak to the kid?

608
00:40:24,502 --> 00:40:27,198
- I will, Chip.
- He's got to get over the idea...

609
00:40:27,371 --> 00:40:30,204
...that every time I come home,
I've got to out-draw him.

610
00:40:30,374 --> 00:40:33,138
I said, I'd talk to him.

611
00:40:33,377 --> 00:40:36,210
Well, I guess I had to
blame it on somebody.

612
00:40:36,481 --> 00:40:39,416
Oh, here, I'll do that.
Now, you shouldn't bend over like that.

613
00:40:39,584 --> 00:40:41,449
- Watch the glass.
- I'm all right. I will.

614
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:43,052
Watch it.

615
00:40:43,254 --> 00:40:46,849
You know, it isn't just these poor
people getting killed every few days.

616
00:40:47,024 --> 00:40:49,151
How do they feel about me
back at the bureau?

617
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:51,727
- They understand.
- How can they understand?

618
00:40:51,896 --> 00:40:54,660
Somebody gets killed, I send in my report.
What does it say?

619
00:40:54,832 --> 00:40:56,823
"Have verified one dead Indian."

620
00:40:57,001 --> 00:40:58,332
- Oh, stop it, Chip.
- No.

621
00:40:58,503 --> 00:41:02,166
I've never been
so discouraged about anything.

622
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,601
This thing, it just...

623
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,471
Lucy, when you speak to Mike...

624
00:41:07,645 --> 00:41:10,773
...you can also tell him
he ruined the pickles.

625
00:41:13,918 --> 00:41:18,014
At 8: 15 that night,
Bill Smith and his Indian wife, Rita...

626
00:41:18,189 --> 00:41:20,248
...sat down to dinner.

627
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:24,224
They had ham, squash and boiled beans...

628
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:26,795
...and tapioca pudding for dessert.

629
00:41:26,964 --> 00:41:30,024
Except they never had
a chance to finish it.

630
00:41:31,669 --> 00:41:34,331
Instead, they got five gallons
of nitroglycerin...

631
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:37,235
...and two professional killers.

632
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:37,130
- Marshal?
- Yeah.

633
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:39,326
This wire's about all we can find.

634
00:42:39,503 --> 00:42:42,563
Well, it's just common stuff.
But you better check it out anyway.

635
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,173
All right.

636
00:42:45,443 --> 00:42:48,537
Oh, excuse me, marshal.
This nice couple that just died.

637
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:50,806
I don't suppose you'd know
the next of kin?

638
00:42:50,982 --> 00:42:53,416
- No, why?
- I represent the Ever-Rest People.

639
00:42:53,584 --> 00:42:54,983
Caskets and funeral hardware.

640
00:42:55,419 --> 00:42:57,751
I'd like to do something real nice
for this couple.

641
00:42:58,556 --> 00:43:01,184
Now, here's a rundown
on our new line.

642
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:05,853
Walnut, maple, dignified mahogany.

643
00:43:06,397 --> 00:43:08,558
Satin lining in seven different shades.

644
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:11,224
Blue, yellow, pink,
official Osage colors.

645
00:43:11,402 --> 00:43:14,735
I said I didn't know the next of kin.
Now, move on.

646
00:43:15,673 --> 00:43:17,140
Yes, sir.

647
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:20,639
All of you, clear out, please.

648
00:43:20,811 --> 00:43:23,279
- All right, you too.
- Oh, he's all right, marshal.

649
00:43:23,447 --> 00:43:26,245
I can vouch for him.
He's a cattle dealer.

650
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:27,850
He trades down in my bank.

651
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:29,987
I'm much obliged to you,
Mr. McCutcheon.

652
00:43:30,154 --> 00:43:33,055
I'm sorry to be touchy,
but every time there's a murder here...

653
00:43:33,224 --> 00:43:35,419
...the people either hide
or sell caskets.

654
00:43:35,693 --> 00:43:38,127
You all have a reason to think
it's murder, marshal?

655
00:43:38,629 --> 00:43:42,395
One reason is there used to be
a house here with people living in it.

656
00:43:42,566 --> 00:43:46,127
You wanna know if it's murder?
Take a look at these oil wells.

657
00:43:46,304 --> 00:43:49,330
Bill and Rita Smith held head rights
on eight more just like them.

658
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:53,500
We're getting a mighty rich
graveyard in this town.

659
00:43:53,678 --> 00:43:56,374
And nobody's doing much about it.

660
00:43:56,547 --> 00:43:58,447
Look at the FBI.

661
00:43:58,749 --> 00:44:00,910
We asked them for help.

662
00:44:01,118 --> 00:44:03,518
We never heard a word from them.

663
00:44:03,688 --> 00:44:07,624
Oh, I'm sorry, marshal,
if I sound bitter...

664
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:10,522
...but this hits me close to home.

665
00:44:10,962 --> 00:44:13,829
Close to home? Just how is that, sir?

666
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:17,033
Well, I won't bother you about it.

667
00:44:17,401 --> 00:44:20,962
Oh, say, Mr. McCutcheon, I was thinking
about going down to Fort Worth...

668
00:44:21,138 --> 00:44:22,799
...stocking up on white-faced cows.

669
00:44:22,974 --> 00:44:26,341
I was wondering, could you give me
a letter of introduction or something?

670
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:29,411
Well, I'd be glad to.
You drop by the bank tomorrow.

671
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,708
I sure would appreciate that.
Thank you, sir.

672
00:44:34,986 --> 00:44:37,511
Anybody see this happen, marshal?

673
00:44:38,589 --> 00:44:40,284
You don't know this town.

674
00:44:40,458 --> 00:44:43,825
Somebody could blow up a house
in front of a grandstand full of people...

675
00:44:43,995 --> 00:44:45,462
...and you know what they'd say?

676
00:44:45,629 --> 00:44:48,223
They all had a cinder in their eye,
they couldn't see it.

677
00:44:48,499 --> 00:44:50,364
All we get is casket salesmen.

678
00:44:50,534 --> 00:44:55,028
Just the same, marshal, that fella
asked a pretty good question.

679
00:44:55,439 --> 00:44:57,771
Who is the next of kin?

680
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:17,185
Damnable black juice in the ground.

681
00:45:17,361 --> 00:45:20,853
This was a decent little cow town
when I started the bank here...

682
00:45:21,032 --> 00:45:24,365
...before the easy pickings
brought in all this scum.

683
00:45:24,702 --> 00:45:28,365
You mentioned something last night
about hitting close to home?

684
00:45:29,273 --> 00:45:31,503
Albert here is my nephew.

685
00:45:31,675 --> 00:45:35,543
His wife, Mollie, a full-blooded Osage...

686
00:45:35,713 --> 00:45:39,911
...is a sister to Rita Smith,
who died in that explosion last night.

687
00:45:40,084 --> 00:45:43,144
Oh, I see. I'm mighty sorry
for you and the missus.

688
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,083
Thank you, sir.

689
00:45:45,556 --> 00:45:49,890
Things keep up this way,
we've got to form our own vigilantes...

690
00:45:50,061 --> 00:45:53,326
...if the FBI is scared
to move in here and help us.

691
00:45:53,497 --> 00:45:56,591
I'll bet my bottom dollar they'll get
around to it, Mr. McCutcheon.

692
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:58,394
I'll take that bet.

693
00:45:58,569 --> 00:46:01,970
White-collared bunch of scissorbills.

694
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:05,834
They'd even get shoved off
the sidewalk. Now, here.

695
00:46:06,077 --> 00:46:10,537
This is your letter to the chairman of the
Cattle Show Committee in Fort Worth.

696
00:46:10,714 --> 00:46:14,309
They all know Dwight McCutcheon
down there.

697
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:16,851
That letter will get you
the best deals in Texas.

698
00:46:17,021 --> 00:46:19,581
You're real folks, Mr. McCutcheon.
I sure appreciate it.

699
00:46:19,757 --> 00:46:21,748
- Good luck, son.
- Thank you, sir.

700
00:46:21,926 --> 00:46:24,326
Thank you. Maybe I can do
something for you someday.

701
00:46:24,495 --> 00:46:26,326
Goodbye.

702
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:31,667
Who's gonna be the next lucky man?
Here's a dollar.

703
00:46:31,836 --> 00:46:34,737
Sir, you got a bottle. Who's next?
Yes, look at that mustache.

704
00:46:34,905 --> 00:46:36,930
It'll grow another yard.
Who's the happy guy?

705
00:46:37,108 --> 00:46:39,167
Yes, sir, one dollar. Anybody else?

706
00:46:39,343 --> 00:46:42,107
Look what I got here.
Chief Red Eagle's Old Reliable.

707
00:46:42,279 --> 00:46:45,077
Yes, sir, this bottle
contains real vitalizer.

708
00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:47,114
Don't settle for memories.
Live again.

709
00:46:47,284 --> 00:46:50,048
Come on, buy a bottle
and surprise your friends.

710
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:53,019
Good for cuts, bruises, abrasions...

711
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:56,682
...torn ligaments and an aching back.

712
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:11,174
Hey, you ladies over there,
you're gonna need it.

713
00:47:14,111 --> 00:47:15,976
Folks, come on, step back.

714
00:47:16,147 --> 00:47:19,173
Look, it's all over. Don't leave me
up here a Ionely man. Come on.

715
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,648
Once in a lifetime, a golden opportunity.

716
00:47:21,819 --> 00:47:25,016
Gives back your youth, your health
and a certain twinkle in your eye.

717
00:47:25,189 --> 00:47:27,316
Ladies and gentlemen,
you see the way it is.

718
00:47:27,491 --> 00:47:29,516
Now, those girls should have a policy.

719
00:47:29,693 --> 00:47:32,355
Now, step right up,
ladies and gentlemen, don't be shy.

720
00:47:32,796 --> 00:47:36,357
Now, we don't recommend the annuity
policy to you folks of Wade County.

721
00:47:36,834 --> 00:47:39,928
But this straight life-insurance policy
might come in handy.

722
00:47:40,104 --> 00:47:42,971
Especially for you, Henry Roanhorse.

723
00:47:53,784 --> 00:47:56,344
Thought I could talk that Indian
into buying a policy.

724
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,283
You know, he's a cousin to Rita Smith.

725
00:47:58,455 --> 00:48:00,719
The one that got blown
to kingdom come last night.

726
00:48:00,891 --> 00:48:04,520
- Oh, is that so?
- Say, maybe I could interest you in a policy.

727
00:48:04,695 --> 00:48:09,655
- Lot of killing's going on around here.
- No, I don't think so.

728
00:48:10,034 --> 00:48:11,695
Yeah, well, I guess you're safe.

729
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:15,032
A fella as thin as you are,
nobody'd know where to find you.

730
00:48:15,206 --> 00:48:17,299
All right, folks, step right up.

731
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:26,880
That night, Henry Roanhorse
took a ride out into the country.

732
00:48:28,118 --> 00:48:32,350
Somebody killed him and left him
with a coyote to blow taps.

733
00:48:40,965 --> 00:48:43,866
If anybody asks you, just say
I'm at the Fort Worth stock show.

734
00:48:44,034 --> 00:48:45,296
How long will you be gone?

735
00:48:45,469 --> 00:48:47,437
Long enough to go over
to the courthouse...

736
00:48:47,605 --> 00:48:49,232
...and check on a couple of wills.

737
00:48:49,406 --> 00:48:51,340
Bill and Rita Smith's?

738
00:48:51,575 --> 00:48:53,099
That's right.

739
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:57,806
Oh, Chip, look at these socks.
They don't even match.

740
00:48:57,982 --> 00:48:59,449
How do you expect them to match?

741
00:48:59,617 --> 00:49:01,710
Mike keeps grabbing them
for marble sacks.

742
00:49:01,885 --> 00:49:04,547
It wasn't for marble sacks,
it was to keep a toad.

743
00:49:06,724 --> 00:49:08,521
Oh, no. Another frayed collar.

744
00:49:08,692 --> 00:49:10,819
Honestly, I don't know
how that happens.

745
00:49:10,995 --> 00:49:13,930
Well, honey,
I guess I do that with my neck.

746
00:49:14,298 --> 00:49:16,960
Well, the tail isn't frayed.

747
00:49:17,134 --> 00:49:21,230
- At least you're not lazy.
- Oh, well, thank you, dear.

748
00:49:22,606 --> 00:49:25,336
- I love you.
- I love you too.

749
00:49:26,944 --> 00:49:29,344
Suppose the wills
are all registered and legal?

750
00:49:29,513 --> 00:49:31,538
- Then what's going to happen?
- I don't know.

751
00:49:31,715 --> 00:49:34,206
We'll just have to post
a notice with those Indians...

752
00:49:34,385 --> 00:49:36,979
...and tell them to get together
and stop being Indians.

753
00:49:37,154 --> 00:49:39,281
- All right, honey, stay off your feet.
- Okay.

754
00:49:39,456 --> 00:49:41,014
I'll be back in a couple of days.

755
00:49:41,191 --> 00:49:43,091
- Okay, bye.
- Goodbye.

756
00:49:44,295 --> 00:49:46,263
Be careful.

757
00:49:55,973 --> 00:49:59,170
Bill and Rita Smith had filed a will.

758
00:49:59,343 --> 00:50:01,811
So had Henry Roanhorse.

759
00:50:01,979 --> 00:50:04,641
The beneficiary was Mollie...

760
00:50:04,815 --> 00:50:08,251
...the wife
of Dwight McCutcheon's nephew.

761
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:10,680
Everything looked legal.

762
00:50:10,888 --> 00:50:13,516
But just to be on the safe side...

763
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:18,321
...I sent the material
to the FBI laboratory in Washington.

764
00:50:18,629 --> 00:50:21,223
I sent one other thing:

765
00:50:21,398 --> 00:50:24,993
The letter of introduction
Dwight McCutcheon had given me.

766
00:50:29,807 --> 00:50:32,435
At the laboratory,
document experts studied...

767
00:50:32,609 --> 00:50:35,271
...Dwight McCutcheon's
letter of introduction.

768
00:50:35,446 --> 00:50:39,280
They compared it
with the Photostat mortgages.

769
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:41,918
Within an hour,
they'd reached a conclusion:

770
00:50:42,086 --> 00:50:45,817
All the documents
were typed on one typewriter...

771
00:50:45,989 --> 00:50:49,288
...the typewriter belonging
to Dwight McCutcheon.

772
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,488
The will of Bill and Rita Smith
was dated 1919...

773
00:50:54,665 --> 00:50:58,032
...and was also typed on
Dwight McCutcheon's typewriter...

774
00:50:58,202 --> 00:51:01,433
...a model that wasn't manufactured
until 1923.

775
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,536
Handwriting experts found
that the signature on the will...

776
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:11,875
...bore certain individual characteristics
of McCutcheon's own handwriting.

777
00:51:12,116 --> 00:51:15,711
Dwight McCutcheon
became a prime suspect for murder.

778
00:51:17,855 --> 00:51:22,155
Within 24 hours, the findings
were forwarded to me in Ute City.

779
00:51:33,003 --> 00:51:35,233
Only a few more minutes
and you're next, mister.

780
00:51:35,406 --> 00:51:36,668
Have a seat.

781
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,603
Well...

782
00:51:38,909 --> 00:51:40,968
No, I can't wait.

783
00:51:41,145 --> 00:51:44,273
You might sell me a dollar's worth
of those Cubanola cigars, though.

784
00:51:44,448 --> 00:51:46,109
Yes, sir.

785
00:51:46,417 --> 00:51:47,748
Feel like earning a living?

786
00:51:48,218 --> 00:51:49,708
I'll be there.

787
00:51:51,922 --> 00:51:54,550
- There you are.
- Thank you.

788
00:51:54,725 --> 00:51:56,022
Bye.

789
00:52:03,133 --> 00:52:06,967
Just once over lightly, Mac.
My girl likes a little scratch to it.

790
00:52:07,137 --> 00:52:08,434
Yes, sir.

791
00:52:08,605 --> 00:52:10,800
Neat, but manly.

792
00:52:28,425 --> 00:52:31,121
We're as ready as we'll ever be.

793
00:52:48,879 --> 00:52:51,575
- I'll be over at the bank.
- Right.

794
00:53:32,589 --> 00:53:35,922
This time of night, they ain't
going in there to cash a check.

795
00:53:39,296 --> 00:53:40,923
See who it is.

796
00:53:54,778 --> 00:53:58,475
Good evening. Just got back into town,
thought I'd drop by and thank your uncle.

797
00:53:58,882 --> 00:54:01,817
Well, it's kind of late.
Our books are a little out of balance.

798
00:54:01,985 --> 00:54:05,113
Well, I just...
I wanna give him these cigars.

799
00:54:06,757 --> 00:54:09,385
Well, I suppose it'll be all right.

800
00:54:19,169 --> 00:54:21,899
- It's Mr. Hardesty.
- Good evening.

801
00:54:22,072 --> 00:54:24,131
Brought you a few cigars.

802
00:54:24,408 --> 00:54:27,400
Well, now, that's real nice of you, son.

803
00:54:27,578 --> 00:54:31,639
I'd ask you to smoke one with me
if it wasn't my busy night.

804
00:54:32,616 --> 00:54:36,177
That's all right, Mr. McCutcheon.
It's my busy night too.

805
00:54:38,155 --> 00:54:41,784
FBI. You're under arrest.
The charge is murder.

806
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,458
I'd like to tell you
what we know about you...

807
00:54:45,629 --> 00:54:47,392
...then maybe you'd care to comment.

808
00:54:48,231 --> 00:54:50,290
Just a minute.

809
00:54:51,602 --> 00:54:53,968
Tag that typewriter.
It'll be a court exhibit.

810
00:54:56,006 --> 00:55:00,807
Oh, by the way, we're also gonna put
a tag on those two friends of yours.

811
00:55:01,244 --> 00:55:03,542
FBI, get your hands up. Up!

812
00:55:03,714 --> 00:55:05,113
Up!

813
00:55:06,783 --> 00:55:10,344
So there's only one little Indian left,
Mr. McCutcheon.

814
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,613
Mollie, the wife of your nephew here.

815
00:55:12,789 --> 00:55:15,189
You worked to get that whole estate
into his hands.

816
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,054
In other words, into your hands.

817
00:55:17,227 --> 00:55:20,560
You even forged Bill and Rita Smith's
signature on that phony will.

818
00:55:20,731 --> 00:55:21,959
They couldn't write.

819
00:55:22,132 --> 00:55:25,533
We checked on their oil leases.
They had to mark them with X's.

820
00:55:25,869 --> 00:55:28,702
You didn't want to leave
any possible claimants, did you?

821
00:55:28,872 --> 00:55:31,238
Henry Roanhorse, the cousin,
had to be killed too.

822
00:55:31,408 --> 00:55:34,900
- You can't prove murder.
- Oh, come off it.

823
00:55:35,078 --> 00:55:37,740
I've been surveilling
those two goons of yours for months.

824
00:55:37,914 --> 00:55:41,008
You've been meeting them
at a spot out there in the badlands...

825
00:55:41,184 --> 00:55:45,211
...by some odd coincidence, just before
and after each murder was committed.

826
00:55:45,656 --> 00:55:48,318
I'm afraid a lot of this includes you too.

827
00:55:48,692 --> 00:55:50,057
No.

828
00:55:50,227 --> 00:55:53,822
No, he's the guilty one.
I'll tell you everything he made me do.

829
00:55:53,997 --> 00:55:55,726
You'll talk us both into prison.

830
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:58,699
He made me marry Mollie.

831
00:55:58,869 --> 00:56:02,236
He planned all these things.
Johnny Mountain, Henry Roanhorse...

832
00:56:02,406 --> 00:56:04,374
Why, you...!

833
00:56:04,641 --> 00:56:07,735
All right, take his statement.
I'm gonna go call Washington.

834
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,272
Oh, by the way, Mr. McCutcheon...

835
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:16,180
...you owe me a dollar
on that bet we made.

836
00:56:16,353 --> 00:56:19,345
The FBI did come to Wade County.

837
00:56:35,072 --> 00:56:36,300
Is something wrong, doc?

838
00:56:36,473 --> 00:56:38,464
I didn't have time
to get in touch with you.

839
00:56:38,642 --> 00:56:40,906
- Don't worry, she's all right.
- What's the matter?

840
00:56:41,078 --> 00:56:44,104
I'm afraid she lost the baby.
But she's all right herself.

841
00:56:56,059 --> 00:56:57,583
Lucy.

842
00:56:59,696 --> 00:57:01,857
- Lucy.
- Chip.

843
00:57:02,299 --> 00:57:04,995
- Did he tell you?
- Lucy, are you all right?

844
00:57:05,168 --> 00:57:08,467
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Did he tell you?

845
00:57:08,638 --> 00:57:12,165
He doesn't think we'll be able
to have any more babies.

846
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:15,243
Look, honey, honey...

847
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,687
Honey...

848
00:57:25,822 --> 00:57:27,551
...that's no way to talk.

849
00:57:27,724 --> 00:57:29,624
Now, you can't lie there
with the Bible...

850
00:57:29,793 --> 00:57:32,694
...and complain about the way
the Lord does things.

851
00:57:32,863 --> 00:57:35,354
You have to be sensible, you know.

852
00:57:35,532 --> 00:57:38,831
We already have
three wonderful children.

853
00:57:41,304 --> 00:57:42,532
Toads and all?

854
00:57:42,706 --> 00:57:44,435
Sure, toads and all.

855
00:57:46,977 --> 00:57:49,639
It's just that I had such wonderful plans.

856
00:57:49,813 --> 00:57:50,802
Well, I'm sorry.

857
00:57:50,981 --> 00:57:53,814
If you want a son to become
president of the United States...

858
00:57:53,984 --> 00:57:57,283
...this just means that you have
to get him out of this batch.

859
00:57:57,454 --> 00:57:58,785
You see?

860
00:58:03,827 --> 00:58:06,728
I was already counting
on writing in the fourth name.

861
00:58:06,997 --> 00:58:08,760
Well, now, look. Look, Lucy.

862
00:58:08,932 --> 00:58:12,732
Just because somebody prints a Bible with
space so you can write in kids' names...

863
00:58:12,903 --> 00:58:15,929
...that doesn't mean that you have
to go on writing all your life.

864
00:58:16,106 --> 00:58:18,574
Here, we have our...

865
00:58:19,543 --> 00:58:21,511
Hey, hold on here. What...?

866
00:58:21,678 --> 00:58:25,842
Did you see this?
Look, there's room for 16 names there.

867
00:58:26,016 --> 00:58:27,381
Sixteen is one...

868
00:58:27,551 --> 00:58:30,452
There's more than that.
Sixteen, 17, 18, 19.

869
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:33,680
Holy mackerel,
there's room for 24 names there.

870
00:58:33,857 --> 00:58:37,088
Honey, there...
That Bible wasn't made for a family.

871
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:40,058
This is made for a troop
full of Boy Scouts.

872
00:58:44,868 --> 00:58:46,392
All right, Chip.

873
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:50,700
- I'm satisfied if you are.
- Honey, I'm satisfied.

874
00:58:51,408 --> 00:58:53,342
I'm satisfied.

875
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:55,444
And I am happy and I love you.

876
00:58:55,612 --> 00:58:57,546
Bless your heart.

877
00:58:58,114 --> 00:59:00,048
Bless your heart.

878
00:59:02,285 --> 00:59:05,345
What do you...? Do you want me
to get you an orange or something?

879
00:59:05,522 --> 00:59:06,955
- You want a glass of water?
- No.

880
00:59:07,123 --> 00:59:08,590
- Something to eat?
- No, I'm fine.

881
00:59:08,758 --> 00:59:10,623
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

882
00:59:18,034 --> 00:59:21,060
I'll tell you something right now.

883
00:59:21,972 --> 00:59:24,736
We're getting out.
We're getting out of here.

884
00:59:24,908 --> 00:59:26,899
- And we're getting out of the bureau.
- Chip.

885
00:59:27,077 --> 00:59:31,173
Stuck down here in this godforsaken place,
month after month, you get...

886
00:59:31,348 --> 00:59:33,248
No. No, I'm wrong.

887
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:36,476
God didn't forsake it.
He never considered it in the first place.

888
00:59:36,653 --> 00:59:40,145
Look what it's meant to you:
Explosions and killings and murders.

889
00:59:40,323 --> 00:59:42,985
Boy, this is a real wonderful place
to raise a family.

890
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:46,185
And look at that street out there.
There's a real charmer for you.

891
00:59:46,363 --> 00:59:49,264
One saloon after the other,
and everything that goes with it.

892
00:59:49,432 --> 00:59:52,196
That isn't the point.
The point is I wanted to be with you.

893
00:59:52,369 --> 00:59:54,929
The bureau has got no right
to send anybody down here...

894
00:59:55,105 --> 00:59:58,506
...with no churches and no schools
and no decent food and no good doctors.

895
00:59:58,675 --> 01:00:01,803
- No wonder this thing happened to you.
- That isn't why it happened.

896
01:00:01,978 --> 01:00:05,004
How do you know, when anything
can happen in a hellhole like this?

897
01:00:05,181 --> 01:00:06,978
And, boy, that's what it is,
a hellhole.

898
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:09,880
Nothing but a lot of red clay
and Gila monsters.

899
01:00:10,053 --> 01:00:12,248
Honey, let me ask you something.

900
01:00:12,422 --> 01:00:14,253
Did you ever see a robin around here?

901
01:00:14,424 --> 01:00:16,858
Little robin redbreast?
A little bird?

902
01:00:17,027 --> 01:00:18,927
Ever see one?
No, of course you never did.

903
01:00:19,095 --> 01:00:21,620
Because a robin's got too much sense
to come down here.

904
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:24,596
And if one ever did come down here,
he'd keep right on going.

905
01:00:24,768 --> 01:00:27,134
Well, I'm just as good as any robin.

906
01:00:27,304 --> 01:00:30,705
And I'm getting out. I may have
to dig ditches, but I'm getting out.

907
01:00:30,874 --> 01:00:33,638
Now, Chip, you sit down here.

908
01:00:34,344 --> 01:00:36,141
Sit down.

909
01:00:39,316 --> 01:00:40,840
I'm...

910
01:00:41,017 --> 01:00:42,314
I'm sorry, honey.

911
01:00:42,485 --> 01:00:44,612
I know how you feel.

912
01:00:44,788 --> 01:00:49,555
You're tired and you're upset,
but that's no reason to be foolish.

913
01:00:49,726 --> 01:00:52,820
The bureau had nothing to do
with what happened tonight.

914
01:00:52,996 --> 01:00:55,794
And you're not going to quit.

915
01:00:56,099 --> 01:00:58,624
I didn't marry a robin or a ditch digger...

916
01:00:58,802 --> 01:01:00,463
...I married you.

917
01:01:00,637 --> 01:01:02,502
And you're going to stay
in the bureau...

918
01:01:02,672 --> 01:01:05,664
...because, good or bad,
that's where you belong.

919
01:01:09,012 --> 01:01:10,877
Besides...

920
01:01:11,047 --> 01:01:14,107
...there are times
when I'm even proud of you.

921
01:01:18,488 --> 01:01:20,353
Lucy.

922
01:01:21,324 --> 01:01:22,848
Lucy.

923
01:01:23,893 --> 01:01:26,919
For the next few years,
we were in the Midwest.

924
01:01:27,097 --> 01:01:28,860
And there was one piece of good news:

925
01:01:29,032 --> 01:01:31,159
I was working again with Sam Crandall.

926
01:01:31,334 --> 01:01:33,859
The rest of the news wasn't so good.

927
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:40,233
In Kansas City...

928
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:42,810
...Frank Nash,
convicted for mail robbery...

929
01:01:42,979 --> 01:01:46,540
...was being transported
to Leavenworth Penitentiary.

930
01:01:46,716 --> 01:01:51,847
He was in the custody of local officers
and special agents of the FBI.

931
01:02:05,435 --> 01:02:07,369
Oh, my God, don't. Don't shoot me!

932
01:02:18,615 --> 01:02:21,709
The ringleader of the massacre
was Pretty Boy Floyd.

933
01:02:21,885 --> 01:02:25,252
One of the man killed
was Special Agent Raymond Caffery.

934
01:02:25,422 --> 01:02:30,018
By federal law, he was not authorized
to carry firearms.

935
01:02:31,261 --> 01:02:33,661
The killings continued.

936
01:02:33,997 --> 01:02:36,761
The FBI was still unarmed.

937
01:02:40,703 --> 01:02:44,764
Gangsters like Baby Face Nelson
knew the bureau could not retaliate...

938
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:47,205
...and they made the most of it.

939
01:02:49,412 --> 01:02:52,745
Civic groups appealed
to Washington for help.

940
01:02:55,285 --> 01:02:59,346
J. Edgar Hoover asked for authority
to arm FBI men.

941
01:02:59,522 --> 01:03:01,956
Newspapers supported the move...

942
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:04,753
...but it wasn't easy to get action.

943
01:03:14,971 --> 01:03:16,233
It's very simple, dear.

944
01:03:16,406 --> 01:03:19,569
Fix the one that doesn't work,
then all the others light up.

945
01:03:19,742 --> 01:03:20,766
I know.

946
01:03:21,077 --> 01:03:23,841
Except the one that doesn't work
is always around back here.

947
01:03:24,013 --> 01:03:27,505
It's never out front. Never out front.
It's always around back here.

948
01:03:30,854 --> 01:03:32,446
There.

949
01:03:32,655 --> 01:03:34,452
There it is.

950
01:03:35,158 --> 01:03:36,420
There.

951
01:03:39,996 --> 01:03:41,554
Pretty good.

952
01:03:42,265 --> 01:03:44,358
Pretty good. Good, good.

953
01:04:01,117 --> 01:04:03,085
- Lucy!
- Yes?

954
01:04:03,653 --> 01:04:06,679
I had some tissue paper.
I put it right up here a couple days ago.

955
01:04:06,856 --> 01:04:09,552
- Oh, it's not there.
- Well, I know it's not there.

956
01:04:09,726 --> 01:04:13,856
That's the reason I brought the subject up.
I bought tissue paper, put it on the shelf.

957
01:04:14,063 --> 01:04:15,360
Jennie took it.

958
01:04:15,532 --> 01:04:17,124
Oh, she did?

959
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:18,858
Well... Jennie!

960
01:04:19,035 --> 01:04:21,162
She can give it back.
That's my tissue paper.

961
01:04:21,337 --> 01:04:24,568
She can give it right back, right now.
That's my tissue paper.

962
01:04:25,308 --> 01:04:27,799
- Hello, Daddy.
- How do you do?

963
01:04:28,378 --> 01:04:30,778
Well, hey... Hey, come...

964
01:04:30,947 --> 01:04:33,381
I'm going out and play now.

965
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:36,485
- What's that?
- She's an angel in the Christmas play.

966
01:04:36,653 --> 01:04:38,985
We didn't have wings,
so we used the tissue paper.

967
01:04:39,155 --> 01:04:41,180
- Did you use all of it?
- Well, practically.

968
01:04:41,357 --> 01:04:43,348
We couldn't send her out
with only one wing.

969
01:04:43,526 --> 01:04:45,289
Used up all my tissue paper.

970
01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:47,929
I don't know, I don't think
it's a very good example...

971
01:04:48,097 --> 01:04:50,998
How do you think the audience would
feel if I'd get up and say:

972
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:54,568
"See that little angel right on the right
there? She steals tissue paper."

973
01:04:54,737 --> 01:04:57,205
Doesn't seem very impressive to me.

974
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:02,105
Hi, Dad.

975
01:05:02,478 --> 01:05:04,105
Hold it.

976
01:05:04,347 --> 01:05:06,907
Hold it just a second.
What are you doing in that getup?

977
01:05:07,083 --> 01:05:09,415
I'll bet you stole a pair of my socks.

978
01:05:09,819 --> 01:05:11,047
He's playing Joseph.

979
01:05:11,221 --> 01:05:14,088
And nobody needs your old socks.
Joseph wore sandals.

980
01:05:14,257 --> 01:05:15,622
Now, go play with your sister.

981
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:19,926
I'm surprised you didn't take
a pair of my shoes and cut them down.

982
01:05:20,096 --> 01:05:21,154
Oh, Chip.

983
01:05:21,331 --> 01:05:24,232
Well, here,
you might as well open this now.

984
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,595
It's your Christmas present.

985
01:05:27,337 --> 01:05:29,328
That's the reason
I wanted the tissue paper.

986
01:05:29,505 --> 01:05:31,769
So I could wrap up the present
and put bows on it.

987
01:05:31,941 --> 01:05:34,341
That's what tissue paper's for.

988
01:05:37,113 --> 01:05:39,104
Oh, now, Chip.

989
01:05:39,282 --> 01:05:42,718
- Is tissue paper really that important?
- Not in this house.

990
01:05:42,885 --> 01:05:44,512
Just wrap it up in any old thing.

991
01:05:44,687 --> 01:05:46,655
Any old comic strip.

992
01:05:46,823 --> 01:05:49,758
Would you like it if I wrapped it
in the "Katzenjammer Kids"...

993
01:05:49,926 --> 01:05:52,394
...and said "Merry Christmas"?
- Well, let me ask you.

994
01:05:52,562 --> 01:05:55,030
If I wrapped yours in "Major Hoople,"
would you care?

995
01:05:55,198 --> 01:05:58,224
- Or would you like it anyway?
- That's an entirely different thing.

996
01:05:58,401 --> 01:06:00,301
Oh, it is not.

997
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:02,370
Anything you've ever given me...

998
01:06:02,538 --> 01:06:04,631
...I've never cared how it was wrapped.

999
01:06:04,807 --> 01:06:07,241
As long as you give it to me.

1000
01:06:11,614 --> 01:06:14,447
- How many angels are there?
- Two.

1001
01:06:14,617 --> 01:06:17,211
But Jennie was the first one chosen.

1002
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:24,817
- The doorbell's ringing, dear.
- Well, go ahead and answer it.

1003
01:06:24,994 --> 01:06:26,655
You answer it.

1004
01:06:31,634 --> 01:06:32,828
Merry Christmas.

1005
01:06:33,002 --> 01:06:35,129
George, how are you?
Here, I'll take your coat.

1006
01:06:35,305 --> 01:06:36,829
Thank you. Merry Christmas, Lucy.

1007
01:06:37,006 --> 01:06:39,406
- Merry Christmas, Sam.
- Some presents, Mrs. Hardesty.

1008
01:06:39,575 --> 01:06:40,974
Thank you, George.

1009
01:06:41,144 --> 01:06:44,443
- Where's Mike?
- Oh, he's out on the back porch.

1010
01:06:45,848 --> 01:06:49,181
Hold it.
Always bring my own mistletoe.

1011
01:06:49,686 --> 01:06:52,120
- I'll get the eggnog.
- Good.

1012
01:06:55,858 --> 01:06:58,088
House looks nice, Lucy.

1013
01:06:58,695 --> 01:07:00,595
Woman's touch.

1014
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,090
Why didn't you ever remarry, Sam?

1015
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:08,865
I don't know.

1016
01:07:09,605 --> 01:07:12,836
Maybe... Maybe the first time
was too good.

1017
01:07:13,109 --> 01:07:14,906
- Yes.
- Here we are.

1018
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:17,336
Three loving cups.

1019
01:07:18,381 --> 01:07:20,872
Holy smoke, I almost forgot.

1020
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:22,779
Look here, Chip. Look.

1021
01:07:22,952 --> 01:07:25,079
- It's out of committee.
- What is?

1022
01:07:25,254 --> 01:07:28,519
Hey, the Wayburne Bill.
That means it'll come up for a vote.

1023
01:07:28,691 --> 01:07:31,091
We're gonna get authority
to carry firearms.

1024
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,285
Hey, this is a real Christmas present.

1025
01:07:33,696 --> 01:07:35,288
I don't think it is.

1026
01:07:35,465 --> 01:07:38,730
That means you'll go looking
for a hoodlum with a gun in your pocket.

1027
01:07:38,901 --> 01:07:40,766
You bet your life.
And he'll know it too.

1028
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:42,398
That's right.

1029
01:07:42,572 --> 01:07:45,370
That leaves him only one alternative.
He'll have to kill you.

1030
01:07:45,541 --> 01:07:47,532
Oh, now, take it easy, honey.

1031
01:07:47,944 --> 01:07:49,536
You take it easy, Chip.

1032
01:07:49,712 --> 01:07:52,180
I don't look good in black.

1033
01:08:17,673 --> 01:08:19,402
Let me repeat again:

1034
01:08:19,575 --> 01:08:21,509
Get to know this weapon.

1035
01:08:21,677 --> 01:08:24,703
Craftiness can solve
many a criminal case...

1036
01:08:24,881 --> 01:08:26,143
...but with hoodlums...

1037
01:08:26,315 --> 01:08:30,843
...you sometimes need a good,
conscientious, hardworking machine gun.

1038
01:08:31,087 --> 01:08:32,611
Crandall.

1039
01:08:33,956 --> 01:08:36,789
Bolt back, safety on.

1040
01:08:37,026 --> 01:08:38,891
Insert the clip.

1041
01:08:40,763 --> 01:08:42,355
Commence firing.

1042
01:08:47,770 --> 01:08:49,328
On the night of April 22nd...

1043
01:08:49,505 --> 01:08:53,839
...special agents of the FBI
converged on Spider Lake, Wisconsin.

1044
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:58,037
A group of hoodlums was holed up
in a nearby resort hotel.

1045
01:08:58,214 --> 01:09:01,877
But barking dogs alerted them,
and some of them escaped.

1046
01:09:02,051 --> 01:09:06,420
Sam and I rode down to a country store
to call the Chicago office.

1047
01:09:06,889 --> 01:09:11,019
We were worried because the fugitives
were armed and dangerous.

1048
01:09:11,427 --> 01:09:13,486
One of them was Baby Face Nelson.

1049
01:09:14,864 --> 01:09:16,525
No mind them potato bugs.

1050
01:09:16,699 --> 01:09:19,361
They're just trying to get comfortable.

1051
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:22,738
Oh, excuse me.

1052
01:09:25,441 --> 01:09:28,342
Schneider's Resort and Grocery Store.

1053
01:09:29,779 --> 01:09:31,679
You don't say.

1054
01:09:31,848 --> 01:09:34,408
Well, beat a rug.

1055
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:36,208
Yeah?

1056
01:09:36,385 --> 01:09:37,909
Yeah.

1057
01:09:38,754 --> 01:09:42,281
It's the missus. She says things are popping
up at the roadhouse.

1058
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:44,824
Guns shooting, dogs barking.

1059
01:09:44,994 --> 01:09:46,723
It's hell on a Ferris wheel.

1060
01:09:48,331 --> 01:09:49,889
Whose car is that out front?

1061
01:09:52,735 --> 01:09:55,636
Are you one of them fellas
that was doing the shooting?

1062
01:09:55,805 --> 01:09:58,273
Oh, now, that's a silly question, Cliff.

1063
01:09:58,441 --> 01:10:01,342
- Whose car?
- Mine.

1064
01:10:01,744 --> 01:10:03,211
You can have the keys.

1065
01:10:03,946 --> 01:10:06,346
We'll all go. I need protection.

1066
01:10:06,516 --> 01:10:07,540
Come on.

1067
01:10:09,852 --> 01:10:12,218
You too, Uncle Fudd.

1068
01:10:16,993 --> 01:10:18,358
In the car.

1069
01:10:34,477 --> 01:10:37,878
We'd better put in a call to the office,
don't you think?

1070
01:10:47,356 --> 01:10:49,620
We're FBI. Who are you?

1071
01:10:54,096 --> 01:10:55,893
All right, come on, get out of the car.

1072
01:11:14,483 --> 01:11:15,814
You all right, Chip?

1073
01:11:19,021 --> 01:11:21,455
He just creased me.
I'm all right.

1074
01:11:21,624 --> 01:11:23,285
That's good.

1075
01:11:24,126 --> 01:11:29,029
Because I don't think I am.

1076
01:11:30,032 --> 01:11:31,556
Get a doctor.

1077
01:11:31,734 --> 01:11:34,032
- Here, help me carry him inside.
- No.

1078
01:11:34,203 --> 01:11:36,171
No, no, please.

1079
01:11:36,505 --> 01:11:38,769
I'd rather stay out here.

1080
01:11:41,444 --> 01:11:44,311
What's...? What's that, lilacs?

1081
01:11:44,847 --> 01:11:46,246
No.

1082
01:11:46,415 --> 01:11:47,712
No, it couldn't be.

1083
01:11:47,883 --> 01:11:49,680
It'd be two weeks early.

1084
01:11:50,419 --> 01:11:53,320
Guess l... Guess I always wanna
rush the lilacs.

1085
01:11:53,489 --> 01:11:56,754
Now, just take it easy, Sam.
Now, try and lie quiet.

1086
01:11:59,962 --> 01:12:03,193
You know...?
You know something silly, Chip?

1087
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:07,599
- I think that fella's killed me.
- No, no, no. No, please.

1088
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:10,500
- And it... It's a shame.
- Please.

1089
01:12:11,841 --> 01:12:14,036
It's a shame for young George.

1090
01:12:15,211 --> 01:12:18,442
First his mother and then this.

1091
01:12:19,015 --> 01:12:20,710
He's... He's gonna...

1092
01:12:20,883 --> 01:12:23,044
Gonna figure
it's kind of rude of us, Chip.

1093
01:12:23,219 --> 01:12:25,653
No. No, he won't, Sam.

1094
01:12:25,821 --> 01:12:27,448
He won't.

1095
01:12:27,623 --> 01:12:29,113
Tell him...

1096
01:12:29,592 --> 01:12:31,059
Tell him I love him...

1097
01:12:31,227 --> 01:12:35,857
...and that I didn't count on
being this rude.

1098
01:12:36,232 --> 01:12:38,029
Sam.

1099
01:13:36,325 --> 01:13:39,817
"The days of our years
are threescore years and 10.

1100
01:13:39,995 --> 01:13:43,829
And if by reason of strength
they be fourscore years...

1101
01:13:43,999 --> 01:13:47,127
...yet is there strength,
labor and sorrow.

1102
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:49,461
So teach us to number our days...

1103
01:13:49,638 --> 01:13:53,802
...that we may apply our hearts
from the wisdom."

1104
01:13:56,512 --> 01:13:58,878
I can say very little
about the deceased.

1105
01:13:59,048 --> 01:14:01,039
I barely knew him.

1106
01:14:01,283 --> 01:14:04,081
He attended church
and was a good father...

1107
01:14:04,253 --> 01:14:08,986
...and he died, I'm told,
because he opposed evil.

1108
01:14:09,759 --> 01:14:12,694
Those are the skimpy facts of his life.

1109
01:14:13,028 --> 01:14:17,431
However, I imagine they are sufficient
to recommend him to our Lord.

1110
01:14:19,301 --> 01:14:21,269
On the way here,
I heard a woman mention...

1111
01:14:21,437 --> 01:14:24,406
...that it was not a very nice day
for a funeral.

1112
01:14:24,573 --> 01:14:26,438
That is not so.

1113
01:14:27,209 --> 01:14:31,669
I would remind you that any day
a good man goes to God...

1114
01:14:31,847 --> 01:14:33,974
...is a very nice day for a funeral.

1115
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:59,264
Edith.

1116
01:15:01,076 --> 01:15:04,375
Edith, you've been
a wonderful sister to Sam.

1117
01:15:04,547 --> 01:15:07,710
But is there any way
we could help you with George?

1118
01:15:07,883 --> 01:15:10,875
I mean, we could keep him
over at our house for a while.

1119
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,711
No, it'll be all right.

1120
01:15:13,989 --> 01:15:16,321
George doesn't need a man
in the house.

1121
01:15:16,492 --> 01:15:18,255
He is one.

1122
01:15:18,427 --> 01:15:19,655
Thank you.

1123
01:15:23,899 --> 01:15:26,527
I can't believe he's gone.

1124
01:15:26,802 --> 01:15:30,898
You know,
I never once told Sam I liked him.

1125
01:15:31,674 --> 01:15:33,539
Didn't even have a chance
to say goodbye.

1126
01:15:33,709 --> 01:15:36,542
He kept talking about lilacs...

1127
01:15:36,946 --> 01:15:38,777
...and then he died.

1128
01:15:38,948 --> 01:15:41,940
Just as if that was all
there was to say.

1129
01:15:46,989 --> 01:15:48,217
After Sam's death...

1130
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:51,621
...the FBI intensified its war
on the underworld.

1131
01:15:51,794 --> 01:15:55,855
The director sent
Special Agent Sam Cowley to Chicago.

1132
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:59,194
Instructions were
to search out any and all gangsters.

1133
01:15:59,368 --> 01:16:01,859
To capture them dead or alive.

1134
01:16:02,404 --> 01:16:05,532
One of the gangsters was John Dillinger.

1135
01:16:05,708 --> 01:16:08,734
He had a girlfriend named Anna Sage.

1136
01:16:08,911 --> 01:16:10,811
Immigration officials
were taking steps...

1137
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:14,245
...to have her deported
as an undesirable alien.

1138
01:16:14,416 --> 01:16:17,579
The charge: Moral turpitude.

1139
01:16:18,654 --> 01:16:22,055
Well, can't you just tell these people
plain flat not to send me back?

1140
01:16:22,524 --> 01:16:24,082
We can't do that, Miss Sage.

1141
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:27,229
- We will say you were cooperative.
- That wouldn't be no lie.

1142
01:16:27,396 --> 01:16:29,728
- I've been cooperative all my life.
- We understand.

1143
01:16:29,899 --> 01:16:33,096
That's how I come to get in this fix,
being cooperative all the time.

1144
01:16:33,469 --> 01:16:36,302
About tonight,
you're sure he's going to the movies?

1145
01:16:36,839 --> 01:16:38,864
With me and this girlfriend of mine.

1146
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:40,941
Only, she's more like an associate.

1147
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:42,737
And you don't know which movie?

1148
01:16:42,912 --> 01:16:45,176
I'll call and tell you which one.

1149
01:16:45,848 --> 01:16:48,442
- Now, I won't do this unless...
- You'll get the money.

1150
01:16:49,084 --> 01:16:53,020
And you promise me you'll talk to these
people about not sending me away?

1151
01:16:55,291 --> 01:16:58,692
Because I wouldn't turn him in
except for having a good reason.

1152
01:16:59,128 --> 01:17:01,688
He's more than just a regular
business friend, you know.

1153
01:17:01,864 --> 01:17:03,422
We know.

1154
01:17:03,599 --> 01:17:05,499
Now, you'll be at the theater with him...

1155
01:17:05,668 --> 01:17:08,068
...and so our men will recognize you...

1156
01:17:08,237 --> 01:17:09,704
...do you have a red dress?

1157
01:17:10,539 --> 01:17:12,666
- Well, sure.
- Wear it.

1158
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:15,901
- Okay.
- That's all, Miss Sage.

1159
01:17:16,979 --> 01:17:18,844
Thank you, sir.

1160
01:19:30,546 --> 01:19:32,013
Hello?

1161
01:19:32,181 --> 01:19:34,149
- Lucy.
- Oh, Chip.

1162
01:19:34,316 --> 01:19:36,375
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1163
01:19:36,552 --> 01:19:38,315
- You're sure?
- Sure.

1164
01:19:38,487 --> 01:19:40,682
- See you later, sweetheart.
- Yes.

1165
01:19:53,001 --> 01:19:55,595
I guess Lucy had reason to worry.

1166
01:19:55,771 --> 01:19:59,639
Because Sam Crandall
wasn't the only agent who was killed.

1167
01:19:59,808 --> 01:20:02,743
Special Agent Herman Hollis
and Inspector Sam Cowley...

1168
01:20:02,911 --> 01:20:05,209
...died almost immediately.

1169
01:20:08,784 --> 01:20:12,185
But not before they killed
Baby Face Nelson.

1170
01:20:29,771 --> 01:20:31,762
The war went on.

1171
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:35,740
On October 22nd,
we found Pretty Boy Floyd.

1172
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:39,647
Get in there!

1173
01:20:40,516 --> 01:20:42,814
- You drive, mister.
- Yes, sir.

1174
01:20:42,985 --> 01:20:44,418
Hurry up.

1175
01:21:45,681 --> 01:21:47,945
Hey, what are you doing up this hour?

1176
01:21:48,116 --> 01:21:49,981
I couldn't sleep.

1177
01:21:50,152 --> 01:21:52,177
Oh, honey, look what I got for Jennie.

1178
01:21:52,354 --> 01:21:55,323
We were on stakeout,
and there was this little store.

1179
01:21:55,490 --> 01:21:57,117
Here, now...

1180
01:21:57,359 --> 01:22:00,351
See? Now, it's got this propeller.

1181
01:22:01,163 --> 01:22:03,427
And when the wind hits it,
it plays a tune.

1182
01:22:04,099 --> 01:22:06,226
Then you put it on like that.

1183
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:08,231
Recognize that?
That's "Yankee Doodle."

1184
01:22:08,403 --> 01:22:10,894
Of course, it's not like you'd
play it on the piano.

1185
01:22:11,073 --> 01:22:12,665
It's very nice.

1186
01:22:12,841 --> 01:22:14,809
- Do you want some coffee?
- Yeah.

1187
01:22:14,977 --> 01:22:17,207
Yeah, I could use some coffee.

1188
01:22:19,181 --> 01:22:20,705
What's this?

1189
01:22:20,882 --> 01:22:22,509
What's all this stuff here?

1190
01:22:22,684 --> 01:22:25,118
It's packing. I'm going to visit the folks.

1191
01:22:26,421 --> 01:22:28,480
I suppose that means
the kids are going too.

1192
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:32,316
Well, since I don't wear BVDs,
I guess it does.

1193
01:22:36,999 --> 01:22:39,797
Well, I think it's nice
that you gave me a warning.

1194
01:22:39,968 --> 01:22:41,196
You're welcome.

1195
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:43,361
So in case somebody asks me
where you are...

1196
01:22:43,538 --> 01:22:46,439
...I won't have to tell them
I've misplaced all of you.

1197
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:53,409
Well, how long
are you gonna be gone?

1198
01:22:53,682 --> 01:22:55,013
That's up to you.

1199
01:22:55,183 --> 01:22:56,411
It's up to me.

1200
01:22:56,585 --> 01:22:58,883
Well, I don't get it. I don't understand.

1201
01:23:00,322 --> 01:23:01,880
That's just the trouble, Chip.

1202
01:23:02,057 --> 01:23:04,321
I don't think you ever will.

1203
01:23:04,493 --> 01:23:06,518
I can't go on like this any longer.

1204
01:23:06,695 --> 01:23:09,323
Day after day, night after night.

1205
01:23:09,498 --> 01:23:10,726
Look at that calendar.

1206
01:23:10,899 --> 01:23:12,799
I've marked all the different times.

1207
01:23:12,968 --> 01:23:15,095
In three months,
I don't know how many times...

1208
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:17,397
...on stakeouts and gunfights.

1209
01:23:17,572 --> 01:23:20,439
I can't answer the phone
or listen to the radio.

1210
01:23:20,609 --> 01:23:22,839
I can't even look up
tomorrow's weather report.

1211
01:23:23,011 --> 01:23:26,208
- I'm afraid I'll read you're dead.
- Oh, now, honey, it's not that bad.

1212
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:28,008
It is for me.

1213
01:23:28,183 --> 01:23:31,414
Well, Lucy, l...
This is my job.

1214
01:23:31,586 --> 01:23:33,315
There are other jobs.

1215
01:23:33,488 --> 01:23:35,183
You want me to leave the bureau?

1216
01:23:35,357 --> 01:23:37,484
I thought that was settled
a long time ago.

1217
01:23:37,659 --> 01:23:40,150
That was before all the shooting.
It's different now.

1218
01:23:40,329 --> 01:23:43,696
Well, what good will it do for you
to run away like this?

1219
01:23:43,865 --> 01:23:45,560
I don't know.

1220
01:23:46,201 --> 01:23:47,896
Maybe you won't miss me.

1221
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:50,436
But I'm counting on you
to miss the children.

1222
01:23:50,605 --> 01:23:52,470
You're counting on me to quit, huh?

1223
01:23:52,641 --> 01:23:56,202
- I can't quit, and I'll tell you why.
- Please don't explain. I already know.

1224
01:23:56,378 --> 01:23:58,676
- In two words: Sam Crandall.
- No, no, no.

1225
01:23:58,847 --> 01:24:00,178
There's where you're wrong.

1226
01:24:01,049 --> 01:24:04,416
That's where you're wrong.
The two words are Chip Hardesty.

1227
01:24:04,586 --> 01:24:06,747
All they did to Sam
was kill him on the outside.

1228
01:24:06,922 --> 01:24:09,857
Well, if I quit now,
I'll be deader than Sam.

1229
01:24:10,025 --> 01:24:11,959
I'll be dead inside.

1230
01:24:13,562 --> 01:24:16,087
That doesn't give me much choice,
does it?

1231
01:24:16,264 --> 01:24:19,358
I get to choose
which way I want you dead.

1232
01:24:20,435 --> 01:24:23,962
Lucy, honey,
you can't do a thing like this.

1233
01:24:25,607 --> 01:24:29,703
No, you... You can't just walk off
and say goodbye.

1234
01:24:30,145 --> 01:24:32,943
I'm not going to say goodbye, Chip.

1235
01:24:33,482 --> 01:24:35,916
I love you too much.

1236
01:24:36,385 --> 01:24:39,354
I'm just going to order a cab...

1237
01:24:39,688 --> 01:24:42,748
...and when it comes,
I'm going to leave in it.

1238
01:25:42,818 --> 01:25:44,251
Do you need any more eggs?

1239
01:25:44,419 --> 01:25:47,684
Oh, no. We'll just hide enough
so they get the spirit of the thing.

1240
01:25:47,856 --> 01:25:49,983
Too bad Chip couldn't be here.

1241
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:51,386
Please, Mother.

1242
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:54,120
Well, I just mentioned it.
After all, it is Easter.

1243
01:25:54,296 --> 01:25:55,786
You just mention it every day...

1244
01:25:55,964 --> 01:25:58,023
...whether it happens
to be Easter or not.

1245
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,930
That's not the point.
I think Chip needs you.

1246
01:26:01,102 --> 01:26:02,660
And you need Chip.

1247
01:26:03,805 --> 01:26:06,638
You know, I never realized
what Dad had to put up with.

1248
01:26:06,808 --> 01:26:09,402
You're a nag. A real nag.

1249
01:26:09,578 --> 01:26:11,978
All right, children,
you can come out now.

1250
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:16,884
They're all hidden. Go ahead.

1251
01:26:19,588 --> 01:26:22,648
- I got one.
- Hey, I got one too.

1252
01:26:33,735 --> 01:26:36,670
- I found another one.
- Me too.

1253
01:26:36,838 --> 01:26:39,466
Oh, gee, this is a pretty one.

1254
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:47,008
Did you hear?

1255
01:26:47,182 --> 01:26:50,151
FBI nabbed another one of them
big criminals.

1256
01:26:50,318 --> 01:26:52,650
Fact is,
they mentioned it in Congress.

1257
01:26:52,821 --> 01:26:54,152
Whole rigmarole.

1258
01:26:54,322 --> 01:26:56,051
Speaker of the House himself.

1259
01:26:56,224 --> 01:26:57,691
That's very interesting.

1260
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:02,323
Funny thing, only the other day
I was reading a piece about the FBI...

1261
01:27:02,497 --> 01:27:04,089
...and how much good they're doing.

1262
01:27:04,266 --> 01:27:06,257
Right here in the Kansas City Star.

1263
01:27:06,434 --> 01:27:10,734
You just happened to be reading
an article in the Kansas City Star.

1264
01:27:10,906 --> 01:27:14,273
Now, honestly, Dad, don't you think
this is getting to be a little silly?

1265
01:27:14,442 --> 01:27:17,434
Digging through the library
for articles about the FBI.

1266
01:27:17,612 --> 01:27:19,239
It's disgusting.

1267
01:27:19,414 --> 01:27:20,972
Haven't you heard about your dad?

1268
01:27:21,149 --> 01:27:22,446
He's a nag.

1269
01:27:22,617 --> 01:27:24,414
Oh, that's very clever, Mother.

1270
01:27:24,586 --> 01:27:30,456
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- Four, five, six, seven.

1271
01:27:31,226 --> 01:27:34,627
- Seven, eight, nine.
- Seven, eight, nine.

1272
01:27:34,796 --> 01:27:38,095
I don't have any eggs.
I don't have any.

1273
01:27:40,936 --> 01:27:42,631
You don't do it right, Mom.

1274
01:27:42,804 --> 01:27:45,136
Dad always used to hide a few
out in plain sight...

1275
01:27:45,307 --> 01:27:46,638
...so Jennie could find them.

1276
01:27:49,277 --> 01:27:51,006
Oh, Lord.

1277
01:27:51,279 --> 01:27:53,509
What kind of a person am I?

1278
01:27:53,682 --> 01:27:56,651
I can't even hide Easter eggs
without Chip.

1279
01:28:07,262 --> 01:28:08,695
Daddy! Daddy!

1280
01:28:08,863 --> 01:28:12,594
- Hey! Hey, how are you?
- Hello, Daddy. Daddy...

1281
01:28:13,168 --> 01:28:16,899
- Welcome home, Daddy.
- Gee, I'm glad to see you. How are you, son?

1282
01:28:17,072 --> 01:28:19,165
Children, would you run
and get the suitcases?

1283
01:28:19,341 --> 01:28:21,172
- Sure, Mother.
- All right.

1284
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,079
The kids look fine, Lucy.

1285
01:28:27,248 --> 01:28:28,510
So do you.

1286
01:28:28,683 --> 01:28:31,277
I'm so excited,
I have no idea how you look.

1287
01:28:34,689 --> 01:28:37,886
Well, you must be
a pretty good housekeeper.

1288
01:28:38,059 --> 01:28:39,856
The place looks very neat.

1289
01:28:40,028 --> 01:28:41,689
And flowers.

1290
01:28:42,130 --> 01:28:43,995
Oh, I managed all right, I guess.

1291
01:28:44,899 --> 01:28:46,457
You didn't write too often.

1292
01:28:46,935 --> 01:28:48,425
Well, I've been pretty busy.

1293
01:28:55,377 --> 01:28:59,040
- What's the matter?
- Not even a dirty dish.

1294
01:28:59,714 --> 01:29:02,205
I suppose
I'm a little disappointed, Chip.

1295
01:29:02,384 --> 01:29:04,045
I judged by myself.

1296
01:29:04,219 --> 01:29:07,382
I expected you to miss me
just a little bit more than you did.

1297
01:29:07,555 --> 01:29:10,023
Oh, well, you know,
the dishes. I just...

1298
01:29:10,392 --> 01:29:12,860
That's all right.
I'm happy to be home.

1299
01:29:13,028 --> 01:29:15,292
I'll help the kids with the bags.

1300
01:29:15,463 --> 01:29:16,691
Oh, what's this?

1301
01:29:16,865 --> 01:29:19,231
Oh, that's a letter I wrote.
I forgot to mail it.

1302
01:29:19,401 --> 01:29:20,766
- What's it say?
- Don't open it.

1303
01:29:20,935 --> 01:29:24,735
- It's against the law to open the mail.
- It's addressed to me.

1304
01:29:27,409 --> 01:29:28,637
"My dearest Lucy...

1305
01:29:28,810 --> 01:29:33,179
...I don't know if I can stand another week
or another day of this.

1306
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:37,574
I go from room to room,
and the funny thing, Lucy...

1307
01:29:37,752 --> 01:29:40,050
...is they're not empty rooms.

1308
01:29:40,221 --> 01:29:43,349
If someone's never been in a room,
it's empty.

1309
01:29:43,792 --> 01:29:48,058
But if someone's lived there,
it seems crowded with that person.

1310
01:29:48,596 --> 01:29:50,154
Lucy, I need you.

1311
01:29:50,331 --> 01:29:52,663
I'll die without you.

1312
01:29:54,002 --> 01:29:56,027
All my love, Chip."

1313
01:29:57,372 --> 01:29:58,771
Lucy.

1314
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:00,601
Lucy.

1315
01:30:00,975 --> 01:30:03,466
Oh, Lucy.

1316
01:30:04,746 --> 01:30:06,941
You shouldn't believe
everything in that letter.

1317
01:30:07,115 --> 01:30:09,811
I didn't know what I was saying.
A lot of it's a misprint.

1318
01:30:09,984 --> 01:30:12,179
It's wonderful to be home.

1319
01:30:12,353 --> 01:30:16,380
- Mom, Dad, what kind of truck is that?
- Daddy, there's a big truck outside.

1320
01:30:24,733 --> 01:30:26,223
What's this?

1321
01:30:26,534 --> 01:30:30,834
Well, I'm afraid
you're not gonna be home very long.

1322
01:30:31,005 --> 01:30:34,964
I haven't had a chance to tell you,
but we've been transferred to Washington.

1323
01:30:35,143 --> 01:30:37,111
Oh, no, don't tell me.

1324
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:40,771
Maybe you better stand up, honey.

1325
01:30:40,949 --> 01:30:45,613
You know, these big trucks,
I think they put the sofa in first.

1326
01:30:51,159 --> 01:30:52,490
I spent the next few years...

1327
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:55,823
...operating out of the new headquarters
in Washington.

1328
01:30:56,564 --> 01:30:59,692
Lucy said it looked like
a very nice place.

1329
01:30:59,868 --> 01:31:04,396
But some of the offices
didn't seem too cozy.

1330
01:31:05,206 --> 01:31:08,698
In this little room, 16 million pieces
of correspondence...

1331
01:31:08,877 --> 01:31:11,641
...were processed every six months.

1332
01:31:14,149 --> 01:31:17,016
The crime laboratory
was the largest in the world...

1333
01:31:17,185 --> 01:31:19,676
...equipped to handle any kind of a case.

1334
01:31:19,854 --> 01:31:21,947
In the paint section, for instance...

1335
01:31:22,123 --> 01:31:25,286
...a hit-and-run case in South Carolina
was solved.

1336
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:28,657
A sample of chipped paint
was found on the victim's clothing.

1337
01:31:28,830 --> 01:31:33,767
It was burned in the spectrograph.
The manufacturer was identified.

1338
01:31:34,068 --> 01:31:35,660
In the automotive-paint section...

1339
01:31:35,837 --> 01:31:38,965
...it was matched up for
make and model of the car.

1340
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:41,506
The owner was easily traced.

1341
01:31:42,177 --> 01:31:46,238
In one section alone, they had hundreds
of samples of human hair...

1342
01:31:46,414 --> 01:31:50,612
...and samples of hair from every
known animal, even a wombat.

1343
01:31:50,785 --> 01:31:53,447
Lucy said the FBI would be
a very valuable organization...

1344
01:31:53,621 --> 01:31:58,058
...if we ever had a suspect
who happened to be a wombat.

1345
01:31:58,426 --> 01:32:00,553
We did have one who was a reindeer.

1346
01:32:02,430 --> 01:32:05,593
A trapper from Alaska
was indicted for murder.

1347
01:32:05,767 --> 01:32:08,793
The strongest evidence against him
was blood on his clothing.

1348
01:32:08,970 --> 01:32:12,064
Our chemist broke down a sample
and found it was from a reindeer...

1349
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:14,140
...and the man was freed.

1350
01:32:14,809 --> 01:32:17,573
I worked on a number
of assignments.

1351
01:32:17,745 --> 01:32:20,578
I was in the fugitive section
for a couple of years.

1352
01:32:20,748 --> 01:32:23,342
And during that time, the last
of the mid-'30 hoodlums...

1353
01:32:23,518 --> 01:32:25,645
...were accounted for.

1354
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:31,383
One of them was a shy country girl
named Ma Barker.

1355
01:32:56,551 --> 01:33:00,647
There was only one person
who was sorry about Ma Barker:

1356
01:33:00,822 --> 01:33:02,847
Alvin Karpis.

1357
01:33:03,024 --> 01:33:07,290
He was a murderer,
kidnapper and bank robber.

1358
01:33:07,662 --> 01:33:11,962
He announced that he was going
to kill J. Edgar Hoover.

1359
01:33:12,233 --> 01:33:14,565
But it must've slipped his mind...

1360
01:33:14,736 --> 01:33:18,729
...because Mr. Hoover bought
a plane ticket to New Orleans...

1361
01:33:18,907 --> 01:33:21,398
...and walked up and arrested him.

1362
01:33:22,243 --> 01:33:24,541
Karpis, FBI.

1363
01:33:26,047 --> 01:33:30,177
One of the last of the hoodlums
was trapped in a Memphis rooming house.

1364
01:33:30,351 --> 01:33:32,546
His name was "Machine Gun" Kelly.

1365
01:33:33,588 --> 01:33:36,250
He wasn't too brave that night.

1366
01:33:36,424 --> 01:33:40,383
But he did put a new word
into the English language.

1367
01:33:42,563 --> 01:33:45,054
Don't shoot, G-men.

1368
01:33:46,067 --> 01:33:48,331
Don't shoot, G-men!

1369
01:33:50,071 --> 01:33:53,802
In the meantime, they were getting ready
for war in Europe.

1370
01:33:53,975 --> 01:33:57,570
A few compromises later,
they were waging it.

1371
01:33:59,314 --> 01:34:03,808
Here in America, there were groups
like Teutonia in Chicago...

1372
01:34:03,985 --> 01:34:07,546
...and the German-American Bund
in New York.

1373
01:34:07,722 --> 01:34:11,214
They supported the aims
of Nazi Germany.

1374
01:34:11,392 --> 01:34:13,417
Some of the members
were enemy aliens.

1375
01:34:13,594 --> 01:34:16,222
Others were misguided Americans.

1376
01:34:16,397 --> 01:34:19,423
The FBI was detailed
to keep a running file.

1377
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,763
We were to be able to pinpoint
dangerous men and women...

1378
01:34:22,937 --> 01:34:25,497
...in case America became involved.

1379
01:34:27,542 --> 01:34:30,067
Come on, Chip.
We can't pose all day.

1380
01:34:30,244 --> 01:34:33,077
Hold on. Wait a minute.
I wanna get one thing straight here.

1381
01:34:33,247 --> 01:34:36,307
I get all dressed up and all of a sudden
there's no shaving lotion.

1382
01:34:36,484 --> 01:34:40,079
- The camera's all set for 10 feet.
- Daddy, try to get our heads in this time.

1383
01:34:40,254 --> 01:34:42,552
Wait, I wanna find out
about the shaving lotion.

1384
01:34:42,724 --> 01:34:44,055
Sorry, Chip, I don't use it.

1385
01:34:44,225 --> 01:34:47,388
No, never mind. I'm talking to Mike.
How about the shaving lotion?

1386
01:34:47,562 --> 01:34:49,086
I borrowed a couple of drops.

1387
01:34:49,263 --> 01:34:50,821
You borrowed a couple of drops?

1388
01:34:50,999 --> 01:34:53,695
- How long have you been shaving?
- About two or three years.

1389
01:34:53,868 --> 01:34:56,860
- About two or three years.
- Oh, calm down. He'll buy his own.

1390
01:34:57,038 --> 01:34:58,699
If he's been shaving
for two years...

1391
01:34:58,873 --> 01:35:01,171
...don't you think we ought
to say it's permanent?

1392
01:35:01,342 --> 01:35:04,311
You know, that beard of his
isn't a flash in the pan or anything.

1393
01:35:04,479 --> 01:35:06,879
Please hurry, Daddy.
I'm gonna be late for my speech.

1394
01:35:07,048 --> 01:35:09,312
Please, get some shaving lotion,
will you, son?

1395
01:35:09,484 --> 01:35:10,815
Holy smokes, you...

1396
01:35:10,985 --> 01:35:12,247
Gee whiz.

1397
01:35:12,787 --> 01:35:15,312
You're all too spread out here.
I'll have to get...

1398
01:35:15,490 --> 01:35:16,957
Jennie, sit down by your mother.

1399
01:35:17,125 --> 01:35:20,492
Anne, move closer to your mother.
Mike, sit down. I'll cut your head off.

1400
01:35:20,661 --> 01:35:23,994
You have to get closer here
so I can get it in.

1401
01:35:24,165 --> 01:35:26,861
Where is everybody? Oh, all right.

1402
01:35:27,035 --> 01:35:29,333
Dad, you've got your finger
in front of the lens.

1403
01:35:31,739 --> 01:35:34,537
You just be sure and get
the shaving lotion, huh? All right.

1404
01:35:34,709 --> 01:35:38,736
Stop rehearsing your speech, Jennie.
All right. Everybody ready?

1405
01:35:39,747 --> 01:35:43,706
All right, all of you, freeze!

1406
01:35:45,319 --> 01:35:47,787
- Did it go off?
- All right, now, everybody in the car.

1407
01:35:47,955 --> 01:35:49,183
We only have 10 minutes.

1408
01:35:49,357 --> 01:35:52,190
- Did anybody lock the back door?
- Yes, I locked the back door.

1409
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:54,590
Jennie, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1410
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:01,261
It's a gardenia.

1411
01:36:01,436 --> 01:36:04,098
And you see, what we do
is we put it together...

1412
01:36:04,272 --> 01:36:07,673
...with another flower like you,
and then we have a bouquet.

1413
01:36:08,142 --> 01:36:10,201
Thank you, Daddy.

1414
01:36:12,046 --> 01:36:15,072
Golly, I hope I don't forget
my speech.

1415
01:36:16,017 --> 01:36:19,350
- That was a very nice thing to do, dear.
- It isn't a case of being nice.

1416
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:23,183
I just want the people to know
that her father's a man of the world.

1417
01:36:25,626 --> 01:36:28,720
So at this midterm installation of officers
in the Honor Society...

1418
01:36:28,896 --> 01:36:33,333
...it is fitting that we review the qualities
which we hope to possess.

1419
01:36:33,501 --> 01:36:38,996
Those qualities are perseverance,
honesty, scholarship...

1420
01:36:39,173 --> 01:36:41,733
...and reverence
for our sacred institutions.

1421
01:36:42,176 --> 01:36:43,768
I think her speech is the best one.

1422
01:36:43,945 --> 01:36:46,106
These qualities,
applied to our future lives...

1423
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:48,771
- It is, though.
...result in citizenship.

1424
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:53,050
And we, the young people
of Alexandria High...

1425
01:36:53,221 --> 01:36:55,781
...promise not to disappoint you.

1426
01:37:08,936 --> 01:37:13,373
So the qualities
which we have to have...

1427
01:37:14,275 --> 01:37:19,975
...are perseverance, honesty
and reverence...

1428
01:37:20,882 --> 01:37:23,715
Oh, Lord, let her remember.

1429
01:37:25,419 --> 01:37:26,750
I...

1430
01:37:28,689 --> 01:37:31,749
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.

1431
01:37:32,827 --> 01:37:34,488
Oh, the poor thing. Chip, go to her.

1432
01:37:34,662 --> 01:37:36,323
- Oh, yeah.
- Talk to her.

1433
01:37:43,571 --> 01:37:46,062
Let's have a little music,
what do you say.

1434
01:37:49,143 --> 01:37:50,804
There.

1435
01:37:50,978 --> 01:37:56,109
- Now, Jennie, you...
- Oh, Daddy, how can you talk to me?

1436
01:37:56,284 --> 01:37:58,775
How can you bear to talk to me?

1437
01:37:58,953 --> 01:38:00,545
I disgraced you.

1438
01:38:00,721 --> 01:38:03,349
- I disgraced all of you.
- No, you haven't.

1439
01:38:03,524 --> 01:38:06,357
You just didn't finish a speech, that's all.

1440
01:38:06,527 --> 01:38:09,052
There are too many speeches
in the world anyway.

1441
01:38:09,230 --> 01:38:11,027
Daddy, I tried so hard.

1442
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:15,636
I wanted to do it so well,
and then everything went blooey.

1443
01:38:15,803 --> 01:38:18,738
- Oh, now, Jennie...
- Please, Daddy.

1444
01:38:18,906 --> 01:38:21,374
- Let me tell you something.
- Don't give me an example.

1445
01:38:21,542 --> 01:38:23,305
A what? An example?
What...?

1446
01:38:23,477 --> 01:38:25,445
Like you always do.

1447
01:38:25,613 --> 01:38:30,107
How one time Columbus forgot his speech
and then discovered America.

1448
01:38:30,284 --> 01:38:32,081
It won't do any good.

1449
01:38:32,253 --> 01:38:34,187
Oh, I can't face anybody.

1450
01:38:34,355 --> 01:38:37,756
- I can't face anybody the rest of my life.
- Oh, no, now, here, now.

1451
01:38:37,925 --> 01:38:39,859
Now, wait a minute.
You just listen to me.

1452
01:38:40,027 --> 01:38:43,485
You just listen to me. Why do you think
you were up there on that stage?

1453
01:38:43,664 --> 01:38:46,292
Because you're one of the best students.

1454
01:38:46,467 --> 01:38:48,594
That's why you were up there
on that stage.

1455
01:38:48,769 --> 01:38:50,737
Do you think I care what
you tell people...

1456
01:38:50,905 --> 01:38:55,035
...about perseverance and honor
as long as you have them yourself?

1457
01:38:55,343 --> 01:38:58,938
Now, you just remember that,
my fine old friend.

1458
01:39:01,716 --> 01:39:03,479
Yes, sir.

1459
01:39:06,187 --> 01:39:09,884
After this thing's over, aren't we supposed
to have a tea dance or something?

1460
01:39:10,057 --> 01:39:12,082
- Oh, Daddy, I couldn't.
- Come on, come on.

1461
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:14,453
- Please, I just couldn't.
- Right in here.

1462
01:39:14,629 --> 01:39:16,062
You're gonna dance with me.

1463
01:39:16,230 --> 01:39:18,926
You know, I didn't buy that gardenia
just to see it wilt...

1464
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:20,328
...in a puddle of tears.

1465
01:39:20,501 --> 01:39:22,059
Now, here, fix yourself up...

1466
01:39:23,571 --> 01:39:25,732
...and we'll go in
and we'll do the Big Apple.

1467
01:39:30,511 --> 01:39:32,536
We interrupt this broadcast
for a bulletin...

1468
01:39:32,713 --> 01:39:35,307
...from the NBC newsroom,
Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

1469
01:39:35,483 --> 01:39:38,043
Here today, at 7:55 local time...

1470
01:39:38,219 --> 01:39:42,815
...units of the Japanese air force bombarded
American Army and Naval installations.

1471
01:39:45,893 --> 01:39:47,918
Bombs were still falling
on Pearl Harbor...

1472
01:39:48,095 --> 01:39:51,895
...when Director Hoover and the top aides
were on their way into headquarters.

1473
01:39:52,066 --> 01:39:58,301
By 7 p.m. Washington time,
2602 agents had been alerted.

1474
01:39:58,472 --> 01:40:02,932
Immediate roundup of all enemy aliens
was ordered.

1475
01:40:03,110 --> 01:40:06,705
These were enemy aliens,
not law-abiding citizens...

1476
01:40:06,881 --> 01:40:09,941
...of German and Japanese ancestry.

1477
01:40:11,185 --> 01:40:16,885
Within 72 hours, we took into custody
3846 enemy aliens.

1478
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:22,461
When the war started, the bureau
had a little over 2500 agents.

1479
01:40:22,630 --> 01:40:24,257
To handle the new volume of work...

1480
01:40:24,432 --> 01:40:26,764
...the force had to be increased
to more than 5000.

1481
01:40:26,934 --> 01:40:27,923
Ready on the right.

1482
01:40:28,102 --> 01:40:30,434
The new men were sent
to the FBI training center...

1483
01:40:30,604 --> 01:40:33,971
...at the Marine base at Quantico, Virginia.
- Ready on the firing line.

1484
01:40:50,791 --> 01:40:55,160
One of them
was Sam Crandall's son George.

1485
01:40:57,465 --> 01:41:01,162
You're looking at the most expensive
piece of equipment in the entire FBI.

1486
01:41:01,335 --> 01:41:05,169
It was paid for with the lives
of a dozen agents.

1487
01:41:05,339 --> 01:41:07,500
Their deaths have taught us a lot.

1488
01:41:07,675 --> 01:41:09,540
We have cataloged
all of the mistakes...

1489
01:41:09,710 --> 01:41:12,144
...all of the slip-ups
that you can possibly make...

1490
01:41:12,313 --> 01:41:14,679
...and this piece of equipment
is the result.

1491
01:41:14,849 --> 01:41:16,840
It is known as Hogan's Alley.

1492
01:41:17,017 --> 01:41:20,817
It might be a street in Passaic,
or one in Fresno.

1493
01:41:20,988 --> 01:41:24,685
Here are the photographs
of five wanted criminals.

1494
01:41:24,859 --> 01:41:27,054
Study them well.

1495
01:41:27,595 --> 01:41:29,586
You will walk down this street.

1496
01:41:29,764 --> 01:41:32,824
Be prepared to see any of these men.

1497
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,333
Be prepared to kill or be killed.

1498
01:41:36,504 --> 01:41:41,464
Exercise your judgment,
but be sure before you fire.

1499
01:41:41,642 --> 01:41:43,735
Crandall, you'll lead off.

1500
01:41:43,911 --> 01:41:46,072
The rest of you men
proceed to the next range...

1501
01:41:46,247 --> 01:41:49,045
...and stay there until you're sent for.

1502
01:41:52,219 --> 01:41:53,447
How's young Crandall doing?

1503
01:41:53,621 --> 01:41:56,385
Good in some things, slow in others.

1504
01:42:01,028 --> 01:42:05,727
Crandall, with six rounds,
load and holster.

1505
01:42:12,973 --> 01:42:14,497
He has a lot to live up to.

1506
01:42:14,675 --> 01:42:16,575
He sure has.

1507
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:19,107
Start walking.

1508
01:42:23,918 --> 01:42:26,045
Very good, Crandall.

1509
01:42:35,329 --> 01:42:37,797
No, you just shot the barber.

1510
01:42:38,732 --> 01:42:41,496
Granted, there might be a gun
under that towel.

1511
01:42:41,669 --> 01:42:46,402
You should have held this man at gunpoint
and had him identify himself.

1512
01:42:53,013 --> 01:42:55,447
That's one of the armed fugitives,
Crandall.

1513
01:42:55,616 --> 01:42:59,746
While you're standing there thinking
about it, this man just took your life.

1514
01:43:08,529 --> 01:43:10,224
You are right in firing.

1515
01:43:10,397 --> 01:43:14,629
However, you should fire at the head
rather than the stomach...

1516
01:43:14,802 --> 01:43:18,966
...because it's obvious that
this man is wearing body armor.

1517
01:43:27,982 --> 01:43:31,349
You should have fired
at the man with the shotgun first...

1518
01:43:31,719 --> 01:43:34,711
...because his weapon
makes him more dangerous.

1519
01:43:47,034 --> 01:43:51,266
You just shot an FBI agent, Crandall,
searching the premises.

1520
01:43:51,438 --> 01:43:54,305
Unload and holster your weapon.

1521
01:43:58,178 --> 01:44:01,773
Send us the next man
for Hogan's Alley.

1522
01:44:04,285 --> 01:44:06,150
- Hi, George.
- Hello, Mr. Hardesty.

1523
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:07,844
- Hello, Mr. Sloan.
- Hello, George.

1524
01:44:08,022 --> 01:44:09,990
- I'll see you later, Hank.
- Okay, sir.

1525
01:44:10,157 --> 01:44:11,988
Well, how's it going?

1526
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:14,684
If they turn me loose,
I'll do away with the whole FBI.

1527
01:44:14,862 --> 01:44:17,695
We're barbecuing a couple of steaks
over at the house tonight.

1528
01:44:17,865 --> 01:44:20,265
- Thought you might like to drop over.
- Yes, sir.

1529
01:44:20,434 --> 01:44:22,299
How's Anne?
And Mrs. Hardesty, of course?

1530
01:44:22,469 --> 01:44:24,096
They're fine. Fine.

1531
01:44:25,839 --> 01:44:27,204
The truth is, Mr. Hardesty...

1532
01:44:27,374 --> 01:44:30,810
...you may not want me to come over
to the house. When you hear, at least.

1533
01:44:30,978 --> 01:44:33,037
I don't wanna continue with the FBI.

1534
01:44:33,213 --> 01:44:35,374
No? Well, that's very interesting.

1535
01:44:35,549 --> 01:44:36,880
I don't wanna continue...

1536
01:44:37,051 --> 01:44:39,884
...and I'd appreciate if you wouldn't
try to talk me into it.

1537
01:44:40,054 --> 01:44:41,578
No, I won't.

1538
01:44:41,755 --> 01:44:45,156
As a matter of fact, the last person
I remember tried a thing like that...

1539
01:44:45,326 --> 01:44:48,261
...was Sam Crandall, your father.

1540
01:44:49,129 --> 01:44:51,359
Seven o'clock be all right?

1541
01:44:51,832 --> 01:44:53,094
Fine.

1542
01:44:55,636 --> 01:44:57,399
Very good.

1543
01:45:17,625 --> 01:45:20,788
Keep the fire low, Daddy.
You always burn things.

1544
01:45:20,961 --> 01:45:24,158
Oh, thank you, dear. Thank you.
I'll try and manage.

1545
01:45:24,331 --> 01:45:27,528
Now, you take care of the music.
I'll take care of burning things.

1546
01:45:32,806 --> 01:45:35,866
You think that fire's low enough?
You always burn things, you know.

1547
01:45:36,043 --> 01:45:38,739
- Wonder what's keeping Mike.
- Probably a late class.

1548
01:45:38,912 --> 01:45:41,176
You want a pickle? Here, give me that.

1549
01:45:41,348 --> 01:45:43,873
Hey, have you noticed
Anne and George?

1550
01:45:44,051 --> 01:45:45,643
You think that's serious?

1551
01:45:45,819 --> 01:45:47,787
He's been in love with her
since he was 10.

1552
01:45:47,955 --> 01:45:52,153
- Would you call that serious?
- Well, it's stubborn, anyway.

1553
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:54,890
I don't know why
you can't be an FBI man.

1554
01:45:55,062 --> 01:45:58,031
I just have no respect for you.
No respect at all.

1555
01:45:58,198 --> 01:46:00,826
If you had a reason,
just one good reason.

1556
01:46:01,001 --> 01:46:02,662
I've been trying to explain.

1557
01:46:02,836 --> 01:46:05,270
I'm not as good as my father.
I never will be.

1558
01:46:05,439 --> 01:46:08,738
Suit yourself.
I just have no respect for you.

1559
01:46:17,851 --> 01:46:20,820
I want you to hear
a real piece of music.

1560
01:46:40,174 --> 01:46:44,406
Michael Hardesty,
United States Marine Corps.

1561
01:46:44,578 --> 01:46:46,068
I signed up today.

1562
01:46:48,649 --> 01:46:51,117
What do you mean, you signed up?

1563
01:46:51,752 --> 01:46:54,983
Well, I guess he means
he signed the papers.

1564
01:46:55,556 --> 01:46:59,356
But he has school to finish.
There's no reason.

1565
01:46:59,526 --> 01:47:02,256
- Please, Mother.
- He wasn't even called.

1566
01:47:02,429 --> 01:47:06,058
Being called is one thing,
rushing out and signing up is another.

1567
01:47:06,233 --> 01:47:08,793
- What has that got to do with it?
- Well, everything.

1568
01:47:08,969 --> 01:47:11,767
You should have talked to us.
It was cruel and wrong.

1569
01:47:11,939 --> 01:47:13,907
You should have said something.

1570
01:47:14,074 --> 01:47:17,601
Well, he did, Lucy.
He talked to me.

1571
01:47:19,246 --> 01:47:21,180
And you said nothing?

1572
01:47:21,348 --> 01:47:24,078
Not one word about my son?

1573
01:47:24,251 --> 01:47:27,812
Well, I didn't know
he was going right out and sign up.

1574
01:47:28,789 --> 01:47:30,848
How dare you.

1575
01:47:31,024 --> 01:47:34,551
Look at him. Look how young he is.

1576
01:47:34,928 --> 01:47:37,692
How could you have done such a thing?

1577
01:47:50,077 --> 01:47:53,604
I don't know what else
I could have done, Lucy.

1578
01:47:54,181 --> 01:47:58,811
My son came to me and said
that he wanted to defend his country.

1579
01:47:58,986 --> 01:48:01,318
It was just as plain as that.

1580
01:48:02,189 --> 01:48:05,488
And I couldn't think
of a reason why not.

1581
01:48:05,659 --> 01:48:07,957
If I could have,
I'd have been ashamed of myself.

1582
01:48:08,629 --> 01:48:10,859
Well, there was no reason
to encourage him.

1583
01:48:11,031 --> 01:48:13,625
Look at him. He's just a boy.

1584
01:48:16,336 --> 01:48:19,828
Well, that's the trouble, Lucy.
Most soldiers are boys.

1585
01:48:22,409 --> 01:48:25,207
For a while it seemed we would
spend the rest of our lives...

1586
01:48:25,379 --> 01:48:27,609
...in railroad stations.

1587
01:48:27,781 --> 01:48:31,148
Early that year,
Jennie went off to nursing school.

1588
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:35,514
And somebody
must have talked to George...

1589
01:48:37,191 --> 01:48:40,592
...because he finished his bureau training
and was sent out on assignment.

1590
01:48:46,700 --> 01:48:49,396
Mike shipped out that March
for the central Pacific.

1591
01:48:49,570 --> 01:48:53,631
In time for Saipan and Iwo Jima,
we heard later.

1592
01:49:04,918 --> 01:49:08,547
In the meantime, the bureau
was involved in a new activity.

1593
01:49:08,722 --> 01:49:11,452
A number of South American countries
remained neutral.

1594
01:49:11,625 --> 01:49:15,117
German espionage agents
were operating freely.

1595
01:49:15,295 --> 01:49:17,263
The FBI was asked to move in.

1596
01:49:17,431 --> 01:49:19,797
A special intelligence service
was created...

1597
01:49:19,967 --> 01:49:23,630
...and within 90 days, we had men
operating in 15 different countries.

1598
01:49:23,804 --> 01:49:25,101
They were all undercover...

1599
01:49:25,272 --> 01:49:30,505
...posing as American businessmen,
writers, technicians, salesmen.

1600
01:49:31,345 --> 01:49:32,937
Our men did a little of everything.

1601
01:49:33,113 --> 01:49:36,549
They intercepted German transmissions
on our ship movements.

1602
01:49:36,717 --> 01:49:39,914
They spotted submarine-refueling spots.

1603
01:49:42,856 --> 01:49:46,656
However, things weren't going
so well in one of the countries.

1604
01:49:46,827 --> 01:49:49,591
Federal police were arresting our men.

1605
01:49:49,763 --> 01:49:52,493
They were being imprisoned
without trial.

1606
01:49:53,333 --> 01:49:55,961
So the director ordered me
to South America.

1607
01:49:56,136 --> 01:49:57,967
My instructions were simple:

1608
01:49:58,138 --> 01:50:01,972
There were three agents operating
in danger areas.

1609
01:50:02,142 --> 01:50:05,236
We had reason to believe
their real identifies had been discovered.

1610
01:50:05,412 --> 01:50:07,972
I was to contact them,
relieve them of duty...

1611
01:50:08,148 --> 01:50:09,672
...send them home immediately.

1612
01:50:10,550 --> 01:50:13,781
I found my first man
at the International Club.

1613
01:50:14,288 --> 01:50:15,755
The second agent I contacted...

1614
01:50:15,923 --> 01:50:19,222
...was driving a cab
near the German embassy.

1615
01:50:26,133 --> 01:50:29,102
- Take me to the airport, will you?
- Any luggage, señor?

1616
01:50:29,269 --> 01:50:31,635
I'm not going anywhere, you are.

1617
01:50:32,606 --> 01:50:34,767
Yes, Mr. Hardesty.

1618
01:50:43,350 --> 01:50:46,046
Our third agent wasn't so easy to get to.

1619
01:50:46,219 --> 01:50:48,881
He was operating a secret transmitter...

1620
01:50:49,056 --> 01:50:52,514
...up on the western slope
a few miles from the Brazilian border.

1621
01:50:52,693 --> 01:50:56,151
Mario, a native contact, was guiding me.

1622
01:50:59,566 --> 01:51:01,830
- You wish to rest, señor?
- No, let's keep going.

1623
01:51:02,102 --> 01:51:06,402
I have been in these hills for all my life,
and always I walk up.

1624
01:51:06,573 --> 01:51:07,870
Never down.

1625
01:51:08,041 --> 01:51:12,569
I think God, he forgot to make
the other side of the hill, sir.

1626
01:51:55,856 --> 01:51:59,724
The water, she leads into the big river.

1627
01:51:59,893 --> 01:52:02,225
And the river,
she leads into the ocean.

1628
01:52:02,396 --> 01:52:04,728
- You have seen the ocean, señor?
- A few times.

1629
01:52:05,232 --> 01:52:06,631
You are very lucky.

1630
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:08,631
I have seen it only in pictures.

1631
01:52:08,802 --> 01:52:11,965
But someday in my life,
I will visit the ocean.

1632
01:52:12,139 --> 01:52:14,334
I will do it by hooks or crook.

1633
01:52:14,875 --> 01:52:16,342
How much further, Mario?

1634
01:52:16,777 --> 01:52:18,870
One more hill, señor.

1635
01:52:19,046 --> 01:52:20,536
It is up.

1636
01:52:20,714 --> 01:52:22,511
Naturally.

1637
01:52:22,682 --> 01:52:23,774
Naturally.

1638
01:52:37,998 --> 01:52:40,466
I have brought him, Señor George.

1639
01:52:40,834 --> 01:52:42,165
Hi, George.

1640
01:52:42,335 --> 01:52:44,132
Mr. Hardesty.

1641
01:52:44,504 --> 01:52:46,904
- Well, it's wonderful to see you.
- All right.

1642
01:52:47,074 --> 01:52:48,769
- You're looking pretty good.
- Thanks.

1643
01:52:48,942 --> 01:52:52,173
Hey, I just happened to be passing by,
I thought I'd drop in.

1644
01:52:52,345 --> 01:52:54,609
Say, do you have a drink of water?
I'm out.

1645
01:52:54,781 --> 01:52:56,681
Yes, sir. Come on in out of the sun.

1646
01:52:56,850 --> 01:52:59,648
- Oh, boy, that's quite a climb.
- I know it.

1647
01:53:01,855 --> 01:53:03,755
Why, thank you.

1648
01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:07,387
Well, this is our...

1649
01:53:07,561 --> 01:53:10,758
...combination radio room,
kitchen and bedroom.

1650
01:53:10,931 --> 01:53:11,920
I see.

1651
01:53:12,099 --> 01:53:17,230
And over there is a stable,
sunroom and veranda.

1652
01:53:17,404 --> 01:53:18,803
Well, that's...

1653
01:53:19,005 --> 01:53:22,839
Well, I hate to break up
this cozy little home away from home...

1654
01:53:23,009 --> 01:53:24,977
...but you're ordered
to leave immediately.

1655
01:53:25,145 --> 01:53:28,876
- But there's still a lot to be done.
- There's a lot to be done everywhere.

1656
01:53:29,049 --> 01:53:31,176
But we can operate in other countries.

1657
01:53:31,351 --> 01:53:34,809
You're too hot here, so you're
to pull the plug and report to Washington.

1658
01:53:34,988 --> 01:53:37,320
Now, come on,
I'll help you pack your gear.

1659
01:53:37,491 --> 01:53:39,083
Mario...

1660
01:53:39,259 --> 01:53:40,658
...come on, we're moving out.

1661
01:53:41,428 --> 01:53:42,793
Down the hill, señor?

1662
01:53:43,497 --> 01:53:45,226
Downhill.

1663
01:53:46,266 --> 01:53:47,756
Besides, George...

1664
01:53:47,934 --> 01:53:50,835
...as I recall, you've got
a pretty good reason for going back.

1665
01:53:51,004 --> 01:53:53,165
Yes, sir. How is she?

1666
01:53:53,406 --> 01:53:54,896
She's a bore.

1667
01:53:55,075 --> 01:53:56,508
All she does is talk about you.

1668
01:53:56,676 --> 01:53:59,839
I'll be glad when you get back there.
She can bore you.

1669
01:54:03,483 --> 01:54:05,644
- It's Gerschner.
- Gerschner?

1670
01:54:06,153 --> 01:54:07,450
When was the last intercept?

1671
01:54:07,621 --> 01:54:11,057
Not since July. Big contraband shipment.
Radio silence ever since.

1672
01:54:20,967 --> 01:54:23,663
The birds, they do not fly for nothing.

1673
01:54:29,042 --> 01:54:30,873
Something's coming in.

1674
01:54:32,045 --> 01:54:33,512
All right.

1675
01:54:34,447 --> 01:54:38,406
"Cargo of smuggled platinum...

1676
01:54:38,885 --> 01:54:41,012
...on its way...

1677
01:54:41,388 --> 01:54:45,757
...to Buenos Aires."

1678
01:55:09,382 --> 01:55:11,145
"Gerschner...

1679
01:55:11,918 --> 01:55:15,718
...will rendezvous...

1680
01:55:15,889 --> 01:55:19,450
...near Porto Coimbra."

1681
01:55:21,027 --> 01:55:23,427
All right, try and reach
our São Paulo contact.

1682
01:55:23,597 --> 01:55:25,497
Where's your codebook?

1683
01:55:27,234 --> 01:55:29,168
I'll code, you send.

1684
01:55:36,810 --> 01:55:37,902
I've got them.

1685
01:55:39,546 --> 01:55:42,379
Señor, the federales,
they are coming up the hill.

1686
01:55:42,582 --> 01:55:44,015
What?

1687
01:55:48,688 --> 01:55:50,781
Well, I'm afraid you're right.

1688
01:55:51,224 --> 01:55:54,557
But we can't leave now, Mario.
You better just pray.

1689
01:55:59,132 --> 01:56:02,863
I will say to God that he should
tilt the hill a little bit more.

1690
01:56:14,781 --> 01:56:17,341
- "Message received and acknowledged."
- Sign off.

1691
01:56:18,184 --> 01:56:20,414
Let's destroy this equipment
and get out of here.

1692
01:56:20,587 --> 01:56:21,645
Burn that codebook.

1693
01:56:21,821 --> 01:56:24,381
- Where are your detonators?
- Mario, detonators.

1694
01:56:36,336 --> 01:56:38,167
I just need one.

1695
01:56:49,215 --> 01:56:52,378
That's all right. Come on.
Come on, Mario, hurry up.

1696
01:57:02,762 --> 01:57:05,060
Come on, come on, get down here.

1697
01:57:12,906 --> 01:57:15,807
Come on. Come on.

1698
01:57:20,613 --> 01:57:22,513
All right, let's go.

1699
01:57:53,446 --> 01:57:56,006
Brazil, after the bridge.
It is two kilometers to there.

1700
01:57:56,182 --> 01:57:57,843
Come on, let's go.

1701
01:58:22,308 --> 01:58:24,538
- Mario!
- Mario!

1702
01:58:25,412 --> 01:58:27,380
Mario!

1703
01:58:36,222 --> 01:58:38,087
Mario!

1704
02:00:46,319 --> 02:00:49,049
Is that the river
that runs down to the sea?

1705
02:00:49,222 --> 02:00:51,690
I guess so. Why?

1706
02:00:52,392 --> 02:00:54,417
Poor Mario.

1707
02:01:01,868 --> 02:01:07,431
George Crandall came home
to what he called "easier duty."

1708
02:01:09,709 --> 02:01:14,646
In February of 1945, he and Anne
celebrated their first wedding anniversary.

1709
02:01:14,814 --> 02:01:17,374
- Hey, this calls for some music.
- Right.

1710
02:01:22,889 --> 02:01:24,254
Hey, this is very good.

1711
02:01:24,424 --> 02:01:28,383
Only, if you're married to her,
it really should be devil's food.

1712
02:01:28,561 --> 02:01:30,791
- Let's go read some of the telegrams.
- Good idea.

1713
02:01:30,964 --> 02:01:33,262
Come on, honey.
Serve the cake, Jennie.

1714
02:01:35,868 --> 02:01:38,063
Just a minute.

1715
02:01:41,140 --> 02:01:43,199
From my Aunt Edith.

1716
02:01:43,376 --> 02:01:45,776
- She says I'm lucky.
- Well, you are.

1717
02:01:45,945 --> 02:01:49,278
You can read all those wires later.
Come on, let's do some singing here.

1718
02:02:15,308 --> 02:02:16,366
Once again, once again.

1719
02:02:22,782 --> 02:02:25,012
Another one, ma'am,
for Mr. And Mrs. Hardesty.

1720
02:02:25,184 --> 02:02:28,244
Oh, well, I guess
somebody's congratulating us.

1721
02:02:30,556 --> 02:02:33,218
- There you are. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1722
02:02:48,408 --> 02:02:50,433
Oh, my God.

1723
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:37,151
He died at 5:25 a.m.

1724
02:03:38,458 --> 02:03:41,427
He didn't even make it through sunrise.

1725
02:03:43,796 --> 02:03:45,457
Why?

1726
02:03:48,101 --> 02:03:49,864
Why?

1727
02:03:50,570 --> 02:03:54,233
Why does it always
have to be this way?

1728
02:03:56,309 --> 02:04:00,040
All my life in the bureau, Lucy,
I've been dealing with punks.

1729
02:04:00,213 --> 02:04:02,807
They rob banks and they hold up
filling stations...

1730
02:04:02,982 --> 02:04:06,349
...and they shoot down
innocent people.

1731
02:04:06,519 --> 02:04:08,749
A bunch of cheap punks.

1732
02:04:08,921 --> 02:04:13,153
Why is it nothing ever happens to them?
Where were they at Iwo Jima?

1733
02:04:13,826 --> 02:04:16,590
How dare you say that?

1734
02:04:17,230 --> 02:04:19,198
I don't know anything about Iwo Jima...

1735
02:04:19,365 --> 02:04:22,562
...except the papers
say a lot of boys died there.

1736
02:04:22,735 --> 02:04:26,728
But I think it'd be awful, just awful,
if they were punks.

1737
02:04:26,906 --> 02:04:28,669
I hope they were like Mike.

1738
02:04:28,841 --> 02:04:31,002
I hope every last one of them
was like Mike.

1739
02:04:31,177 --> 02:04:34,408
And I don't care if all the punks
in the world go right on living.

1740
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:37,071
Mike was too good for that.

1741
02:04:38,151 --> 02:04:40,051
You know, you're right.

1742
02:04:40,219 --> 02:04:42,153
You're right.

1743
02:04:42,321 --> 02:04:46,621
But it's just that when I think of him...

1744
02:04:46,793 --> 02:04:51,696
...and when I think of how I used to
accuse him of stealing things from me...

1745
02:04:51,864 --> 02:04:53,092
...you remember?

1746
02:04:53,266 --> 02:04:57,134
Shaving lotion and socks, and...
And I...

1747
02:04:59,138 --> 02:05:03,006
I just never thought he'd take anything
this big away from me.

1748
02:05:05,912 --> 02:05:08,847
The only thing that I worry about...

1749
02:05:09,582 --> 02:05:12,142
...is he might have suffered.

1750
02:05:14,187 --> 02:05:16,314
Do you think he did, Chip?

1751
02:05:17,256 --> 02:05:19,156
I don't know.

1752
02:05:19,859 --> 02:05:21,827
I don't know.

1753
02:05:22,195 --> 02:05:26,325
But somehow, I doubt it.

1754
02:05:26,499 --> 02:05:30,162
Most soldiers
just seem to die in a hurry.

1755
02:05:30,336 --> 02:05:33,863
And maybe it's supposed
to be like that.

1756
02:05:35,208 --> 02:05:37,768
You mean there isn't time
for a prayer?

1757
02:05:40,513 --> 02:05:42,879
There's time to start one.

1758
02:05:44,483 --> 02:05:49,386
And that's really all that counts, isn't it?

1759
02:05:52,058 --> 02:05:53,320
I suppose so.

1760
02:05:53,492 --> 02:05:57,428
No, but it's true. It's true.

1761
02:05:57,597 --> 02:06:04,093
My daddy always used to say
if you start a prayer and die...

1762
02:06:06,038 --> 02:06:11,101
...well, that just means that you get
a chance to finish it in person.

1763
02:06:13,179 --> 02:06:15,010
See?

1764
02:06:22,788 --> 02:06:25,621
We'd better go in
and talk to the others.

1765
02:06:31,330 --> 02:06:35,824
My goodness, he was handsome
in his uniform, wasn't he?

1766
02:06:36,602 --> 02:06:39,196
He looks proud.

1767
02:06:39,906 --> 02:06:42,500
He looks as if he intended to win.

1768
02:06:42,675 --> 02:06:45,667
And I'll bet that's the way it was, too.

1769
02:06:45,845 --> 02:06:49,246
When he started up that beach,
he meant to win.

1770
02:06:49,415 --> 02:06:55,911
And that's why I wish
I had one more moment to talk to him.

1771
02:06:56,455 --> 02:07:00,516
Not to hug him and tell him I love him,
but just to say:

1772
02:07:01,494 --> 02:07:03,519
"You won.

1773
02:07:03,863 --> 02:07:07,060
That's the God's honest truth, Mike.

1774
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:09,800
You won."

1775
02:07:26,552 --> 02:07:31,546
The war was over, but not for the FBI.

1776
02:07:31,724 --> 02:07:36,491
Now the enemy
was international Communism.

1777
02:07:36,996 --> 02:07:39,794
It threatened education...

1778
02:07:40,299 --> 02:07:42,893
...labor and management...

1779
02:07:43,502 --> 02:07:45,936
...Church and the home.

1780
02:07:46,105 --> 02:07:50,405
And yet communists could be found
in all of these places.

1781
02:07:51,210 --> 02:07:55,476
They gave speeches,
wrote pamphlets, stirred up trouble.

1782
02:07:55,648 --> 02:07:57,843
Some of them weren't that polite.

1783
02:07:58,017 --> 02:07:59,985
They betrayed their country.

1784
02:08:00,486 --> 02:08:03,182
Active espionage
came into sharp focus...

1785
02:08:04,757 --> 02:08:07,248
...at a small cleaning
and pressing shop in the Bronx.

1786
02:08:07,426 --> 02:08:10,156
An unexpected thing happened.

1787
02:08:11,230 --> 02:08:13,994
A tiny mistake was made.

1788
02:08:23,843 --> 02:08:25,538
Nobody ever learns.

1789
02:08:29,148 --> 02:08:31,708
Fifty-cent piece in the watch pocket.

1790
02:08:35,221 --> 02:08:37,519
Sandy, where did you get this suit?

1791
02:08:37,690 --> 02:08:40,250
Sandy, where did you get this suit?

1792
02:08:44,530 --> 02:08:46,293
Rooming house
over on Kingsbridge, why?

1793
02:08:46,465 --> 02:08:47,796
I'd like to meet the fella.

1794
02:08:47,967 --> 02:08:50,094
He don't have to wait
for any cigarette change.

1795
02:08:50,269 --> 02:08:52,794
His money just breaks in pieces.

1796
02:08:57,610 --> 02:09:02,104
The pants presser notified the New York
Field Office of the bureau.

1797
02:09:02,281 --> 02:09:04,442
Agents were sent out.

1798
02:09:04,617 --> 02:09:06,585
Then the man
didn't give you the suit?

1799
02:09:06,752 --> 02:09:08,117
No, the landlady.

1800
02:09:08,287 --> 02:09:11,085
This fella piles it outside his door
before he goes to work.

1801
02:09:11,257 --> 02:09:12,781
The landlady, she gives it to me.

1802
02:09:12,958 --> 02:09:15,392
It happens lots of times.

1803
02:09:17,730 --> 02:09:20,927
One thing didn't happen lots of times.

1804
02:09:21,100 --> 02:09:24,467
The 50-cent piece
contained microfilm.

1805
02:09:24,637 --> 02:09:27,435
It was rushed to Washington
for breakdown.

1806
02:09:27,606 --> 02:09:30,700
It was in code. We had no key.

1807
02:09:30,876 --> 02:09:32,468
A copy was made...

1808
02:09:32,645 --> 02:09:38,413
...and then the microfilm, coin and suit
were returned to the suspect's room.

1809
02:09:39,351 --> 02:09:42,184
We checked out the landlady
and then questioned her.

1810
02:09:42,354 --> 02:09:45,551
Then the suit wasn't with
the regular bundle of stuff to be sent out?

1811
02:09:45,724 --> 02:09:47,749
No, it was hanging in the closet.

1812
02:09:47,927 --> 02:09:49,622
But it looked all wrinkled.

1813
02:09:49,795 --> 02:09:51,990
So I thought I'd treat him to a press.

1814
02:09:52,164 --> 02:09:54,598
- On the house, you'd sort of say.
- I see.

1815
02:09:54,767 --> 02:09:59,727
He's a nice fella.
Appreciates it when you do him a favor.

1816
02:10:00,406 --> 02:10:03,432
A 24-hour watch
was put on the house.

1817
02:10:03,609 --> 02:10:05,600
Other preliminary work was being done.

1818
02:10:05,778 --> 02:10:09,976
In the meantime, I'd been sent
to New York to direct the case.

1819
02:10:10,149 --> 02:10:12,640
We got field reports on the suspect.

1820
02:10:12,818 --> 02:10:16,982
He was an American citizen
born in Benton Harbor, Michigan.

1821
02:10:17,156 --> 02:10:19,090
He attended college in the Midwest.

1822
02:10:19,258 --> 02:10:23,092
While there, he was a member
of the Young Communist League.

1823
02:10:23,262 --> 02:10:26,698
After college, he was a member
of half a dozen front groups.

1824
02:10:26,866 --> 02:10:32,634
And then, suddenly and mysteriously,
two years ago, he dropped all affiliations.

1825
02:10:34,540 --> 02:10:38,704
That night, we got our first look
at the suspect.

1826
02:10:40,179 --> 02:10:43,580
He fit the first law of espionage:

1827
02:10:43,749 --> 02:10:46,149
He looked ordinary.

1828
02:10:46,318 --> 02:10:48,809
His habits were routine.

1829
02:10:48,988 --> 02:10:53,857
He worked quietly as a bookbinder
in a 14th Street printing shop.

1830
02:10:57,329 --> 02:11:00,924
Later that week,
we got more than a look at him.

1831
02:11:01,267 --> 02:11:03,428
He left the house.

1832
02:11:03,602 --> 02:11:07,265
An hour later,
he arrived in Central Park.

1833
02:11:08,307 --> 02:11:12,573
It looked as if he was on his way
to make a contact.

1834
02:11:13,212 --> 02:11:16,238
He headed for one of the cages...

1835
02:11:16,982 --> 02:11:20,383
...and there he met a man named
George Metzger...

1836
02:11:20,553 --> 02:11:22,851
...a known espionage agent.

1837
02:11:23,022 --> 02:11:25,582
We'd been conducting
a surveillance on him for months...

1838
02:11:25,758 --> 02:11:30,320
...but had not made an arrest,
hoping he'd lead us to a higher-up.

1839
02:11:30,696 --> 02:11:33,028
Maybe we'd found him.

1840
02:11:34,266 --> 02:11:35,995
We assembled additional information.

1841
02:11:36,168 --> 02:11:38,398
Indictments were returned
and warrants issued.

1842
02:11:38,571 --> 02:11:43,270
The charge was espionage,
a capital crime punishable by death.

1843
02:11:44,143 --> 02:11:46,008
The biggest concentration
of personnel...

1844
02:11:46,178 --> 02:11:49,477
...will be around the suspect's home
in the Kingsbridge area.

1845
02:11:49,648 --> 02:11:52,845
- But of course, where we must be...
- We enlarged the surveillance team.

1846
02:11:53,018 --> 02:11:55,680
Plans were worked out so that
we could case the subject...

1847
02:11:55,854 --> 02:11:58,220
...at any place in Greater New York,
day or night.

1848
02:11:58,390 --> 02:11:59,618
There's your man.

1849
02:11:59,792 --> 02:12:01,282
We gave him the code name...

1850
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:04,657
- His code name, Whitey.
...Whitey.

1851
02:12:04,830 --> 02:12:10,632
For a week, he did nothing
but go to work and return.

1852
02:12:15,841 --> 02:12:17,706
- Yeah, go ahead.
- N. Y. 64...

1853
02:12:17,876 --> 02:12:21,744
On Sunday morning, he left the house.

1854
02:12:21,914 --> 02:12:23,848
He couldn't be going to work.

1855
02:12:24,016 --> 02:12:25,244
Okay, thank you.

1856
02:12:25,417 --> 02:12:29,615
Since he was a communist,
we knew he wasn't going to church.

1857
02:12:29,788 --> 02:12:33,588
Mr. Hoover, Whitey left his house at 8:15.
8:15, destination unknown.

1858
02:12:33,759 --> 02:12:36,353
I had an open line
to Mr. Hoover in Washington.

1859
02:12:36,528 --> 02:12:39,156
- Yes, sir.
- His instructions were simple:

1860
02:12:39,331 --> 02:12:42,459
"Stay with our man
until we can establish the last link...

1861
02:12:42,635 --> 02:12:44,865
...actual transfer of information."

1862
02:12:45,037 --> 02:12:47,767
Get me Supervisor 12.

1863
02:13:00,519 --> 02:13:02,419
There he is.

1864
02:13:03,122 --> 02:13:06,353
N.Y. 32 to N.Y. 19,
in control and dropping.

1865
02:13:06,525 --> 02:13:07,753
He's all yours.

1866
02:13:07,926 --> 02:13:10,326
Whitey is boarding elevated
at Kingsbridge Road.

1867
02:13:10,496 --> 02:13:12,157
Our footmen are on him.

1868
02:13:17,002 --> 02:13:20,631
Operator 19 will report 1100.

1869
02:14:30,042 --> 02:14:32,374
What's the latest position report
on Whitey?

1870
02:14:32,544 --> 02:14:35,809
Still aboard at Chambers Street.
It's an express.

1871
02:14:35,981 --> 02:14:39,280
The next uncovered spot
is Bowling Green.

1872
02:14:39,918 --> 02:14:43,115
All right, get the nearest units
down to Bowling Green.

1873
02:15:56,061 --> 02:15:58,154
Mr. Hardesty.

1874
02:15:59,531 --> 02:16:02,796
Whitey boarded uptown
IRT at Bowling Green.

1875
02:16:02,968 --> 02:16:04,230
Right.

1876
02:16:06,271 --> 02:16:07,670
Go ahead.

1877
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:10,001
Sir, he's trying to shake
the surveillance.

1878
02:16:10,175 --> 02:16:11,665
Do you have sufficient manpower?

1879
02:16:11,844 --> 02:16:14,904
Yes, sir. It looks as if he intends
to pass the coin to Metzger.

1880
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:16,877
- Stay right on him.
- Yes, sir.

1881
02:16:17,049 --> 02:16:20,416
- Do you have men on Metzger?
- Yes, sir, we're on him too.

1882
02:18:15,467 --> 02:18:18,129
Hot dogs to your seat.

1883
02:18:19,071 --> 02:18:20,971
Hot dogs.

1884
02:18:22,040 --> 02:18:24,531
Hot dogs here.

1885
02:18:24,910 --> 02:18:27,003
- Hot dogs...
- We'll take one of them.

1886
02:19:02,948 --> 02:19:04,540
This is Silvano.

1887
02:19:04,716 --> 02:19:10,951
I have Whitey at Yankee Stadium.
Mezzanine, section six, row F, seat 22.

1888
02:19:11,123 --> 02:19:14,684
- I'll need some help right away.
- Okay, I have it.

1889
02:19:15,460 --> 02:19:19,556
Send all units to Yankee Stadium.
Cover the exits.

1890
02:19:26,438 --> 02:19:27,666
Hot dogs here.

1891
02:19:27,839 --> 02:19:29,306
- Hey.
- Hey.

1892
02:19:29,474 --> 02:19:31,374
- Have a hot dog.
- We'll take one of them.

1893
02:21:20,819 --> 02:21:24,084
Whitey disappeared into the crowd.
Gonna be rough picking him up again.

1894
02:21:24,256 --> 02:21:26,281
How many men
have moved into the area?

1895
02:21:27,192 --> 02:21:29,387
All right. Thanks.

1896
02:22:16,274 --> 02:22:19,505
Hit the phone. Move fast.
He'll be tough to hold. License: 7373.

1897
02:22:19,678 --> 02:22:21,509
Come with me.

1898
02:22:40,932 --> 02:22:42,695
This is N. Y. 15.

1899
02:22:42,868 --> 02:22:45,496
I've spotted Silvano
following Whitey's cab.

1900
02:22:45,670 --> 02:22:47,831
I'm taking over the surveillance
from Silvano...

1901
02:22:48,406 --> 02:22:51,534
...and moving south in Central Park.

1902
02:22:58,984 --> 02:23:00,975
N. Y. 15, this is the floral truck.

1903
02:23:01,152 --> 02:23:03,586
We're paralleling you
on Central Park West.

1904
02:23:03,755 --> 02:23:06,223
If you get hot, we'll take over.

1905
02:23:06,391 --> 02:23:10,088
Floral truck, this is N.Y. 15.
We'll let you know.

1906
02:23:29,180 --> 02:23:31,080
We're blocked in.
Flower truck, take over.

1907
02:23:31,583 --> 02:23:33,107
Got him.

1908
02:23:41,860 --> 02:23:44,727
Whitey going south
on Central Park West.

1909
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:13,819
He's out of the cab,
walking east on 46th Street.

1910
02:24:29,975 --> 02:24:32,842
Whitey entering Broadway Joe's,
West 46th Street.

1911
02:24:33,011 --> 02:24:35,172
Our man following him.

1912
02:24:53,498 --> 02:24:54,487
Hardesty.

1913
02:24:54,666 --> 02:24:58,796
N. Y. 21 tailing George Metzger
reports subject just left subway.

1914
02:24:58,970 --> 02:25:01,302
Is walking west on 46th Street.

1915
02:25:01,473 --> 02:25:03,668
Okay, I have it.

1916
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,662
Ham on rye, please, and coffee.

1917
02:25:42,514 --> 02:25:44,982
Control, this is N. Y. 21.

1918
02:25:45,150 --> 02:25:47,584
Whitey has made his contact.

1919
02:25:49,754 --> 02:25:51,085
They're together, sir.

1920
02:25:51,256 --> 02:25:53,690
- Where?
- A café on West 46th Street.

1921
02:25:53,858 --> 02:25:56,725
- Arrest them when the coin is passed.
- Yes, sir.

1922
02:26:27,192 --> 02:26:28,420
What is this?

1923
02:26:28,593 --> 02:26:31,824
We've got warrants for your arrest.
The charge is espionage.

1924
02:26:33,498 --> 02:26:35,261
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1925
02:26:35,433 --> 02:26:38,561
That's all right, we do. Let's go.

1926
02:26:48,113 --> 02:26:49,740
Good.

1927
02:26:51,049 --> 02:26:54,246
- Go ahead.
- They're in custody, Mr. Hoover.

1928
02:26:54,419 --> 02:26:56,512
Good job, Hardesty.

1929
02:26:56,688 --> 02:26:58,451
Thank you, sir.

1930
02:27:00,358 --> 02:27:03,953
- All units, break off surveillance.
- Yes, sir.

1931
02:27:09,968 --> 02:27:12,266
The trial took five months.

1932
02:27:12,437 --> 02:27:16,339
They were convicted,
and the appeal was denied.

1933
02:27:17,108 --> 02:27:20,134
Well, that'll be all for today, gentlemen.
Thank you.

1934
02:27:28,153 --> 02:27:31,987
Mr. Hardesty, from the different cases,
and what you've said about your family...

1935
02:27:32,157 --> 02:27:34,284
...I think you've led a very interesting life.

1936
02:27:34,459 --> 02:27:36,552
Well, I kind of hope so.

1937
02:27:36,728 --> 02:27:38,787
It's the only one I had.

1938
02:27:47,138 --> 02:27:49,766
- Hi, Granddaddy.
- Mike, how are you?

1939
02:27:49,941 --> 02:27:51,738
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

1940
02:27:51,910 --> 02:27:53,502
Now, where did he get that thing?

1941
02:27:53,678 --> 02:27:55,839
Dug it out of some old trunk
or something.

1942
02:27:56,014 --> 02:27:57,481
I guess I'll never understand...

1943
02:27:57,649 --> 02:28:01,312
...how one little family
can collect so much junk.

1944
02:28:58,142 --> 02:29:00,133
