00:06:56.563 --> 00:07:00.294
Oh. my God. Danny.
That‘s fantastic.

162
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.231
Wait.
Pass it around!

163
00:07:02.302 --> 00:07:03.496
[all chattering]

164
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:04.832
Danny‘s
my genius!

165
00:07:04.904 --> 00:07:06.428
The shrimp
is incredible.

166
00:07:07.107 --> 00:07:09.200
Okay. I have a toast.

167
00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:11.934
Toast. To Nick and Anne.

168
00:07:12.078 --> 00:07:13.306
Yeah.

169
00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:16.041
And to this dinner
which is wonderful.

170
00:07:16.583 --> 00:07:18.778
Watch it. watch it.
watch it.

171
00:07:19.018 --> 00:07:22.385
And to the reason
we‘re here tonight.

172
00:07:23.156 --> 00:07:25.386
(Jack)
Not just to
celebrate your anniversary.

173
00:07:25.458 --> 00:07:28.325
but to that deeper thing
that brings us
all close together.

174
00:07:29.829 --> 00:07:31.888
To what bonds us. and--and

175
00:07:32.499 --> 00:07:35.127
makes us huddle against
the cold winds of divorce

176
00:07:35.201 --> 00:07:37.465
that have blown through
the lives of our friends.

177
00:07:37.537 --> 00:07:38.561
Oh. that‘s lovely.

178
00:07:38.638 --> 00:07:40.629
Really nice.
(Danny)
Nice. nice.

179
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.764
Thanks. Jack.

180
00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:42.899
(Anne)
May I say something?

181
00:07:42.976 --> 00:07:44.034
(Jack)
Yes.

182
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.702
I just wanna say
that l<i>...</i>

183
00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:48.373
That was the most
depressing goddamn toast

184
00:07:48.448 --> 00:07:49.938
that I have ever heard
in my life.

185
00:07:50.016 --> 00:07:51.074
[all laughing]

186
00:07:51.151 --> 00:07:52.175
Why? Why?

187
00:07:52.252 --> 00:07:53.549
(Jack)
What‘s wrong with that?

188
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.746
He got to the heart
of it.

189
00:07:54.821 --> 00:07:56.311
He faced it.
He told us his fears.

190
00:07:56.389 --> 00:07:57.856
That‘s why
we‘re here.

191
00:07:57.924 --> 00:07:59.755
That‘s why I’m in analysis.
you know.

192
00:07:59.826 --> 00:08:01.919
It’s not why
I’m eating dinner.

193
00:08:01.995 --> 00:08:03.360
(Danny)
Well. I think he‘s right.

194
00:08:03.429 --> 00:08:04.828
That‘s what
brought us together.

195
00:08:04.898 --> 00:08:07.162
I don‘t get this close
with all my patients.

196
00:08:07.233 --> 00:08:08.894
We didn‘t meet through you.

197
00:08:08.968 --> 00:08:10.196
Sure we did!
Oh!

198
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.464
We did! We did!

199
00:08:11.538 --> 00:08:13.028
Didn‘t I do
some legal work for you?

200
00:08:13.106 --> 00:08:15.734
Then we all got to
know one another.
started going out together.

201
00:08:15.809 --> 00:08:17.834
No. I remember
going over your statement.

202
00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:20.311
We did not meet
through the men at all.

203
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.678
No. They think everything
revolves around them.

204
00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:24.876
Anne is
absolutely right.

205
00:08:25.084 --> 00:08:26.142
You and l.

206
00:08:26.219 --> 00:08:28.687
we met at a women‘s
photographers exhibition

207
00:08:28.755 --> 00:08:31.781
and then Anne and l
met Claudia
at an art gallery.

208
00:08:31.858 --> 00:08:34.588
You didn‘t get at their teeth
until months later.

209
00:08:34.661 --> 00:08:36.458
Uh. we met seven years ago.

210
00:08:36.529 --> 00:08:38.463
It was the third week.
Thank you.

211
00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:40.055
The third week in July.

212
00:08:40.133 --> 00:08:44.502
And my first appointment
with Danny was. uh.
for a filling.

213
00:08:44.771 --> 00:08:47.001
It was. uh. September 8.

214
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.007
[stuttering]

215
00:08:49.075 --> 00:08:50.940
and it was a Wednesday.

216
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:52.500
How can you remember that?

217
00:08:52.579 --> 00:08:54.570
Oh. uh. I remember
things like that

218
00:08:54.647 --> 00:08:57.047
because I feel
they‘re important.

219
00:08:57.383 --> 00:09:00.284
Look. the point is
what brings us together.

220
00:09:00.486 --> 00:09:02.181
Right. That‘s the point.
(Danny)
Right?

221
00:09:02.255 --> 00:09:03.347
(Jack)
That‘s the point.

222
00:09:03.423 --> 00:09:06.654
We owe the depth. breadth
and height of this friendship

223
00:09:06.726 --> 00:09:09.320
to the world‘s
most ancient emotions:

224
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.457
fear and panic.

225
00:09:12.599 --> 00:09:13.793
[all laughing]

226
00:09:13.867 --> 00:09:15.391
Am I right? Am I right?

227
00:09:15.468 --> 00:09:16.833
I love you.
Am I right?

228
00:09:16.903 --> 00:09:18.734
Listen. I spent three hours
buying this

229
00:09:18.805 --> 00:09:20.830
and four hours chopping it
into little pieces.

230
00:09:20.907 --> 00:09:23.068
I’m not just gonna eat it.
I’m gonna make love to it.

231
00:09:23.142 --> 00:09:24.666
You keep talking.
I’ll eat yours.

232

I--I can‘t get
this damn fender
straightened.

237
00:09:36.689 --> 00:09:37.747
I’ll see you down there.

238
00:09:37.824 --> 00:09:39.018
Yeah.

Don‘t get too close.
Watch your foot.

Come on.
I’ll race you.

I’m going fast enough.
I just wanna dry my hair.

246
00:10:05.118 --> 00:10:07.109
Come on. We‘ll see who
gets to the house first.

247
00:10:07.186 --> 00:10:09.416
Let‘s just see
if we can get there.
How about that?

248
00:10:09.489 --> 00:10:10.615
Hey. you want a helmet?

249
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.783
Of course
I want a helmet.

250

Oh. that‘s better.
That‘s nice.

(Jack)
You look great on that thing.

Come on. What do you say?

258
00:10:32.345 --> 00:10:34.438

I don‘t wanna race!

Are you okay?

How. how about Indian food
next time?

277
00:11:38.711 --> 00:11:40.872
We can-- We can make
our own mango chutney.

278
00:11:40.947 --> 00:11:42.574
we can fry a little <i>chapatí.</i>

(Nick)
How about Indonesian?

280
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:45.774
We could do
a whole rice table.

Oh. yeah.
That will be great.

It’s 1 :00.

we can do it. huh?

has arthritis.

Of course you make
a better sauce than her.

To be with friends

323

this is what it is
to be happy.

will you?

I’m one of
the most successful
estate planners in New York.

But that‘s nothing
compared to this.

I wish that you would relax.

I’m not on
the Million Dollar Roundtable?

Oh. Do you know
what you get

339
00:13:42.235 --> 00:13:44.135
for being in
the Million Dollar Roundtable?

340

What?
What?

341
00:13:45.371 --> 00:13:47.430
A plastic statue
and a weekend.

I don‘t want
this afternoon to disappear

without something
to remember it by.

Some memorial of our

You know.

391
00:16:09.482 --> 00:16:12.383
I think we‘re close enough to
say anything to each other.

Really. Anything.

Can you honestly say
you‘re really happy?

Yeah. but not
every minute.

It comes in waves.

400
00:16:46.118 --> 00:16:47.278
At times you hit lows

401
00:16:47.353 --> 00:16:49.651
and you can‘t stand things
about each other.

402
00:16:50.289 --> 00:16:53.122
Like the way
her teeth click
when she eats.

The way I smell my sweatshirt
before I put it on.

Sometimes we drive
each other crazy.

00:16:59.298 --> 00:17:01.289
And then there are times

406
00:17:01.934 --> 00:17:05.131
we go through a period
like the one we‘re in now.

407

It comes over us

puppy love.

I can‘t wait to see her.

410
00:17:11.544 --> 00:17:14.206
And then when I’m with her
my heart beats faster.

411
00:17:16.182 --> 00:17:18.116
I’d expect it
with somebody
who‘s a stranger.

00:17:18.184 --> 00:17:20.448
but not somebody
I’ve spent
half my life with.

It’s wonderful.

I wish I could feel that.

Oh. you will.
It‘ll come back.
Just give it time.

No. I’ve never felt it.

married Anne.

I was crazy as a kid.

420
00:17:44.377 --> 00:17:47.505

she‘d be some kind of
stability for me.

Well.
she certainly is stable.

423
00:17:54.653 --> 00:17:56.780
I mean. she‘s a decent woman.
she‘s a good mother

424
00:17:56.856 --> 00:17:59.051
but she doesn‘t
do anything.

425

Doesn‘t think anything.

426

I’ve never heard
one stimulating idea

427

428

When she took up photography.

429
00:18:08.934 --> 00:18:11.300
I thought. finally
she‘s gonna do something.

430
00:18:12.171 --> 00:18:15.072

she‘s inert.

So work on it with her.
Talk to her about it.

She gets obsessed with that.

She‘ll pace up and down
all day long

talk about her work.

Fine. You know what
she talks about?

Vegetables.

we talked about zucchini.

Then for a year.
green peppers.

482
00:20:41.587 --> 00:20:44.613
This is the hardest thing
I’ve ever gone through
in my life.

483
00:20:47.993 --> 00:20:49.824
All right. I’m sorry.

484
00:20:55.501 --> 00:20:58.527
Oh. God.
Nick. this is awful. Jesus.

485
00:21:09.582 --> 00:21:11.277
Come on. let‘s go.

486
00:21:11.617 --> 00:21:13.517
[all chattering]

487
00:21:15.054 --> 00:21:16.487
Want some more of these?

488
00:21:16.555 --> 00:21:18.523
Oh. yes. Thank you.
Good. good.

489
00:21:20.359 --> 00:21:23.328
You know.
beans are very much
misunderstood.

490
00:21:23.395 --> 00:21:26.091
They have a complex set
of amino acids.

491
00:21:26.899 --> 00:21:29.026
lf you eat beans
together with rice.

492
00:21:29.101 --> 00:21:30.625
you never have to
eat meat.

493
00:21:30.703 --> 00:21:32.898
Danny loves to
talk about beans.

494
00:21:32.972 --> 00:21:35.065
Go ahead. sweetheart.
Talk.

495
00:21:35.474 --> 00:21:37.999
It’s the combination
that counts.
Here. you want some of these?

496
00:21:38.077 --> 00:21:39.101
(Nick)
Yeah. I do.

497
00:21:39.178 --> 00:21:40.907
You know. I’ve been
thinking about that.

498
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.140
(Jack)
About what?

499
00:21:42.214 --> 00:21:44.182
Photographing vegetables

[stammers]

502
00:21:50.756 --> 00:21:52.223
I’m not sure yet.

503
00:21:54.727 --> 00:21:57.389
(Kate)
Hey. I did some research
on sailboats for the summer.

504
00:21:57.463 --> 00:21:58.521
(Danny)
That‘s great.

505
00:21:58.597 --> 00:21:59.655
Already?

506
00:21:59.732 --> 00:22:01.962
We only talked about it
a couple of days ago.

507
00:22:02.034 --> 00:22:04.298
I got it in here someplace.
Here it is.

508
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:05.769
Nick.
you ought to check this out.

509
00:22:05.838 --> 00:22:07.066
You‘re the sailor
in the group.

510
00:22:07.139 --> 00:22:08.834
(Danny)
Where did you get
all this stuff?

511
00:22:08.907 --> 00:22:10.238
Called a couple
of boat brokers.

512
00:22:10.309 --> 00:22:11.674
No kidding.
(Jack)
Let me see one.

513
00:22:11.744 --> 00:22:14.042
We can rent one in St. Thomas
and sail around the islands

514
00:22:14.113 --> 00:22:16.308
and fly home. The whole thing
will take two weeks.

515
00:22:16.382 --> 00:22:18.373
This woman‘s fantastic.

516
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.077
Nick. isn‘t this beautiful?

517
00:22:20.152 --> 00:22:21.312
What a boat.

518
00:22:21.387 --> 00:22:22.786
Oh. is that the galley?

519
00:22:22.855 --> 00:22:23.913
Yes.

520
00:22:23.989 --> 00:22:25.115
And you know what?

521
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.351
I think it looks<i>...</i>
It looks a little small to me.

00:22:27.426 --> 00:22:28.484
(Claudia)
Gorgeous.

523
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.584
(Danny)
Yeah. right.

524
00:22:29.662 --> 00:22:31.562
Oh. l--I think
we‘ll manage very well.

525
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:32.619
don‘t you?

526
00:22:32.698 --> 00:22:35.030
Oh. I think it‘s beautiful.

527
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.624
Oh. look at that.

Can‘t you sleep?

532

Nick is getting
a divorce.

533
00:23:14.073 --> 00:23:15.734
How do you know?

534
00:23:16.942 --> 00:23:19.410
He told me yesterday when
we were getting firewood.

535
00:23:21.847 --> 00:23:22.973
Jeez.

536
00:23:24.216 --> 00:23:26.184
Is there somebody else?

537
00:23:27.453 --> 00:23:29.580
He says
there isn‘t anybody.

538
00:23:31.056 --> 00:23:33.957
Why does he have to leave her?
Why can‘t they fight it out?

[thunder rumbling]

[seagulls cawing]

Oh. god. It’s
gorgeous down there.

545
00:25:09.655 --> 00:25:11.555
Yeah?
There‘s this
enormous turtle.

546
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:13.351
You didn‘t try to ride him.
did you?

547
00:25:13.425 --> 00:25:16.155
Ride a turtle that big?
Are you kidding?

548
00:25:16.795 --> 00:25:18.456
I was thinking of it.
but I got scared.

549

Oh. Good morning.

Hey. could you
sleep last night?

Not very well.
What is it with them?

It was great. Yeah.

Wasn‘t it peaceful

like that?

Oh. yeah. did you listen
to the radio yet?

Yeah.
it‘s supposed to be clear.

After breakfast.
should we head for St. Croix?

599
00:27:03.001 --> 00:27:05.902
Wait a minute.

we‘re gonna go anywhere

unless we can get
the anchor up.

Well. we‘ll just pull it up.
Pull it up?

606
00:27:16.081 --> 00:27:18.049
Isn‘t that why
we had to stay here
last night.

607
00:27:18.116 --> 00:27:20.175
because we couldn‘t
pull the anchor up?

608
00:27:20.252 --> 00:27:23.779
Nah. if the three of us
give it a yank. it‘ll come up.
Come on.

your anchor for a while.

out of the water.

He can sail.
He knows how to choose wines.

that he‘s just about

(Ginny)
Yeah.

00:27:47.045 --> 00:27:50.208
He‘s a life member in
the Million Dollar Roundtable.

621
00:27:50.282 --> 00:27:52.341
I hear they send you
to Puerto Rico for that.

622
00:27:52.417 --> 00:27:54.248
Oh. yeah.
He goes all over the place.

624
00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.888
We met on my flight to L.A.

625
00:27:58.123 --> 00:28:01.581
I sat with him for an hour
after the dinner service
and<i>...</i>

626
00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.423
God. I had just
never met anybody

627
00:28:03.495 --> 00:28:06.055
who knew so much about
actuarial tables.

628
00:28:06.131 --> 00:28:07.428
He‘s a charmer.

629

[laughs]
Yeah.

630
00:28:11.036 --> 00:28:13.197

Has he been sailing long?

No.

(Ginny)
Well. how about Jack?

634
00:28:20.345 --> 00:28:23.439
Jack saw

when he was 12.

One. two. heave ho!

636
00:28:26.351 --> 00:28:28.216
Come on.
We‘re not gonna make it.

637
00:28:28.286 --> 00:28:30.049
(Jack)
This is like
pulling a building.

638
00:28:30.122 --> 00:28:32.215
(Jack)
Okay. Come on.
Danny. watch your foot.

639
00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:33.484
Watch out. Watch out.

00:34:19.771 --> 00:34:21.932
I just can‘t believe
that he would bring her

800
00:34:22.006 --> 00:34:23.667
on the boat with us.

801
00:34:25.043 --> 00:34:26.840
Every time
I make a suggestion.

802
00:34:26.911 --> 00:34:29.778
every time I say something
they‘re ignorant of.

803
00:34:29.848 --> 00:34:31.782
do you see the way
they look at each other?

804
00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:33.647
They discuss me
behind my back.

805
00:34:33.718 --> 00:34:36.346
I mean. she walks around
with that hanky on her hips

806
00:34:36.421 --> 00:34:38.821
that‘s supposed to be
a bathing suit.

807
00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:40.380
Oh. God.

808
00:34:40.458 --> 00:34:42.926
I get so depressed
every time I look at her.

809
00:34:44.362 --> 00:34:47.456
These people are vicious.
Vicious and ill.

810
00:34:47.565 --> 00:34:49.692
[Nick and Ginny laughing]

811

[Ginny moaning]

812
00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:57.904
I don‘t believe it.
They‘re at it again.

813
00:34:58.376 --> 00:35:00.970
[Nick and Ginny moaning]

814
00:35:04.015 --> 00:35:05.039
They never stop.

815
00:35:05.116 --> 00:35:07.584
Those two
are gonna kill themselves.

816

[Ginny moaning]

820
00:35:26.571 --> 00:35:28.539
They‘re driving me crazy.

821
00:35:31.409 --> 00:35:33.434
Talk about something else.

822
00:35:33.978 --> 00:35:36.071
Something serious
and complex.

823
00:35:36.147 --> 00:35:37.944
We won‘t even<i>...</i>
We won‘t even notice it.

824
00:35:38.016 --> 00:35:39.005
All right. Okay.

825
00:35:39.083 --> 00:35:40.414
Something serious.
Okay. go ahead.

826
00:35:40.485 --> 00:35:42.510
[Ginny moaning]
Something serious and complex.

827
00:35:42.587 --> 00:35:44.248
Tell me about
the Simmons suit.

828
00:35:44.322 --> 00:35:45.550
The. uh. Simmons suit.

829
00:35:45.623 --> 00:35:46.715
The Simmons suit.

830
00:35:46.791 --> 00:35:47.951
Yeah. Okay.

831
00:35:48.026 --> 00:35:50.221
[Nick and Ginny moaning]

832
00:35:50.462 --> 00:35:52.089
The Simmons suit.

833
00:35:52.764 --> 00:35:55.062
Well. it all depends
how the judge interprets

834
00:35:55.133 --> 00:35:56.532
[both continue moaning]
the. uh.

835
00:35:56.601 --> 00:35:58.501

[both moaning]

843
00:36:20.892 --> 00:36:22.416
Part of the problem
with inflation

844
00:36:22.494 --> 00:36:23.518
[both continue moaning]

845
00:36:23.595 --> 00:36:25.563
is that the production
of goods and services

846
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:27.063
[Nick moaning]
per man hour of work

847
00:36:27.131 --> 00:36:29.065
is falling at a rate
of three percent a year.

848
00:36:29.133 --> 00:36:30.760
What is she doing to him?

849
00:36:31.269 --> 00:36:32.896
[Nick moaning]
You‘re not listening.

850
00:36:32.971 --> 00:36:34.563
Now. will you just listen?

851
00:36:34.639 --> 00:36:36.732
lf productivity falls
three percent.

852
00:36:36.808 --> 00:36:38.935
then wages
have to fall three percent.

853
00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:40.475
Are you listening?

854
00:36:40.545 --> 00:36:41.944
[laughing]

855
00:36:43.248 --> 00:36:45.739
Then the cost
of production rises.

856
00:36:45.884 --> 00:36:47.351

[Nick moaning]

860
00:37:07.071 --> 00:37:08.060
So--

861
00:37:08.139 --> 00:37:09.163
(Nick)
Again.

862
00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.969
Oh. no. not again!

I can‘t take anymore of this.

[both sigh]

869
00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:48.237
Do you want
some breakfast?

870
00:37:48.313 --> 00:37:52.113
I’m too sleepy to eat.
Those people are killing me.

871
00:37:52.884 --> 00:37:55.978
I’m gonna make some coffee
and see if I can wake up.

872
00:37:56.054 --> 00:37:59.251
Maybe if I lie in the sun
I can go back to sleep.

Down here. Quick.

Oh. my God.

882
00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.851
(Danny)
Is the coffee ready?

883
00:38:30.922 --> 00:38:33.390
I can‘t get my eyes open
this morning.

884
00:38:33.458 --> 00:38:35.858
Maybe this‘ll get
your eyes open.

885
00:38:35.927 --> 00:38:37.588
[Ginny laughing]

886
00:38:38.262 --> 00:38:41.288
(Danny)
They‘re swimming already?
Where do they get the energy?

887
00:38:41.366 --> 00:38:42.526
Keep looking at them.

888
00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.693
What am I supposed
to see?

889
00:38:47.038 --> 00:38:48.369
A-ha.

890
00:38:52.977 --> 00:38:55.707

What‘s the matter?
Is everybody sick?

You know.
when you really
think about it.

896
00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:11.888
there isn‘t
anything sexual about it.

897
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:13.754
It’s natural.

898
00:39:14.132 --> 00:39:15.997
People go to
their doctor‘s offices.

899
00:39:16.067 --> 00:39:18.228
they take off
their clothes.

900
00:39:18.503 --> 00:39:19.902
it doesn‘t
mean a thing.

901
00:39:20.371 --> 00:39:23.204
Meanwhile. he hasn‘t
taken his eyes off her
for a second.

902

I almost got you.

Hi.
Hi.

906
00:39:35.286 --> 00:39:36.412
Oh. they‘re
swimming over.

907
00:39:36.487 --> 00:39:37.715
Oh. Jesus.
Oh. Lord.

908
00:39:37.789 --> 00:39:39.518
Just act casual.

909
00:39:39.657 --> 00:39:41.124
What you mean.
like you?

910
00:39:41.592 --> 00:39:42.752
I’m gonna
make breakfast.

911
00:39:42.827 --> 00:39:44.522
I don‘t wanna look
at my friends naked.

912
00:39:44.595 --> 00:39:46.756
It makes it hard
to have dinner
with them later.

913
00:39:46.831 --> 00:39:48.822
Yeah. I’m gonna go
sit in the shade.

914
00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:51.664
And I think. maybe.
I’ll read a book.

915
00:39:55.206 --> 00:39:57.470
Okay. Danny.
we‘ve all got something to do.

916
00:39:57.542 --> 00:39:59.407
What‘s everybody
getting so crazy about?

917
00:39:59.477 --> 00:40:00.910
You can‘t see anything.

918
00:40:00.978 --> 00:40:02.570
Then what are you
standing there for?

919
00:40:02.647 --> 00:40:05.172
He‘s hoping she‘ll turn over
and do the backstroke.

920
00:40:05.249 --> 00:40:07.717
I was just enjoying
their playfulness.

921
00:40:08.786 --> 00:40:10.378
They‘re like
a couple of porpoises.

922
00:40:10.455 --> 00:40:13.288
It’s a pure animal pleasure
of having fun. that‘s all.

923
00:40:13.357 --> 00:40:16.326
Danny. will you.
for Christ‘s sake. sit down?

924
00:40:20.665 --> 00:40:22.155
What‘s the matter
with this woman?

925
00:40:22.233 --> 00:40:23.757
[laughs]
Huh! Shit.

926
00:40:32.143 --> 00:40:34.168
Hold it.
Okay. hold it there.

927
00:40:34.245 --> 00:40:36.475
Now give me a hand
with this.

928
00:40:37.181 --> 00:40:38.910
Okay. Here we go.

929
00:40:40.518 --> 00:40:44.147

Okay. Danny. start the winch.
Crank it up.

That‘s it.

933
00:40:50.895 --> 00:40:53.022
Kate. make sure
that tail line is taut.

934
00:40:53.097 --> 00:40:56.032
All right. come on.
keep going. Heave!

935

Keep cranking. Keep cranking.

All right. Ginny.

937
00:41:01.372 --> 00:41:03.306
I wanna put
a little more pressure on it.

938

Why do we love

Because it represents

What are we cramped up
in here for?

1120
00:50:15.726 --> 00:50:17.353
We could‘ve used
their station wagon.

1121
00:50:17.428 --> 00:50:19.589
A station wagon is a car.

1122
00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:22.455
A Mercedes
is a thoroughbred.

1123
00:50:22.866 --> 00:50:23.924
Every so often.

1124
00:50:24.001 --> 00:50:26.367
it needs to be taken
on the open road
and challenged.

1125
00:50:26.437 --> 00:50:27.927
Want some?
Yeah. I’d love a bite.

1126
00:50:28.005 --> 00:50:29.131
Don‘t eat!
What?

1127
00:50:29.206 --> 00:50:30.503
Don‘t eat!
Why?

1128
00:50:30.574 --> 00:50:32.132
The crumbs go down
in the upholstery.

1129
00:50:32.209 --> 00:50:33.574
You‘ll never get it out.

1130
00:50:33.644 --> 00:50:36.010
The car will look like
the bottom of a bird cage.

1131
00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:37.274
Isn‘t that crazy?

1132
00:50:37.348 --> 00:50:38.508
I’m starving.

1133
00:50:38.582 --> 00:50:39.844
One loaf of French bread

1134
00:50:39.917 --> 00:50:42.442
and the resale value
goes down $500.

1135
00:50:42.519 --> 00:50:45.716
(Danny)
You wanna eat a $500 sandwich.
it‘s up to you.

1136
00:50:45.956 --> 00:50:48.186
How about if
I just eat the insides for $1?

1137
00:50:48.258 --> 00:50:49.520
[tires screeching]

1138
00:50:50.627 --> 00:50:52.356

00:50:53.797 --> 00:50:55.958

[all groaning]

1142
00:51:05.576 --> 00:51:06.634
(Nick)
Can you make it?

1143
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:08.405
(Kate)
Claudia.
once we find our kids.

1144
00:51:08.479 --> 00:51:10.003
why don‘t you and Danny
drop us off?

1145
00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.843
Then you can go see Mike
at Wesley.

1146
00:51:11.915 --> 00:51:13.906
We‘ll see him tomorrow.
It’s Saturday night.

1147
00:51:13.984 --> 00:51:15.815
He‘s probably out
trying to get laid.

1148
00:51:15.886 --> 00:51:19.378
What makes you think
your son‘s always doing
something sexual?

1149
00:51:19.456 --> 00:51:21.185
Please. I’m Italian.

1150
00:51:21.258 --> 00:51:22.623
Hi! There she is!

1151
00:51:22.693 --> 00:51:23.785
[all screeching]

1152
00:51:23.861 --> 00:51:25.260
Bethie!

1153
00:51:25.329 --> 00:51:26.728
Hi. guys.

1154
00:51:26.797 --> 00:51:28.094
Hi!

1155
00:51:29.032 --> 00:51:30.499
(Kate)
God. you look marvelous.

1156
00:51:30.567 --> 00:51:31.659
(Beth)
Hi!

1157
00:51:31.735 --> 00:51:32.895
Hello. honey.
Hi.

1158
00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:34.335
Hello.
Hi.

1159
00:51:34.738 --> 00:51:36.296
(Beth)
Lisa‘s down there
somewhere.

1160
00:51:36.373 --> 00:51:37.431
Where?

1161
00:51:37.508 --> 00:51:39.066
Down there.
Come on. I’ll show you.

1162
00:51:39.143 --> 00:51:41.202
Guess what?
I got an ‘‘A‘‘ in History.

1163
00:51:41.278 --> 00:51:42.302
[Kate and Jack exclaiming]

1164
00:51:42.379 --> 00:51:44.745
And this teacher
is such a jerk.
you wouldn‘t believe it.

1165
00:51:44.815 --> 00:51:46.806
He wouldn‘t even tell us
what to write about.

1166
00:51:46.884 --> 00:51:48.875
I had to figure
the whole thing out by myself.

1167
00:51:48.952 --> 00:51:51.477
You don‘t think
he was trying to get you
to think for yourself?

1168
00:51:51.555 --> 00:51:53.216
No. Mom. no.
This guy is really a jerk.

1169
00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:56.191
lf the jerks had
their own country.
this guy would be president.

1170
00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:57.488
[both laughing]

1171
00:51:58.162 --> 00:51:59.629
There she is.
Lisa! Lis!

1172
00:51:59.696 --> 00:52:01.493
I’ll--I’ll go get her.
Hold on. will you?

1173
00:52:01.565 --> 00:52:02.589
Wait right there.

1174
00:52:02.666 --> 00:52:03.633
Okay.

1175
00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:05.258
Oh. God.
she‘s wonderful.

1176
00:52:05.335 --> 00:52:07.803
(Danny)
That kid sure takes
a real bite out of life.

1177
00:52:09.373 --> 00:52:10.635
Hi ya. babe.

1178
00:52:10.707 --> 00:52:11.833
(Lisa)
Hi. Dad.

1179
00:52:11.909 --> 00:52:14.036
Hi. You look great.

1180
00:52:14.845 --> 00:52:15.937
(Kate)
Hi. Lisa.

1181
00:52:16.013 --> 00:52:17.105
Hi.

1182
00:52:17.181 --> 00:52:18.808
Hi. Lisa.
Hi.

1183
00:52:18.882 --> 00:52:19.974
It’s good to
see you again.

1184
00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:21.517
Hi. Lisa.
Hi.

1185
00:52:22.152 --> 00:52:23.380
(Nick)
Doesn‘t she look good?

1186
00:52:23.454 --> 00:52:25.217
(Jack)
Oh. you look terrific.
Just great.

1187
00:52:25.289 --> 00:52:26.551
Thanks.

1188
00:52:27.624 --> 00:52:29.216
Oh.
I have a present for you.

1189
00:52:29.293 --> 00:52:30.419
(Nick)
Right.

1190
00:52:30.494 --> 00:52:32.052
Yeah.
I’ll--I’ll go get it. Okay?

1191
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:35.721
So.
you‘re getting enough sleep.
and food and everything?

1192
00:52:35.799 --> 00:52:36.925
You look just great.

1193
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.092
Thanks.

1194
00:52:38.302 --> 00:52:39.599
Can you have
lunch with us now?

1195
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:41.604
We‘re gonna have
lunch at the Inn. okay?

1196
00:52:41.672 --> 00:52:43.503
Sure.
You got a ride
over there. right?

1197
00:52:43.574 --> 00:52:45.132
Yeah. I’m going
with Beth in her car.

1198
00:52:45.209 --> 00:52:46.938
You know the way?
Yeah. yeah. of course.

1199
00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:49.979
There‘s a return slip.
if it‘s the wrong
size or anything.

1200
00:52:50.047 --> 00:52:51.139
Thank you.

1201
00:52:51.215 --> 00:52:52.239
See you later. Lisa.

1202
00:52:52.316 --> 00:52:54.375
Okay. we‘ll see you later.
Bye-bye.

1203
00:52:54.451 --> 00:52:55.611
(Claudia)
See you later. girls.

1204
00:52:55.686 --> 00:52:57.085
(Danny)
Bye-bye.

1205
00:52:57.488 --> 00:52:59.115
Oh. boy.
does she look great.

1206
00:52:59.189 --> 00:53:01.282
You don‘t think she looked
a little depressed?

1207
00:53:01.358 --> 00:53:02.347
Who? You mean Lisa?

1208
00:53:02.426 --> 00:53:03.393
Yeah. Lisa.

1209
00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:05.394
No. no. no. no.
She has a slow metabolism.

1210
00:53:05.462 --> 00:53:07.327
That‘s up. She‘s up today.

1211
00:53:07.898 --> 00:53:09.923
Maybe you should
have a talk with her.

1212
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.399
What‘s the matter
with you people?

1213
00:53:11.468 --> 00:53:13.095
I tell you.
the kid is a survivor.

1214
00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:15.001
Just a little talk.

1215
00:53:15.138 --> 00:53:16.969
It‘ll make her
feel so much better.

1216
00:53:17.808 --> 00:53:19.173
[chuckles]

1217
00:53:19.243 --> 00:53:20.437
Okay.

1218
00:53:36.059 --> 00:53:37.754
(Kate)
Do you lock it now or what?

1219
00:53:37.828 --> 00:53:39.659
You wanna hang
onto your purse?
No.

1220
00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:41.254
Got your purse.

1221
00:53:41.365 --> 00:53:43.629
[everyone chattering]

1222
00:53:47.237 --> 00:53:48.670
This is<i>...</i>

1223
00:53:49.339 --> 00:53:51.307
Did you know Anne
is here this weekend?

1224
00:53:51.375 --> 00:53:53.240
Anne is here?
Oh. no.

1225
00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:54.743
Are you sure?
Beth told me.

1226
00:53:54.811 --> 00:53:56.472
My God.
how did that happen?

1227
00:53:56.547 --> 00:53:57.639
[birds chirping]

1228
00:53:57.714 --> 00:53:59.579
Anne‘s grown up.
She can take it.

1229
00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:01.550
What makes you think
we can?

1230
00:54:01.618 --> 00:54:03.347
Did you know
she was coming?

1231
00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.785
When I talked to her
Tuesday.

1232
00:54:04.855 --> 00:54:06.823
she said she was gonna
work it out with Nick.

1233
00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:09.085
I called her when we said
we were coming up here

1234
00:54:09.159 --> 00:54:10.421
just so this
wouldn‘t happen.

1235
00:54:10.494 --> 00:54:11.586
Well. I don‘t understand.

1236
00:54:11.662 --> 00:54:13.857
Nick. you didn‘t tell her
you were coming with Ginny

1237
00:54:13.931 --> 00:54:14.863
and she didn‘t tell you?

1238
00:54:14.932 --> 00:54:17.833
I don‘t know.
She might have mentioned
she was thinking of it.

1239
00:54:17.901 --> 00:54:20.836
She never does
what she says she‘s gonna do.
She‘s unreliable.

1240
00:54:20.904 --> 00:54:22.462
I don‘t listen to
her half the time.

1241
00:54:22.539 --> 00:54:24.564
(Kate)
That might be
a small problem right there.

1242
00:54:24.641 --> 00:54:26.609
You know. I don‘t
wanna talk her down

1243
00:54:26.677 --> 00:54:28.542
but she is
unreliable.

1244
00:54:28.612 --> 00:54:30.443
I mean.
Nick has made
three appointments

1245
00:54:30.514 --> 00:54:32.175
to meet her down
at his lawyer‘s office

1246
00:54:32.249 --> 00:54:33.409
and she‘s never
shown up.

1247
00:54:33.483 --> 00:54:34.745
She hasn‘t
even called.

1248
00:54:34.818 --> 00:54:36.410
Now. wait a minute.

1249
00:54:36.486 --> 00:54:39.546
No offense. Ginny.
but 21 years ago
Nick said he would be there

1250
00:54:39.623 --> 00:54:43.081
on the other side of
the bed every morning
and for the last six months

1251
00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.355
he hasn‘t kept his
appointment. either!

1252
00:54:46.363 --> 00:54:47.990
Okay. uh. look--look.
let‘s calm down.

1253
00:54:48.065 --> 00:54:50.590
It’s not all that bad.
It’s just
a little embarrassing.

1254
00:54:50.667 --> 00:54:52.396
I don‘t see what
the big problem is.

1255
00:54:52.469 --> 00:54:54.130
We‘re all adults.

1256
00:54:54.805 --> 00:54:56.602
We‘ll just say ‘‘Hello.‘‘
and. uh<i>...</i>

1257
00:54:56.673 --> 00:54:58.732
Have a nervous
breakdown.

1258
00:55:00.377 --> 00:55:02.811
Ginny. I’m sorry.

1259
00:55:03.246 --> 00:55:06.443
The--the-- This--
there is a lot of strain
on the situation

1260
00:55:06.516 --> 00:55:07.881
and I get
passionate sometimes.

1261
00:55:07.951 --> 00:55:09.009
That‘s okay.

1262
00:55:09.086 --> 00:55:12.112
[sniffling]
I know you‘re just trying
to be fair to everybody.

1263
00:55:13.156 --> 00:55:15.784
You‘re the one
I wanted to make cry.

1264
00:55:18.028 --> 00:55:20.189
(Danny)
Why do you have to
open up your mouth again?

1265
00:55:20.263 --> 00:55:22.322
Danny. it‘s over
and done with. please.
Come on.

1266
00:55:22.399 --> 00:55:24.128
Let‘s have a nice
quiet time. just once.

1267
00:55:24.201 --> 00:55:26.601
We‘re gonna have<i>...</i>
All right.
let‘s get a move on.

1268
00:55:26.837 --> 00:55:29.237
Shh.
Please. not now.

1269
00:55:30.207 --> 00:55:31.799
Hey. you okay?
Yeah.

1270
00:55:31.875 --> 00:55:33.672
You sure?
I’m okay.

1271
00:55:35.679 --> 00:55:38.079
Do you have a reservation
for Callan. please?

1272
00:55:38.148 --> 00:55:39.979
You‘re all registered.
Mr. Callan.

1273
00:55:41.251 --> 00:55:42.718
I’m all registered?

1274
00:55:42.786 --> 00:55:44.845
Mrs. Callan checked
in a few minutes ago.

1275
00:55:46.156 --> 00:55:47.783
[people chattering]

1276
00:55:49.926 --> 00:55:51.154
Everything
all right?

1277
00:55:51.228 --> 00:55:52.718
Oh. yeah.
everything‘s terrific.

1278
00:55:52.796 --> 00:55:53.956
Do we have
our rooms?

1279
00:55:54.031 --> 00:55:55.020
Wait a minute.

1280
00:55:55.098 --> 00:55:57.896
Uh. could I see you over here
for a minute. please?

1281
00:55:57.968 --> 00:56:00.061
Could I see you over here
for a minute. please?

1282
00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:01.462
What‘s the matter?

1283
00:56:03.073 --> 00:56:04.938
[whispers]
As far as I can make out.

1284
00:56:05.008 --> 00:56:07.374
Anne has just
checked into our room.

1285
00:56:07.811 --> 00:56:09.745
Oh. no. I knew it.
Oh. my God.

1286
00:56:10.847 --> 00:56:12.678
Look. we can just
go someplace else.

1287
00:56:12.749 --> 00:56:14.046
(Kate)
On Parents‘ Weekend.

1288
00:56:14.117 --> 00:56:16.244
everything‘s booked
within 50 miles of here.

1289
00:56:16.319 --> 00:56:18.219
(Ginny)
Well. then I’ll sleep
in the car.

1290
00:56:18.288 --> 00:56:20.518
I could sit up
all night in the diner.

1291
00:56:21.091 --> 00:56:24.356
[sighs]
Maybe the earth will just
open up and swallow me.

1292
00:56:26.263 --> 00:56:27.730
Hi. everybody.

1293
00:56:27.798 --> 00:56:28.730
Hi.

1294
00:56:28.799 --> 00:56:31.029
(all)
Hi.

1295
00:56:31.301 --> 00:56:32.359
(Kate)
Hi. How are you?

1296
00:56:32.436 --> 00:56:33.460
(Anne)
I’m fine.

1297
00:56:34.204 --> 00:56:35.671
Oh. that‘s a nice kiss.

1298
00:56:35.739 --> 00:56:37.536
This is wonderful.

1299
00:56:38.575 --> 00:56:39.701
You look gorgeous.

1300
00:56:39.776 --> 00:56:40.868
Thank you.

1301
00:56:41.411 --> 00:56:43.345
It’s great
to see you.

1302
00:56:44.147 --> 00:56:45.944
Uh. hi.

1303
00:56:48.151 --> 00:56:49.948
[Anne laughing]

1304
00:56:52.322 --> 00:56:54.051
Did you see Lisa?
No. I haven‘t yet.

1305
00:56:54.124 --> 00:56:56.058
Oh. she looks terrific.
She does?

1306
00:56:56.126 --> 00:56:58.151
Oh. yeah.
Oh. good. I miss her.

1307
00:57:02.933 --> 00:57:04.230
Hi. I’m Ginny.

1308
00:57:04.301 --> 00:57:05.928
Oh. this is Ginny Newley.

1309
00:57:06.503 --> 00:57:08.903
How do you do? l--
We‘ve spoken on the phone.
I believe.

1310
00:57:08.972 --> 00:57:10.701
Yes. l--I think
we have.

1311
00:57:12.609 --> 00:57:14.543
Okay. I got that
taken care of.

1312
00:57:16.213 --> 00:57:17.771
Oh. hi. Anne. how are you?

1313
00:57:17.848 --> 00:57:20.373
Fine. Nick. I’m fine.
How are you?

1314
00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:21.815
I’m fine.

1315
00:57:25.055 --> 00:57:26.682
Well. now that we all
know we‘re fine.

1316
00:57:26.757 --> 00:57:28.782
is there anything else
we ought to talk about?

1317
00:57:28.859 --> 00:57:32.693
Jack. don‘t. uh. don‘t try to
get to the heart of things.

1318
00:57:32.763 --> 00:57:34.663
just let it lay there.

1319
00:57:35.132 --> 00:57:37.259
Why are we all pretending
we‘re not embarrassed?

1320
00:57:37.334 --> 00:57:39.268
Why don‘t we just
say how we feel?

1321
00:57:39.336 --> 00:57:42.794
I feel. uh. like I wish you
would just sort of shut up.

1322
00:57:45.842 --> 00:57:47.104
Okay.

1323
00:57:47.177 --> 00:57:48.804
Lisa‘s on her way
over here.

1324
00:57:48.879 --> 00:57:50.471
I’m gonna have
lunch with her. okay?

1325
00:57:50.547 --> 00:57:53.675
Okay.
I’ll--I’ll have
dinner with her.

1326
00:57:54.117 --> 00:57:55.049
Fine.

1327
00:57:55.118 --> 00:57:56.050
Fine.

1328
00:57:56.753 --> 00:57:58.550
More fine. good.
That‘s great.

1329
00:57:59.456 --> 00:58:00.548
Hmm.

1330
00:58:01.224 --> 00:58:04.193
Listen. it‘s lovely to
see you all. It really is.

1331
00:58:04.761 --> 00:58:05.853
Okay. goodbye.

1332
00:58:05.929 --> 00:58:07.760
Talk to you later. honey.
Take care.

1333
00:58:07.831 --> 00:58:09.162
It was very nice
to meet you.

1334
00:58:09.466 --> 00:58:11.331
Of course.
Thank you. Miss Newley.

1335
00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:19.074
See. what was
wrong with that?

1336
00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:21.609
Claudia. come on.

1337
00:58:21.678 --> 00:58:23.646
Do you have my room?
Dr. Zimmer?

1338
00:58:23.713 --> 00:58:26.273
There won‘t be any more
Zimmers coming in. will there?

1339
00:58:26.349 --> 00:58:27.976
Better not be.

1340
00:58:29.219 --> 00:58:31.813
Anne? Hold on.
Wait a second. huh?

1341
00:58:32.022 --> 00:58:33.011
Anne.

1342
00:58:34.224 --> 00:58:37.057
God. that must‘ve been
murder for you in there.

1343
00:58:37.127 --> 00:58:38.321
I’ll get used to it.

1344
00:58:38.395 --> 00:58:41.057
Shall we talk?
I have a feeling
we should talk.

1345
00:58:41.665 --> 00:58:44.031
[women laughing]
Well. uh<i>...</i>

1346
00:58:47.904 --> 00:58:50.429
Actually I have the feeling

1347
00:58:50.507 --> 00:58:52.498
that. um.
you‘re all deserting me.

1348
00:58:52.576 --> 00:58:53.600
Deserting you?

1349
00:58:53.677 --> 00:58:54.701
Yes.

1350
00:58:55.345 --> 00:58:58.075
You had that. uh. party
on Labor Day

1351
00:58:58.548 --> 00:59:00.675
and you asked
Nick but not me.

1352
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:03.218
Anne! That‘s because
he was with her.

1353
00:59:03.286 --> 00:59:05.982
We couldn‘t invite you both
to the same party.

1354
00:59:06.056 --> 00:59:07.455
We would‘ve been
nervous wrecks.

1355
00:59:07.524 --> 00:59:09.219
Anne. we love you.

1356
00:59:09.826 --> 00:59:12.454
Uh. look. next week why
don‘t we have dinner?

1357
00:59:12.529 --> 00:59:14.429
We‘ll--we‘ll go see
a movie. Huh?

1358
00:59:14.865 --> 00:59:16.560
Good. I would like that.

1359
00:59:16.633 --> 00:59:18.328
You know.
you‘re right. it‘s true.

1360
00:59:18.435 --> 00:59:20.335
We‘ve talked to you
on the phone a few times

1361
00:59:20.403 --> 00:59:22.337
but in the last
couple of months.

1362
00:59:22.405 --> 00:59:24.703
we have let you
drift out of our lives.

1363
00:59:25.675 --> 00:59:27.199
Has it been really tough?

1364
00:59:29.679 --> 00:59:30.976
Not bad.

1365
00:59:32.048 --> 00:59:34.414
Actually. um.
it‘s been pure shit.

1366
00:59:35.619 --> 00:59:37.587
But it could be worse.

1367
00:59:37.787 --> 00:59:39.152
How do you get
through the day?

1368
00:59:39.222 --> 00:59:40.416
I work.

1369
00:59:40.590 --> 00:59:43.252
But I tend to. uh.
lose track.

1370
00:59:43.693 --> 00:59:46.753
I get on the bus
and I forget where I’m going

1371
00:59:46.830 --> 00:59:49.230
and I watch the streets go by

1372
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.490
and I just hope to God

1373
00:59:51.568 --> 00:59:54.332
that one of them will
remind me what I’m there for.

1374
00:59:55.372 --> 00:59:57.806
Oh. it‘s not
as bad as all that.

1375
00:59:59.109 --> 01:00:01.839
I’ve been trying to
get out of my rut.

1376
01:00:03.213 --> 01:00:04.703
I am thinking

1377
01:00:05.448 --> 01:00:08.212
about. uh. uh. going
to Czechoslovakia.

1378
01:00:09.352 --> 01:00:10.341
Why?

1379
01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:13.819
Because I’ve never wanted
to go to Czechoslovakia.

1380
01:00:14.124 --> 01:00:16.422
[giggling]
And it‘s something new.

1381
01:00:16.626 --> 01:00:20.528
and I’m trying very hard.
you know. to be less. uh.
what. uh. compulsive.

1382
01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:23.230
To be a little bit
more spontaneous.

1383
01:00:24.367 --> 01:00:26.232
Last week. I bought a snake.

1384
01:00:28.438 --> 01:00:29.598
You bought a snake?

1385
01:00:29.673 --> 01:00:32.301
It felt kind of strange
at first. but. uh.

1386
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:35.373
once you get used to him.
he‘s lovely. He‘s lovely.

1387
01:00:35.445 --> 01:00:36.707
He‘s a nice pet.

1388
01:00:37.347 --> 01:00:38.837
Yeah?
Yeah.

1389
01:00:38.982 --> 01:00:42.748
He‘s disgusting to start with
because he eats mice alive.

1390
01:00:45.522 --> 01:00:48.047
You‘ve really been through
the wringer. haven‘t you?

1391
01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:52.592
Uh. I’m all right.
I really am all right.

1392
01:00:52.662 --> 01:00:56.120
In fact. in some ways I think
I’m stronger than ever.

1393
01:00:56.199 --> 01:00:58.258
The only thing is that

1394
01:00:58.835 --> 01:01:01.395
every time I think about
going to Czechoslovakia

1395
01:01:01.471 --> 01:01:03.405
I. uh. I start to cry.

1396
01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.241
I’ll--I’lI stop by
for Lisa later.

1397
01:01:12.315 --> 01:01:14.977
And we‘re gonna
call you Monday
for dinner. okay?

1398
01:01:15.051 --> 01:01:16.279
Okay.
Anne?

1399
01:01:16.353 --> 01:01:17.411
What?

1400
01:01:17.487 --> 01:01:18.852
Will you call me
at the office?

1401
01:01:18.922 --> 01:01:21.117
Because I think I can
get an assignment for you.

1402
01:01:22.292 --> 01:01:23.384
I love you.

1403
01:01:25.261 --> 01:01:26.626
Do me a favor

1404
01:01:26.696 --> 01:01:29.290
and don‘t tell Nick
about the snake. all right?

1405
01:01:29.366 --> 01:01:30.458
No.

1406
01:01:30.533 --> 01:01:32.330
He thinks I’m crazy
as it is.

1407
01:01:40.410 --> 01:01:41.968
I’ll tell you what.

1408
01:01:43.413 --> 01:01:44.778
To hell with Nick.

1409
01:01:44.948 --> 01:01:47.917
Tell him. uh. it‘s
a goddamn boa constrictor.

1410
01:01:57.093 --> 01:01:58.651
I don‘t understand him.

1411
01:01:58.728 --> 01:02:00.320
How could he do that
to her?

1412
01:02:00.397 --> 01:02:02.797
He‘s got a long history
of doing that to her.

1413
01:02:02.866 --> 01:02:06.427
He‘s been having affairs
with other women all along.
Dozens!

1414
01:02:06.503 --> 01:02:07.731
Oh. you‘re kidding.

1415
01:02:07.804 --> 01:02:09.169
How could you not know?

1416
01:02:10.673 --> 01:02:12.937
They even slept
at your apartment once.

1417
01:02:13.009 --> 01:02:14.067
Where was l?

1418
01:02:14.144 --> 01:02:16.408
You gave him your keys
so he could feed your cat

1419
01:02:16.479 --> 01:02:19.471
and water your plants
when you went away
for the weekend.

1420
01:02:20.350 --> 01:02:22.648
Didn‘t you notice the funny
look on the cat‘s face

1421
01:02:22.719 --> 01:02:24.016
when you came home?

1422
01:02:24.187 --> 01:02:25.677
That son of a bitch.

1423
01:02:27.357 --> 01:02:28.585
He told you all this?

1424
01:02:28.658 --> 01:02:30.057
He told me
some of it.

1425
01:02:30.393 --> 01:02:32.827
Some of it came out
when he was under gas.

1426
01:02:32.896 --> 01:02:34.124
I don‘t know.

1427
01:02:34.197 --> 01:02:35.357
Jeez!

1428
01:02:35.432 --> 01:02:37.627
I’ve lost all my illusions
about that guy.

1429
01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:40.362
Every time I think about him
I get angry and depressed.

1430
01:02:40.437 --> 01:02:41.927
I just can‘t
believe that of him.

1431
01:02:42.005 --> 01:02:44.337
Ah. maybe it‘s this
time of the year.

1432
01:02:44.407 --> 01:02:46.102
Always hated autumn.

1433
01:02:46.242 --> 01:02:47.869
Everybody says
it‘s so beautiful

1434
01:02:47.944 --> 01:02:50.936
but for me it‘s just--just
another time of death.

1435
01:02:51.014 --> 01:02:53.039
I always get psoriasis
in autumn.

1436
01:02:53.116 --> 01:02:55.983
Danny. believe me.
you‘re not gonna die
from psoriasis.

1437
01:02:57.854 --> 01:02:59.151
What‘s that
supposed to mean?

1438
01:02:59.222 --> 01:03:01.690
I’m just trying
to comfort you.
Don‘t get paranoid.

1439
01:03:01.991 --> 01:03:04.323
How come everyone
thinks I’m paranoid?

1440
01:03:05.095 --> 01:03:07.188
You discuss this
behind my back. don‘t you?

1441
01:03:07.263 --> 01:03:09.026
Danny. relax. would you?

1442
01:03:09.099 --> 01:03:10.964
Come on. come on.
I’m sorry.

1443
01:03:12.402 --> 01:03:14.996
lf you could just realize
what a terrific person you are

1444
01:03:15.071 --> 01:03:17.232
you wouldn‘t think
everybody was out to get you.

1445
01:03:17.307 --> 01:03:18.638
Don‘t try to
analyze me. okay?

1446
01:03:18.708 --> 01:03:19.970
First.
I’m not your patient.

1447
01:03:20.043 --> 01:03:21.237
Second.
you‘re not a doctor.

1448
01:03:21.311 --> 01:03:22.573
I’m just trying to help.

1449
01:03:22.645 --> 01:03:24.545
You‘re not helping.
you‘re patronizing me.

1450
01:03:24.614 --> 01:03:25.740
So cut it out. okay?
Okay. Okay.

1451
01:03:25.815 --> 01:03:27.146
Don‘t--don‘t get
so overwrought.

1452
01:03:27.217 --> 01:03:28.514
What can I do for you?

1453
01:03:28.585 --> 01:03:30.985
First of all.
you can take your arm
off my shoulder

1454
01:03:31.054 --> 01:03:32.715
and stick it
up your ass.

1455
01:03:38.962 --> 01:03:41.362
Look. sweetheart.
I know what
you‘re going through.

1456
01:03:41.431 --> 01:03:43.422
My parents separated
when I was a kid. too.

1457
01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.331
I hated them for it.

1458
01:03:46.703 --> 01:03:48.728
I promised myself
that when I grew up

1459
01:03:48.805 --> 01:03:51.797
I’d remember what it was like
and never do that
to one of mine.

1460
01:03:52.976 --> 01:03:55.968
Trouble is. now I see
it from the other side.

1461
01:03:56.846 --> 01:03:59.314
But you‘ve very mature
for your age.
You‘re resilient.

1462
01:03:59.382 --> 01:04:02.249
This will pass
and in no time you‘ll be
singing and laughing.

1463
01:04:03.119 --> 01:04:04.984
Believe me.
you‘re gonna be laughing.

1464
01:04:11.194 --> 01:04:12.559
[Nick sighs]

1465
01:04:12.629 --> 01:04:15.393
Look. your entire world
doesn‘t revolve around me.

1466
01:04:15.465 --> 01:04:17.365
You‘ve got your
own life to live.

1467
01:04:17.433 --> 01:04:19.458
You‘ve made some friends
at your dorm. right?

1468
01:04:19.536 --> 01:04:20.798
Not really.

1469
01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:22.460
Most of the people
I’ve met here

1470
01:04:22.539 --> 01:04:24.268
have a peculiar idea
of a good time.

1471
01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:25.432
Like what?

1472
01:04:26.876 --> 01:04:29.572
They get drunk
and piss off the balconies.

1473
01:04:29.646 --> 01:04:31.045
[laughing]

1474
01:04:32.649 --> 01:04:34.344
What about the girls?

1475
01:04:34.417 --> 01:04:36.351
I’m talking about the girls.

1476
01:04:38.454 --> 01:04:40.081
You‘re kidding me. right?

1477
01:04:40.156 --> 01:04:41.555
I’m kidding you?

1478
01:04:41.624 --> 01:04:43.421
You think it‘s a joke
to have to walk home

1479
01:04:43.493 --> 01:04:45.961
on a clear night
with an umbrella?

1480

[birds chirping]

1481
01:04:49.899 --> 01:04:51.264
Haven‘t you got
any friends here?

1482
01:04:51.334 --> 01:04:52.460
They don‘t interest me.

1483
01:04:52.535 --> 01:04:54.730
Oh. come on.
There must be somebody.

1484
01:04:54.938 --> 01:04:56.030
Hey!

1485
01:04:56.372 --> 01:04:59.307
What about that
kid from. uh. Ohio?

1486
01:04:59.576 --> 01:05:01.544
Yeah. Marilyn Oupenski.

1487
01:05:01.611 --> 01:05:03.238
Yeah.
She was great.

1488
01:05:03.313 --> 01:05:05.907
She was a lot like me.
A lot like me.

1489
01:05:06.916 --> 01:05:08.645
Her parents made her go home.

1490
01:05:08.718 --> 01:05:09.776
Why?

1491
01:05:10.286 --> 01:05:12.413
She tried to swallow
a bottle of pills.

1492
01:05:14.424 --> 01:05:15.914
Why didn‘t you tell me?

1493
01:05:15.992 --> 01:05:17.254
What for?

1494
01:05:17.327 --> 01:05:19.989
Lisa. if the one person
you identify with
in this place

1495
01:05:20.063 --> 01:05:21.860
happens to swallow
a bottle of pills

1496
01:05:21.931 --> 01:05:23.762
don‘t you think
I’d be mildly interested?

1497
01:05:23.833 --> 01:05:25.425
You keep making
all these decisions

1498
01:05:25.501 --> 01:05:27.469
that affect my life
without asking me.

1499
01:05:27.537 --> 01:05:29.198
That doesn‘t seem
to bother you.

1500
01:05:31.207 --> 01:05:33.937
You know what this is?
This is emotional blackmail.

1501
01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:36.877
I’m trying to appeal
to your sense of intelligence
and maturity

1502
01:05:36.946 --> 01:05:40.245
you sit there like
the Bride of Frankenstein
talking about suicide.

1503
01:05:49.325 --> 01:05:51.156
Come on. sweetheart.

1504
01:05:52.895 --> 01:05:55.261
You‘re not as morose as
all that and you know it.

1505
01:05:55.331 --> 01:05:57.799
You got a great big smile
down there somewhere

1506
01:05:57.867 --> 01:05:59.459
and you just won‘t let it out.

1507
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:02.165
Come on. give in.

1508
01:06:03.539 --> 01:06:05.734
Let‘s have a nice big smile.

1509
01:06:07.410 --> 01:06:09.378
I know you got one
in there.

1510
01:06:09.445 --> 01:06:12.642
I can see it sitting there.
dying to come out.

1511
01:06:14.917 --> 01:06:16.475
Here it comes.

1512
01:06:16.552 --> 01:06:19.680
I can see it curling up
at the corner of your mouth.

1513
01:06:19.956 --> 01:06:21.548
Come on. here it comes.

1514
01:06:21.624 --> 01:06:23.057
Here comes the smile.

For what?

1519
01:06:39.108 --> 01:06:40.735
I got excited.
I spoke my mind

1520
01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:42.903
I said I was sorry
and it‘s over and done with.

1521
01:06:42.979 --> 01:06:44.970
I don‘t understand
how you can hurt someone

1522
01:06:45.048 --> 01:06:47.642
as guileless
and vulnerable as Ginny.

1523
01:06:48.818 --> 01:06:51.150
She sure took on
a lot of mystical qualities

1524
01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:52.949
once you saw her
swimming naked.

1525
01:06:53.356 --> 01:06:54.618
How can you say that?

1526
01:06:54.691 --> 01:06:56.716
I just say what I think.
Mmm-hmm.

1527
01:06:56.793 --> 01:06:59.023
Well.
maybe that‘s the problem.

1528
01:06:59.095 --> 01:07:02.155
Why do you always have to say
what you think?

1529
01:07:02.332 --> 01:07:05.324
You think your thoughts
should just fall down
from your brain

onto your tongue
like a gumball machine!

start watching what I think

You no longer
have to announce

your ethnic origin
in this state!

knows you‘re Italian!

What‘s with you?

I’m sorry. I just feel
very let down by you.

Why? What have l
done to you?

What is your idea of a close
intimate friendship?

I don‘t understand.

01:07:59.222 --> 01:08:00.587
I’ve hurt you in some way?

1553
01:08:00.823 --> 01:08:03.792
I happen to know you betrayed
your wife dozens of times.

1554

I did to her.
What did I do to you?

You didn‘t tell
either of us.

one at a time.

You can understand
my not telling her. right?

1559
01:08:17.673 --> 01:08:19.698
I can‘t understand you
saying on the one hand

1560
01:08:19.776 --> 01:08:21.141
that you could
tell me anything.

1561
01:08:21.210 --> 01:08:25.010
And on the other hand
not telling me a goddamn thing
except what suits you.

1562
01:08:25.081 --> 01:08:27.106
I feel as betrayed
as she does.

Jack. all I’ve ever
gotten from you

is judgment and disapproval.

You expect me to come
and tell you

1566

every time I’ve had an affair
with a hatcheck girl?

That‘s who you were
having affairs with?

Hatcheck girls?

1569

No!

They were all intelligent.
worthy women.
The top in their field.

01:08:42.465 --> 01:08:43.625
I can‘t tell you their names

1572

but two of them were
Margaret Thatcher
and Indira Gandhi.

When you wanna talk
intelligently. I’ll talk.

1574

Otherwise. forget it.

When did you
get this?

1576

Couple of weeks ago.

1577
01:08:55.445 --> 01:08:56.844
Do you have any
good friends here?

Mmm-hmm.
I like this.

Who are your friends?

01:09:00.450 --> 01:09:01.542
People.

1581
01:09:01.617 --> 01:09:02.641
Good.

1582
01:09:03.519 --> 01:09:04.884
What about Lisa?

1583
01:09:05.254 --> 01:09:06.653
Forget it.

1584
01:09:06.889 --> 01:09:08.254
When you were
in high school

1585
01:09:08.324 --> 01:09:10.588
you were on the phone
with her almost every night.

1586
01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:11.718
Not anymore.

1587
01:09:11.794 --> 01:09:12.818
What‘s the problem?

1588
01:09:13.196 --> 01:09:15.289
She‘s such a bitch
sometimes!

1589
01:09:15.865 --> 01:09:18.698
Sh-she just gets<i>...</i>
I don‘t know.

1590
01:09:18.768 --> 01:09:20.633
She says
she‘ll meet me someplace

1591
01:09:20.703 --> 01:09:21.897
and she doesn‘t show up.

1592
01:09:21.971 --> 01:09:23.802
Sometimes she‘ll just
sit there for an hour

1593
01:09:23.873 --> 01:09:25.067
without talking.

1594
01:09:25.374 --> 01:09:26.773
It’s like she‘s
trying to test me

1595
01:09:26.843 --> 01:09:28.333
and see how much
shit I’ll take.

1596
01:09:28.678 --> 01:09:29.804
She probably is.

1597
01:09:29.879 --> 01:09:31.176
I hate it!

1598
01:09:32.715 --> 01:09:34.444
Hey. babe. come here.

1599
01:09:39.355 --> 01:09:40.686
What if. uh.

1600
01:09:42.391 --> 01:09:45.155
what if you just accepted her
for what she is. huh?

1601
01:09:45.228 --> 01:09:46.456
I do.

1602
01:09:46.596 --> 01:09:48.461
Trouble is. what she is.
is a bitch.

1603
01:09:48.564 --> 01:09:49.553
Oh.

1604
01:09:50.032 --> 01:09:51.795
When she acts like that.
maybe you--

1605
01:09:51.868 --> 01:09:53.358
maybe you could
just laugh at her.

1606
01:09:53.436 --> 01:09:55.427
You know. like she was
a character in a story.

1607
01:09:55.505 --> 01:09:56.472
Mom. that‘s impossible.

1608
01:09:56.539 --> 01:09:57.471
Why?

1609
01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:00.236
Because it is. Forget it.
Change the subject.

1610
01:10:01.377 --> 01:10:02.571
Okay.

1611
01:10:04.814 --> 01:10:06.042
What other friends
do you have?

1612
01:10:06.115 --> 01:10:09.551
Oh. stop it! Be quiet!
Time to stop talking now!

1613
01:10:09.619 --> 01:10:11.849
I’m closing off your breath!
Here we go!

1614
01:10:12.355 --> 01:10:13.788
This is so good.

1615
01:10:13.856 --> 01:10:16.381
Mmm. I hope
this is homemade.

1616
01:10:16.459 --> 01:10:18.893
Just look at all
those calories.

1617
01:10:19.795 --> 01:10:21.285
Do you want
a bite?

1618
01:10:21.364 --> 01:10:22.888
Oh. God. I got
too much in my mouth.

1619
01:10:23.799 --> 01:10:24.925
[laughing]
Thank you.

1620
01:10:25.034 --> 01:10:26.763
You are
such a slob.

1621
01:10:26.836 --> 01:10:29.771
Okay.
That‘s $23 from Nick

1622
01:10:29.839 --> 01:10:32.535
$24.50 from Jack
and $16 from me

1623
01:10:32.608 --> 01:10:34.667
But let‘s split it
three ways.

1624
01:10:34.744 --> 01:10:36.644
Then why tell us
what everybody spent?

1625
01:10:36.712 --> 01:10:39.180
Because if there‘s
a discrepancy
in anyone‘s share

1626
01:10:39.248 --> 01:10:41.045
it will benefit
everyone to know about it.

1627
01:10:41.117 --> 01:10:43.677
How can I know
what my share was unless
I compulsively added up

1628
01:10:43.753 --> 01:10:45.220
my bill the whole time
I was eating?

1629
01:10:45.288 --> 01:10:47.813
Oh.
now I’m compulsive.

1630
01:10:47.890 --> 01:10:49.551
10 minutes ago.
I was paranoid.

1631
01:10:49.625 --> 01:10:51.217
(Nick)
Give me the check.
I’ll pay it.

1632
01:10:51.294 --> 01:10:55.060
I’m sorry. I’m not a member of
the Million Dollar Roundtable.

1633
01:10:55.631 --> 01:10:58.065
You want the check?
Here. you got it.

1634
01:10:58.134 --> 01:11:00.500
(Nick)
Come on.
you‘re a successful dentist.

1635
01:11:00.570 --> 01:11:01.537
(Danny)
That‘s right.

1636
01:11:01.604 --> 01:11:03.799
And this is a checkup
and cleaning.

1637
01:11:03.873 --> 01:11:06.034
Takes me a long time
to scrape. polish.

1638
01:11:06.108 --> 01:11:07.473
and poke to make this.

1639
01:11:07.543 --> 01:11:09.408
Hey. Danny. calm down.

1640
01:11:09.478 --> 01:11:10.911
Please don‘t tell
me to calm down.

1641
01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:13.744
This is the second time today
somebody‘s told me
to calm down.

1642
01:11:13.816 --> 01:11:15.875
I’m sorry.
it‘s only my first.

1643
01:11:15.952 --> 01:11:18.079
lf he wants to keep the books.
let him keep them.

1644
01:11:18.154 --> 01:11:19.416
I don‘t want to
keep the books.

1645
01:11:19.488 --> 01:11:20.682
I’ll pay the check.

1646
01:11:20.756 --> 01:11:22.223
(Danny)
Again. I am not upset.

1647
01:11:22.291 --> 01:11:23.258
(Jack)
Don‘t get upset.

1648
01:11:23.326 --> 01:11:25.021
I told you.
I was not upset.

1649
01:11:25.094 --> 01:11:26.356
Here. take the check.

1650
01:11:26.429 --> 01:11:28.795
I don‘t want the check.
I’m not upset.

1651
01:11:29.098 --> 01:11:30.690
Don‘t get him upset.
will you?

1652
01:11:30.766 --> 01:11:32.996
I didn‘t get him upset!
You got him upset.

1653
01:11:33.069 --> 01:11:34.798
I told you.
I’m not upset.

1654
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:36.599
This is ridiculous.
Why do you<i>...</i>

1655
01:13:23.412 --> 01:13:24.640
[sighs]

1656
01:13:30.319 --> 01:13:31.650
[groaning]

1657
01:13:35.257 --> 01:13:37.088
Oh. God.

1658
01:13:39.495 --> 01:13:41.725
Oh. God.

1659
01:13:43.599 --> 01:13:45.760
It really took off
a lot of skin.

1660
01:13:50.139 --> 01:13:51.299
What are you doing?

1661
01:13:51.373 --> 01:13:54.206
I’ve been out in the cold
all day and my skin is dry.

1662
01:13:56.212 --> 01:13:58.373
I wonder if they have
any ice down the hall.

1663
01:13:58.447 --> 01:14:00.608
Gee. I don‘t know.
Why don‘t you go see?

1664
01:14:02.418 --> 01:14:03.578
Are you mad at me?

1665
01:14:03.652 --> 01:14:04.676
You got it.

1666
01:14:06.622 --> 01:14:08.715
You picked a hell of
a time to get irrational.

1667
01:14:08.791 --> 01:14:11.521
Oh. I’m not irrational.
Rational people get angry!

1668
01:14:11.594 --> 01:14:13.789
irrational people
pretend they don‘t.

1669
01:14:13.863 --> 01:14:15.524
Okay.
just stop it right there!

1670
01:14:15.598 --> 01:14:18.158
I have a very bad temper!
Don‘t make me use it!

1671
01:14:18.234 --> 01:14:19.223
Use it.

1672
01:14:19.301 --> 01:14:22.065
I don‘t happen to think
there‘s anything
wrong with anger.

1673
01:14:22.505 --> 01:14:24.666
I’m going to be
very calm about this.

1674
01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:25.934
Why do you resent me?

1675
01:14:26.008 --> 01:14:27.942
Because when you fight
you get calm.

1676
01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:29.375
You don‘t like that?

1677
01:14:29.512 --> 01:14:30.911
It drives me nuts.

1678
01:14:31.781 --> 01:14:34.341
I also don‘t
like having to guess
your every need

1679
01:14:34.416 --> 01:14:36.111
when you don‘t give
a damn about mine.

1680
01:14:36.185 --> 01:14:37.743
I don‘t like that a lot!

1681
01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:40.288
What needs do you have
that I don‘t give
a damn about?

1682
01:14:40.356 --> 01:14:43.416
Don‘t you ever feel
like going someplace
alone with me?

1683
01:14:43.826 --> 01:14:45.760
You want to take
a vacation without them?

1684
01:14:46.061 --> 01:14:49.224
I have this perverse desire
to be married to
one person at a time.

1685
01:14:49.298 --> 01:14:50.925
I don‘t know. it excites me!

1686
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.797
I thought--I thought
you liked them.

1687
01:14:52.868 --> 01:14:56.360
I adore them.
but it‘s getting so
I can‘t breathe!

1688
01:14:57.072 --> 01:14:59.563
Anne doesn‘t know
how lucky she is to be out!

1689
01:14:59.642 --> 01:15:01.075
You know.

1690
01:15:01.177 --> 01:15:03.202
Danny probably has
his ear pressed

1691
01:15:03.279 --> 01:15:05.247
to that door listening
to everything.

1692
01:15:07.116 --> 01:15:08.174
Danny dear.

1693
01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:10.810
please don‘t be offended.
You know how fond I am of you

1694
01:15:10.886 --> 01:15:12.979
but I think your
Mercedes sucks.

1695
01:15:13.656 --> 01:15:15.419
You the one who
organizes these trips.

1696
01:15:15.491 --> 01:15:17.083
And I hate it.

1697
01:15:17.159 --> 01:15:19.059
Doesn‘t it ever occur
to you that sometimes

1698
01:15:19.128 --> 01:15:20.959
I’d like to be the one
with the sore knee?

1699
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:22.122
No.

1700
01:15:22.198 --> 01:15:24.996
You handle everything
like the most efficient people
I know!

1701
01:15:25.067 --> 01:15:26.591
Uh. nobody can do
what you do.

1702
01:15:26.669 --> 01:15:28.068
My God. you‘re perfect.

1703
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:30.267
How dare you
call me that?

1704
01:15:30.339 --> 01:15:31.863
How dare
I call you perfect?
Yes.

1705
01:15:31.941 --> 01:15:33.408
Yes. isn‘t that
what I heard?

1706
01:15:33.475 --> 01:15:35.875
What‘s wrong with perfect?
How can you get upset?

1707
01:15:35.945 --> 01:15:38.971
Because when I’m perfect.
I cease to exist!

1708
01:15:40.115 --> 01:15:42.447
Y-you don‘t have to
hug me when--when I’m low

1709
01:15:42.518 --> 01:15:44.782
or cheer me up with
a bunch of $2 daffodils.

1710
01:15:44.854 --> 01:15:46.845
I don‘t surprise
you with daffodils?

1711
01:15:46.922 --> 01:15:48.787
You know I do.
You know I do.

1712
01:15:48.858 --> 01:15:50.382
When you feel like it!

1713
01:15:50.459 --> 01:15:53.428
When it makes you feel good.
but not when I need them!

1714
01:15:53.829 --> 01:15:57.026
Goddamn it!
I’m standing here bleeding!

1715
01:15:57.099 --> 01:15:59.966
Blood is running down my leg
and we‘re talking
about daffodils!

1716
01:16:00.035 --> 01:16:02.697
Because I also resent you
for hurting yourself.

1717
01:16:02.771 --> 01:16:03.760
Oh. oh. oh.

1718
01:16:03.839 --> 01:16:05.636
And that‘s not irrational.
huh?

1719
01:16:05.708 --> 01:16:08.040
You think I like to see
you so jealous of Nick

1720
01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:09.771
that you have to tackle him?

1721
01:16:09.845 --> 01:16:11.972
(Kate)
You think that
makes me feel good?

1722
01:16:15.150 --> 01:16:16.640
We should get to
the heart of this.

1723
01:16:16.719 --> 01:16:18.118
The heart of this

1724
01:16:18.187 --> 01:16:20.747
is that you wish you had
some blonde nymph

1725
01:16:20.956 --> 01:16:22.389
adoring you like he does.

1726
01:16:22.458 --> 01:16:24.050
So go on! Go find one!

1727
01:16:24.126 --> 01:16:27.323
Christ. how long you going
to hang on to these fantasies?

1728
01:16:27.763 --> 01:16:30.391
The reality is you‘re married
to a middle-aged woman

1729
01:16:30.466 --> 01:16:32.559
with a good sense of humor
and dry skin!

1730
01:16:32.701 --> 01:16:35.761
And if you don‘t like it
then go find yourself a nymph.

1731
01:16:36.205 --> 01:16:38.139
Just do me the courtesy
of telling me.

1732
01:16:38.207 --> 01:16:40.732
In other words.
and I mean this
in the most loving way.

1733
01:16:40.809 --> 01:16:42.640
shit.
or get off the pot!

1734
01:16:46.849 --> 01:16:48.942
Katherine.
I’m sorry to say this.

1735
01:16:49.351 --> 01:16:51.148
What? Say it!

1736
01:16:51.453 --> 01:16:53.318
You ‘re making me furious.

1737
01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:56.187
You‘re furious now?

1738
01:16:56.325 --> 01:16:57.622
I’m enraged.

1739
01:16:57.693 --> 01:17:00.253
How can you tell?
I can‘t see the difference!

1740
01:17:00.396 --> 01:17:03.160
Maybe you could learn
to stamp your
foot as a signal.

1741
01:17:03.232 --> 01:17:04.529
Look. try this!

1742
01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:06.531
[screaming]

1743
01:17:06.602 --> 01:17:08.229
Will you shut up?

1744
01:17:08.804 --> 01:17:10.635
You know how
that voice carries?

1745
01:17:10.706 --> 01:17:12.731
When you‘re mad at me.
I expect to see it.

1746
01:17:12.808 --> 01:17:14.070
I don‘t want to read about it

1747
01:17:14.143 --> 01:17:16.407
two years from now
in your goddamn diary!

1748
01:17:26.755 --> 01:17:29.485
You know how our good times
together come in waves?

1749
01:17:30.125 --> 01:17:33.151
Right now I would say
we were in a very deep trough.

1750
01:17:56.085 --> 01:17:57.347
Hi. guys.

1751
01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.544
How you doing?

1752
01:17:59.621 --> 01:18:00.553
Great.

1753
01:18:00.622 --> 01:18:03.216
God. is Nick sore.

1754
01:18:03.659 --> 01:18:05.183
Poor guy.

1755
01:18:06.261 --> 01:18:08.752
He just loves
to be babied.

1756
01:18:10.232 --> 01:18:12.063
Think that‘s enough?

1757
01:18:12.167 --> 01:18:14.465
Well. see you tomorrow.
(Nick)
Hurry up!

1758
01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:17.004
I’m coming! Bye.

1759
01:18:26.548 --> 01:18:27.947
Good night.

1760
01:19:58.941 --> 01:20:01.910
Jack! What do you say?

1761
01:21:11.013 --> 01:21:12.981
Come on!
Come on!

1762
01:21:25.394 --> 01:21:26.918
[screaming]
Oh. shit!

1763
01:22:32.361 --> 01:22:34.522
[people chattering]

1764
01:22:39.167 --> 01:22:40.998
Wait right
out there.

1765
01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:42.928
The doctor wants
us to wait outside.

1766
01:22:43.005 --> 01:22:44.233
(Ginny)
He really amazes me.

1767
01:22:45.774 --> 01:22:48.242
We‘ll see you
in five minutes.

1768
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:50.403
(Danny)
You all right. babe?
I’ll see you around.

1769
01:22:50.479 --> 01:22:52.140
What‘s this? Crutches!

1770
01:22:52.214 --> 01:22:53.738
(Claudia)
Crutches are havoc.

1771
01:22:54.716 --> 01:22:55.842
What‘s that?

1772
01:22:55.984 --> 01:22:57.110
What?

1773
01:22:57.185 --> 01:22:58.846
That. The limping stuff?
What is it?

1774
01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:00.581
I got a blister.

1775
01:23:01.957 --> 01:23:03.185
Excuse me.

1776
01:23:03.659 --> 01:23:04.683
(Ginny)
Doctor?

1777
01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:05.749
Ginny. I don‘t--

1778
01:23:05.827 --> 01:23:07.488
Could you look at
his leg. too. please?

1779
01:23:07.562 --> 01:23:08.961
Sure. After
we‘re finished here.

1780
01:23:09.031 --> 01:23:10.362
You can hop up
on the table.

1781
01:23:10.432 --> 01:23:11.763
There‘s nothing
wrong with me!

1782
01:23:11.833 --> 01:23:14.301
You landed awful hard
once. I saw you.

1783
01:23:14.369 --> 01:23:15.631
Nick. I saw it. too.

1784
01:23:15.704 --> 01:23:17.467
We saw it!
(Jack)
I saw that. too.

1785
01:23:17.539 --> 01:23:19.234
[snickering]
All right. All right.
All right.

1786
01:23:19.308 --> 01:23:21.640
You want to take an X-ray
of my foot. go ahead.

1787
01:23:21.710 --> 01:23:23.234
Take my picture.
Which one?

1788
01:23:41.029 --> 01:23:43.122
(Nick)
I’ll tell you the funniest
sight in the world was.

1789
01:23:43.198 --> 01:23:44.756
It was you
going on that jump.

1790
01:23:44.833 --> 01:23:46.425
You looked like
a dying turkey.

1791
01:23:46.501 --> 01:23:48.833
[all chattering]

1792
01:23:49.237 --> 01:23:52.729
The arms and
the legs started to go.
I thought I would die!

1793
01:23:53.275 --> 01:23:56.904
Listen. the thing to
do is take the boat

1794
01:23:56.978 --> 01:23:58.741
from Southampton
when you‘re traveling.

1795
01:23:58.814 --> 01:24:00.008
(Ginny)
Oh. yeah?

1796
01:24:00.082 --> 01:24:01.845
And take<i>...</i>

1797
01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:04.610
It’s climbing
a quarter of a degree an hour.

1798
01:24:04.686 --> 01:24:07.052
I’m not going out
in that cold anymore.

1799
01:24:07.456 --> 01:24:11.358
That‘s exactly half of us
felled by disaster
on our first day.

1800
01:24:11.426 --> 01:24:14.122
So what do you suppose
we should do now?

1801
01:24:14.863 --> 01:24:16.387
How about if we talk?

1802
01:24:17.265 --> 01:24:18.254
Talk?

1803
01:24:19.234 --> 01:24:22.465
Ever since we saw
the kids up at school.
we‘ve been walking on eggs.

1804
01:24:22.537 --> 01:24:24.300
I’m gonna get coffee.
What do you mean?

1805
01:24:24.373 --> 01:24:27.706
We have dinner.
we talk about the kids.
we talk about the news

1806
01:24:27.776 --> 01:24:29.767
but we--we don‘t really talk.

1807
01:24:30.779 --> 01:24:31.905
About what?

1808
01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:33.004
About us.

1809
01:24:33.982 --> 01:24:36.815
You‘re gonna jump over me
but I think we should
clear the air.

1810
01:24:36.885 --> 01:24:38.284
(all)
Oh. no!

1811
01:24:39.654 --> 01:24:42.350
Please. some of us
aren‘t feeling too well.
do you mind?

1812
01:24:42.858 --> 01:24:45.520
We should sit down for a while
and hash this thing out.

1813
01:24:45.594 --> 01:24:47.653
I’d rather have
my teeth drilled.

1814
01:24:47.829 --> 01:24:50.195
What do you want to open up
a big can of worms for?

1815
01:24:50.265 --> 01:24:52.256
Because I thought it
was worth it. Forget it.

1816
01:24:52.334 --> 01:24:53.892
[cheering]

1817
01:24:53.969 --> 01:24:55.027
All right!

1818
01:24:55.103 --> 01:24:56.627
Okay. that‘s it.

1819
01:25:02.911 --> 01:25:04.003
Did you see this?

1820
01:25:04.079 --> 01:25:05.239
I saw it.

1821
01:25:06.548 --> 01:25:07.845
Anne‘s got
pictures in it.

1822
01:25:07.916 --> 01:25:08.905
Yeah.

1823
01:25:09.651 --> 01:25:12.677
She‘s making friends.
she‘s working.
she‘s never been better.

1824
01:25:12.754 --> 01:25:14.984
And you‘ll notice.
these are pictures
of people.

1825
01:25:15.690 --> 01:25:17.021
not kumquats.

1826
01:25:18.193 --> 01:25:19.626
I saw it.

1827
01:25:20.395 --> 01:25:21.521
Hey. guys.

1828
01:25:22.264 --> 01:25:23.822
why don‘t we
have some fun?

1829
01:25:24.666 --> 01:25:27.999
You know that roadhouse.
about 15 miles from here?

1830
01:25:28.069 --> 01:25:29.001
(all)
Yeah?

1831
01:25:29.070 --> 01:25:31.265
They‘re going to have
music tonight. right?

1832
01:25:31.339 --> 01:25:33.637
I mean. we can‘t all dance

1833
01:25:33.708 --> 01:25:36.142
but we could sit
and have a beer.
listen to the music.

1834
01:25:36.211 --> 01:25:38.543
Here we go.
I’d like to get out of here.

1835
01:25:38.613 --> 01:25:41.673
I think that‘s
a swell idea.

1836
01:25:41.917 --> 01:25:44.044
(Jack)
I’m not against
having a good time.

1837
01:25:44.386 --> 01:25:46.445
Let‘s have fun.

1838

(Kate)
Don‘t hurt yourself laughing.

1839
01:25:49.658 --> 01:25:52.354
When are you
going to forgive me
for marrying Ginny. ever?

1840
01:25:52.427 --> 01:25:53.655
You can do anything you want.

1841
01:25:53.728 --> 01:25:54.786
Oh. thanks.

1842
01:25:54.863 --> 01:25:56.922
Where‘s the warmth
you‘re always talking about?

1843
01:25:56.998 --> 01:25:58.522
You‘re as cold
as that frozen lake.

1844
01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:01.467
I adore Ginny. I have nothing
but the deepest affection

1845
01:26:01.536 --> 01:26:02.628
for both of you.

1846
01:26:02.704 --> 01:26:04.035
But you won‘t
forgive me?

1847
01:26:04.105 --> 01:26:05.538
Is this man crazy
or what?

1848
01:26:05.607 --> 01:26:07.507
No. he‘s not crazy.

1849
01:26:07.576 --> 01:26:09.737
You want us to
level with one another?

1850
01:26:09.811 --> 01:26:11.938
The truth is
we‘re all mad at you.

1851
01:26:12.013 --> 01:26:14.573
We love Ginny but we‘re upset
because Anne isn‘t here.

1852
01:26:14.649 --> 01:26:16.082
Maybe they‘re mad.
but I’m not.

1853
01:26:16.151 --> 01:26:17.413
Well. good.

1854
01:26:17.819 --> 01:26:20.151
As long as
we‘re all honest and open.

1855
01:26:20.355 --> 01:26:22.983
Is this the fun part?
Are we having fun yet?

[Claudia laughing]

1857
01:26:26.328 --> 01:26:28.193
Ow!

1858
01:26:29.598 --> 01:26:30.656
Damn it!

What can I get you. folks?

1862
01:27:04.232 --> 01:27:05.927
Beer for me.

1863
01:27:06.001 --> 01:27:08.094
And I’ll have a J&B
on the rocks. too.

1864
01:27:12.874 --> 01:27:14.307
Great band.

1865
01:27:16.011 --> 01:27:17.740
You know. I always
wondered what happened

1866
01:27:17.812 --> 01:27:19.473
to the old Glen Miller
arrangement.

1867
01:27:19.548 --> 01:27:21.277
[all laughing]

1868
01:27:24.519 --> 01:27:26.612
So you don‘t think
I’m honest. huh?

1869
01:27:27.222 --> 01:27:29.747
Okay. Jack. forget it.
I’m sorry I said it.

1870
01:27:29.824 --> 01:27:31.121
No. say
what you think.

1871
01:27:31.192 --> 01:27:32.819
Do you really
want me to?
Yeah.

1872
01:27:34.729 --> 01:27:36.196
Well.

1873
01:27:36.264 --> 01:27:38.926
I think sometimes
you are a little cold.

1874
01:27:39.367 --> 01:27:41.301
There‘s a little part
of you always. uh.

1875
01:27:41.369 --> 01:27:43.803
that hangs back
and judges.

1876
01:27:44.506 --> 01:27:46.667
You always want to get
to the bottom of things

1877
01:27:46.741 --> 01:27:48.936
but only so long as you
can make the rules.

1878
01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:51.001
Mmm-hmm. I see.

1879
01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:54.778
That‘s all right.
it‘s human.

1880
01:27:54.849 --> 01:27:57.079
Okay. fine. I’m human.
I don‘t mind being human.

1881
01:27:57.152 --> 01:27:59.052
As long as we realize
you‘re human. too.

1882
01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:00.314
Yeah. I’m human.

1883
01:28:00.388 --> 01:28:01.878
As long as
we realize that

1884
01:28:01.957 --> 01:28:04.687
it‘s also human to be
the world‘s foremost authority

1885
01:28:04.759 --> 01:28:06.590
on everything
from the roast beef

to the nervous system
of the newt.

1887
01:28:09.798 --> 01:28:12.699
To be so completely obsessed
with your own body

1888
01:28:12.801 --> 01:28:15.133
that you take
your temperature
at the dinner table!

1889
01:28:15.203 --> 01:28:17.171
Look. I think maybe
you better just cool it.

1890
01:28:17.238 --> 01:28:18.569
No. it‘s all right.
don‘t worry.

1891
01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:19.868
You‘re going
a little too far.

1892
01:28:19.941 --> 01:28:21.670
(Jack)
No. it‘s all right.

1893
01:28:22.777 --> 01:28:25.041
Let me tell you something.
Jack.

1894
01:28:25.113 --> 01:28:27.138
I’m 10 years
older than you. right?

1895
01:28:27.215 --> 01:28:30.275
All right. I just hope
that when you get to be my age

1896
01:28:30.352 --> 01:28:33.253
you don‘t smell
the foul breath of death
and disintegration

1897
01:28:33.321 --> 01:28:36.688
hanging over your shoulder
the way I find it
hanging over mine.

1898
01:28:36.758 --> 01:28:38.817
I mean.
I go to sleep at night

1899
01:28:38.893 --> 01:28:40.952
on an ache so bad

1900
01:28:41.029 --> 01:28:43.224
that it simply
will not go away.

1901
01:28:43.732 --> 01:28:46.462
I wake up in the middle
of the night sweating

1902
01:28:46.935 --> 01:28:49.802
hearing my own bones decaying.

1903
01:28:50.639 --> 01:28:53.574
I have shifted into
a state of entropy

1904
01:28:53.642 --> 01:28:55.872
that‘s progressing
geometrically.

1905
01:28:56.211 --> 01:28:58.543
You see. ‘‘entropy.‘‘

1906
01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.310
‘‘progressing geometrically.‘‘

1907
01:29:01.383 --> 01:29:03.010
Y-you talk like
a bad textbook.

1908
01:29:03.084 --> 01:29:04.642
Why don‘t you
just speak English?

1909
01:29:04.719 --> 01:29:07.882
Goddamn it! I just told you
my deepest fear!

1910
01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:10.881
Why can‘t you
listen to what I’m saying

1911
01:29:10.959 --> 01:29:12.756
instead of how I’m saying it?

1912
01:29:13.228 --> 01:29:16.994
I mean. do you have
any idea. any idea.

1913
01:29:17.832 --> 01:29:20.027
what it is to be
afraid of death?

1914
01:29:21.336 --> 01:29:23.304
I can‘t eat my
bowl of cereal anymore

1915
01:29:23.371 --> 01:29:25.931
because I have
an irrational fear of milk.

1916
01:29:26.174 --> 01:29:28.233
I stand there in hallways<i>...</i>

1917
01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:33.813
I stand there in hallways

1918
01:29:33.882 --> 01:29:36.407
afraid to press
strange elevator buttons.

1919
01:29:37.652 --> 01:29:40.951
I almost threw away
my jockey shorts because
I have this fear of elastic.

1920
01:29:41.289 --> 01:29:42.847
[laughing]

1921
01:29:44.659 --> 01:29:46.923
Don‘t laugh at him.

1922
01:29:47.228 --> 01:29:49.287
Go on. go on. what?

1923
01:29:49.964 --> 01:29:52.626
Laugh. good.
I’m a fool. right?

1924
01:29:53.101 --> 01:29:54.534
[laughing]
No. Danny.

1925
01:29:54.602 --> 01:29:56.536
I’m a collection
of eccentricities.

1926
01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:01.834
You think because I’m quirky.
I don‘t hurt?

1927
01:30:02.544 --> 01:30:04.808
No.
Well. you have it wrong.

1928
01:30:05.947 --> 01:30:08.211
I’m quirky because I hurt.

1929
01:30:09.784 --> 01:30:11.411
Oh. Danny. I’m sorry.

1930
01:30:11.486 --> 01:30:12.953
All right.

1931
01:30:14.155 --> 01:30:15.782
Come on.

1932
01:30:16.057 --> 01:30:18.321
Are you really
afraid of your underwear?

1933
01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:19.984
[laughing]

1934
01:30:21.796 --> 01:30:23.354
[laughing]

1935
01:30:23.431 --> 01:30:25.194
I’m dying. she‘s laughing.

1936
01:30:25.266 --> 01:30:27.234
We‘re not laughing. Danny.
Honest.

1937
01:30:27.302 --> 01:30:28.894
We are.

1938
01:30:28.970 --> 01:30:31.495
Forget it. Forget it.
Let‘s listen to the music.

1939
01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:34.937
No. it‘s all right.
Forget it.

1940
01:30:35.276 --> 01:30:37.369
Okay. come on.
Danny. let‘s dance.

1941
01:30:37.445 --> 01:30:38.434
Come on.

1942
01:30:38.546 --> 01:30:40.377
No. thanks. No.
I don‘t want to dance.

1943
01:30:40.482 --> 01:30:41.949
Danny!

1944
01:30:42.383 --> 01:30:43.611
Dance.
Come on.

1945
01:30:43.685 --> 01:30:45.175
Go head. dance.
Go on. dance.

1946
01:30:45.253 --> 01:30:46.550
[laughing]

1947
01:30:46.621 --> 01:30:48.020
Go boogie.

1948
01:30:50.158 --> 01:30:52.149
I’m having one
hell of a time.

1949
01:30:52.227 --> 01:30:53.854
[all laughing]

1950
01:30:55.130 --> 01:30:56.392
(Claudia)
All right!

1951
01:30:57.398 --> 01:30:59.559
? In the night ?

1952
01:30:59.868 --> 01:31:02.837
[all humming]

1953
01:31:03.004 --> 01:31:05.837
Strangers in the night 

1954
01:31:06.107 --> 01:31:08.769
 [singing incoherently]

1955
01:31:10.044 --> 01:31:12.012
 [all humming]

1956
01:31:23.491 --> 01:31:24.719
Fire.

1957
01:31:25.627 --> 01:31:27.219
I’m dying for some coffee.

1958
01:31:27.295 --> 01:31:28.284
Oh. get us
some coffee.

1959
01:31:28.363 --> 01:31:30.297
Coffee! Hello!

1960
01:31:30.365 --> 01:31:32.993
[honking]
Anybody home? Coffee!

1961
01:31:34.302 --> 01:31:36.463
Come on. give us
a little smile. Come on.

1962
01:31:36.538 --> 01:31:37.732
Coffee!

1963
01:31:37.806 --> 01:31:39.068
That‘s nice.

1964
01:31:39.274 --> 01:31:40.673
[honking]

1965
01:31:41.109 --> 01:31:43.509
You trying to
get us thrown out?

1966
01:31:43.745 --> 01:31:45.269
There‘s nobody here.

1967
01:31:45.346 --> 01:31:47.314
I bet we‘re the only
people in this building.

1968
01:31:47.482 --> 01:31:48.949
Throw me the newspaper.

1969
01:31:49.717 --> 01:31:50.979
(Jack)
Want some coffee?

1970
01:31:51.052 --> 01:31:52.952
Who wants coffee?
You want coffee?

1971
01:31:54.155 --> 01:31:55.588
Danny wants coffee.

1972
01:31:55.657 --> 01:31:57.147
[laughing]

1973
01:31:57.225 --> 01:31:58.886
Danny needs
some coffee.

1974
01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.928
[singing]

1975
01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:12.932
[screaming]

1976
01:32:13.007 --> 01:32:14.269
What? What?

1977
01:32:14.342 --> 01:32:16.367
[laughing]

1978
01:32:18.546 --> 01:32:19.979
Oh. God.

1979
01:32:20.048 --> 01:32:21.345
[laughing]

1980
01:32:24.219 --> 01:32:26.380
I think Danny‘s upset.

1981
01:32:26.454 --> 01:32:28.012
Oh. he‘ll be all right.

1982
01:32:29.591 --> 01:32:32.958
We‘ve been joking
around all night
and he hasn‘t joined in.

1983
01:32:33.828 --> 01:32:36.854
I think he‘s hurt.
I think maybe we owe
him an apology.

1984
01:32:36.931 --> 01:32:38.990
What. because
I laughed at him?

1985
01:32:39.968 --> 01:32:41.993
Well. yeah.

1986
01:32:45.173 --> 01:32:46.765
Look. Ginny.

1987
01:32:47.809 --> 01:32:50.937
when people have been
friends as long as we have

1988
01:32:51.012 --> 01:32:52.912
it‘s not
such a terrible thing

1989
01:32:52.981 --> 01:32:55.381
to kid somebody
out of a depression.

1990
01:32:56.317 --> 01:32:59.684
So don‘t get upset
about what you
don‘t understand.

1991
01:33:07.495 --> 01:33:09.793
I’ve just about
had it with you people.

1992
01:33:10.465 --> 01:33:11.796
What‘s the matter?

1993
01:33:12.767 --> 01:33:14.997
I’ll tell you what‘s
the matter. I’m mad.

1994
01:33:15.069 --> 01:33:16.536
(Nick)
Ginny?

1995
01:33:17.071 --> 01:33:18.333
I fall in love
with this man.

1996
01:33:18.406 --> 01:33:20.465
and all of a sudden.
in addition to him

1997
01:33:20.541 --> 01:33:22.941
I’ve got four
constant companions!

1998
01:33:23.244 --> 01:33:25.439
I have to work out
a new relationship

1999
01:33:25.513 --> 01:33:27.276
with somebody who
is going through

2000
01:33:27.348 --> 01:33:29.976
the worst period of his life.
only I can‘t do it alone

2001
01:33:30.051 --> 01:33:32.417
I’ve got to do it in
front of four other people!

2002
01:33:32.487 --> 01:33:35.422
And it‘s not as if
my privacy was invaded.

2003
01:33:35.490 --> 01:33:37.583
you all have let me
know every single day

2004
01:33:37.659 --> 01:33:39.889
that I have been
intruding on your territory!

2005
01:33:43.231 --> 01:33:45.825
Let me tell you something.
As far as I’m concerned

2006
01:33:46.234 --> 01:33:49.431
you‘re all demanding
and unforgiving.
every single one of you.

2007
01:33:49.837 --> 01:33:52.431
Everybody is sweet
and warm and simple

2008
01:33:52.507 --> 01:33:53.940
but everybody ignores me.

2009
01:33:54.008 --> 01:33:55.669
I’m like a leper.

2010
01:33:56.644 --> 01:33:59.442
I’m--I’m a blank spot
where Anne used to be.

2011
01:34:07.021 --> 01:34:09.046
I’m going to go
take a run in the snow.

2012
01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:13.622
[door slams]

2013
01:34:13.895 --> 01:34:16.455
I hope she‘ll be
all right out there.

2014
01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:20.824
Wish I hadn‘t
said that.

2015
01:34:20.969 --> 01:34:22.231
What happened?

2016
01:34:23.271 --> 01:34:25.296
(Nick)
Ginny! Ginny!

2017
01:34:25.606 --> 01:34:26.630
I’m going after her!

2018
01:34:26.708 --> 01:34:27.732
Nick!

2019
01:34:27.976 --> 01:34:29.102
You got a broken ankle.

2020
01:34:29.177 --> 01:34:30.804
She might fall
down in the dark.

2021
01:34:30.878 --> 01:34:33.870
So what? She fell down
in the daylight.
she didn‘t hurt herself.

2022
01:34:33.948 --> 01:34:35.677
In the dark
she might hurt herself.

2023
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:37.411
Nick. she‘ll be okay.
Rest your foot.

2024
01:34:37.485 --> 01:34:40.249
(Nick)
I’m not going to run the risk
of her falling down out there.

2025
01:34:40.321 --> 01:34:42.414
(Danny)
Why not?
Because she‘s pregnant.

2026
01:34:44.158 --> 01:34:46.126
Because she‘s pregnant?

2027
01:34:47.128 --> 01:34:48.322
Watch this.

2028
01:34:48.396 --> 01:34:50.159
Here‘s some real
heartwarming acceptance.

2029
01:34:50.231 --> 01:34:53.132
You‘re 43 years old.
you‘re going to
start having babies?

2030
01:34:53.568 --> 01:34:55.195
I don‘t believe this.

2031
01:34:55.770 --> 01:34:57.328
I have to check
everything with you?

2032
01:34:57.405 --> 01:35:00.670
As a matter of fact.
I told you I wanted
to start a new family.

2033
01:35:01.075 --> 01:35:02.337
With babies?

2034
01:35:02.844 --> 01:35:04.368
With what? Airedales?

2035
01:35:05.546 --> 01:35:07.207
Look. do what you want.

2036
01:35:07.415 --> 01:35:09.975
Oh. thanks very much.
I really appreciate that.

2037
01:35:10.551 --> 01:35:12.178
Fellows. come on back inside.

2038
01:35:12.253 --> 01:35:13.447
It’s freezing out here.

2039
01:35:13.521 --> 01:35:15.386
Come on. you can‘t go
after her like that.

2040
01:35:15.456 --> 01:35:16.684
Come on.
Come on.

2041
01:35:16.758 --> 01:35:19.556
Nick. please! Come on.

2042
01:35:29.504 --> 01:35:32.098
(Nick)
It’s starting to get bright.
Where the hell is she?

2043
01:35:33.608 --> 01:35:34.973
[sighing]

2044
01:35:35.043 --> 01:35:36.305
You know.

2045
01:35:37.879 --> 01:35:40.439
when she ran out of here
I started to think of

2046
01:35:40.681 --> 01:35:42.979
all the friends
we‘ve had over the years

2047
01:35:43.051 --> 01:35:44.985
who‘ve jogged
out of our lives.

2048
01:35:46.054 --> 01:35:47.885
All the ones who‘ve. uh.

2049
01:35:48.322 --> 01:35:52.190
who‘ve been inconvenient
to stay friendly with
and it scares me.

2050
01:35:55.229 --> 01:35:58.687
They move to another state
or they‘ve gotten a divorce

2051
01:36:00.334 --> 01:36:02.894
or else we‘ve just gotten
friendly enough with them

2052
01:36:02.970 --> 01:36:05.530
to realize they‘re a kind of
a pain in the ass

2053
01:36:05.606 --> 01:36:08.006
and pretty soon we
never see them again.

2054
01:36:09.911 --> 01:36:11.845
I’ll tell you something.
Jack.

2055
01:36:13.314 --> 01:36:15.782
I don‘t want to
be one of two people

2056
01:36:15.850 --> 01:36:18.341
alone in the world
at the end of my life.

2057
01:36:20.721 --> 01:36:22.450
I want to have friends.

2058
01:36:26.027 --> 01:36:27.892
When I get old

2059
01:36:28.930 --> 01:36:31.364
I’d like you all
to still be there.

2060
01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:40.730
Okay?

2061
01:36:41.609 --> 01:36:43.600
Why can‘t we
just let them be?

2062
01:36:45.346 --> 01:36:47.280
In other words.
I’m the problem?

2063
01:36:48.049 --> 01:36:49.380
I have to have
everything my way.

2064
01:36:49.450 --> 01:36:51.748
I’m unforgiving and cold
and judgmental. right?

2065
01:36:51.819 --> 01:36:52.877
Right.

2066
01:36:52.954 --> 01:36:54.046
Right.

2067
01:36:54.122 --> 01:36:55.646
We‘re talking about me?

2068
01:36:55.890 --> 01:36:58.552
Jack. you know
those probing questions

2069
01:36:58.626 --> 01:36:59.923
you ask all the time?

2070
01:36:59.994 --> 01:37:01.518
You‘re the only
one who answers them.

2071
01:37:01.596 --> 01:37:03.461
Everybody dances to your tune!

2072
01:37:03.865 --> 01:37:05.355
That makes me
sound like a tyrant.

2073
01:37:05.433 --> 01:37:06.866
Well. so what?

2074
01:37:06.968 --> 01:37:09.596
I am not a tyrant.
Goddamn it!

2075
01:37:11.606 --> 01:37:13.540
No matter what crap
I get from people.

2076
01:37:13.608 --> 01:37:15.303
all I ever give
back is a smile.

2077
01:37:16.043 --> 01:37:18.068
I never give
a response that‘s anything

2078
01:37:18.146 --> 01:37:21.081
but fair and rational
and cheerful!

2079
01:37:22.183 --> 01:37:23.650
Be careful!
Be careful!

2080
01:37:23.718 --> 01:37:25.845
Why don‘t you
let your anger out
once in a while?

2081
01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:28.388
You want anger?
There! How‘s that?

Is that angry enough for you?

01:37:31.292 --> 01:37:32.691

What the hell you doing?

2089
01:37:41.469 --> 01:37:43.403
You know what
I expect from you.

2090
01:37:43.504 --> 01:37:45.472
I expect closeness

2091
01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:48.441
and warmth
and unconditional acceptance.

2092
01:37:48.509 --> 01:37:50.568

is secretiveness

I’m not paying for this!
This is your expense!

Yeah. bet your life!

Is that angry
enough for you. huh?

So you freaked out a little.

You‘re not the best

[Danny screaming]

2206
01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:48.563
[water bubbling]

2207
01:43:49.203 --> 01:43:52.900
How could you drive
my Mercedes on thin ice?

2208
01:43:52.973 --> 01:43:54.065
Oh!

2209

Get off
the blanket.

2213
01:44:04.585 --> 01:44:06.485
It was brand new!

2214
01:44:06.754 --> 01:44:09.484
In three years.
I could have gotten
twice what I paid for it!

2215
01:44:09.557 --> 01:44:12.321
Danny. Danny. we‘ll get
someone to fish it out
for you.

2216
01:44:12.393 --> 01:44:15.419
What the hell am I going to do
with a rusty Mercedes?

It’s gone!

2218
01:44:16.697 --> 01:44:17.789
It’s gone.

2219
01:44:17.865 --> 01:44:19.765
It sank like a stone.

2220
01:44:19.833 --> 01:44:20.993
(Claudia)
Danny!

2221

Go in. You‘re going to
freeze to death.

2225
01:44:29.677 --> 01:44:31.702
Get into
the lodge and get warm.

2226
01:44:32.246 --> 01:44:33.838
Sorry.
I just got a little crazy.

2227

I’m sorry.
What do I care about the car.

2228

2232
01:44:46.126 --> 01:44:47.286
Get back.

2233

take it on the ice?

Will you shut up.

rescue me for. anyway?

2242
01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:07.872

2243
01:45:07.948 --> 01:45:11.076
(Kate)
