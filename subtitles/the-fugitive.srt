2
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,924
Come on, Doc.

3
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,931
- You gotta stay down here.
- Yeah.

4
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,643
Check this out.

5
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,189
Prints right here.

6
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,817
<i>Reporting live from the home...</i>

7
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,360
...of Dr. Richard Kimble...

8
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,613
...a prominent surgeon
at Chicago Memorial Hospital.

9
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,115
Details are sketchy...

10
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:22,828
...but we know that Dr. Kimble's wife,
Helen, was found murdered tonight.

11
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,872
Area 6 detectives are bringing
Dr. Kimble out.

12
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:30,419
We assume they will take him
to the Area 6 police station...

13
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:35,298
...where they hope he can shed some light
on what happened tonight.

14
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,301
As I indicated,
she was found shortly before midnight.

15
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,471
We know that she made a 911 call to police...

16
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,475
...indicating that there was an intruder
or that she was being assaulted.

17
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,060
Details are very sketchy.

18
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,479
We know that he and his wife, Helen...

19
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,732
...were at the Four Seasons Hotel
earlier tonight...

20
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,694
...at a fundraiser
for the Childrens' Research Fund.

21
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,491
– Hey.
– Rich, remember Cara?

22
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,034
– Nice to see you.
– Nice to see you.

23
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,172
Straighten that arm. You'll slice.

24
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,882
Golf pro teach you that?

25
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,550
My wife.

26
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,096
Before I forget...

27
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,557
...thanks for the loaner. Keys are downstairs.

28
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,685
– Any gas in it?
– Yes. Enough.

29
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,562
Alec, Richard Kimble.

30
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,773
– How are you?
– Dr. Kimble.

31
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,858
– Guess that works too.
– Absolutely.

32
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,860
– Anytime.
– Oh, yeah.

33
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:42,449
I think that's a great idea,
getting the guys to try that project.

34
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,992
All right, knock it off.

35
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,328
There's nothing to see here.
You, come with me.

36
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,996
Excuse me.

37
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,874
Thank you. I was down to my last joke.

38
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,221
<i>You look really beautiful tonight.</i>

39
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,057
Thanks, honey.

40
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:11,645
I know you hate these things,
but I love looking at you in a tux.

41
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,065
I feel I look like a waiter.

42
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,948
- – Hello?
<i>- Dr. Kimble?</i>

43
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,200
– Yes, it is.
<i>– Sorry to bother you...</i>

44
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,912
<i>...but Dr. Stevens is in Emergency OR
and asked if you could give him a hand.</i>

45
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,208
Call him and say I'll be right there.

46
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,751
<i>– Thank you, doctor.</i>
– Yup.

47
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,670
Thank you. Good night.

48
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,423
I'll wait up for you.

49
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,093
<i>I'll wait up for you.</i>

50
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,081
<i>Talk to me. What do we got here?</i>

51
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,791
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

52
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,296
A 58-year-old. Just pulled his gallbladder.
Bleeding.

53
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,506
Big time. It's in the liver bed.

54
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,842
What are his coags?
– They're all messed up.

55
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,428
PT's 36 and the rest are off the wall.

56
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,096
Where'd he come from?

57
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,683
Lentz's name is on the chart.
We paged him, but no answer.

58
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,811
Let me in there. Give me some room.

59
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,814
Give me a clamp.

60
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,441
Give me suction.

61
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,277
<i>Have you been getting
any threats at work?</i>

62
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,238
Co-workers, hospital staff,
anything like that at all?

63
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,948
Uh....

64
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,118
– No.
– Anything unusual going on...

65
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,704
...as far as phone calls, people hanging up?

66
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,165
People coming to the door?

67
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,499
Tradespeople?

68
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,501
Not that I know of.

69
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,756
Back on this fight
with this guy with the one arm.

70
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,592
Did it happen upstairs or downstairs?

71
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,636
– Upstairs.
– Uh-huh.

72
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,513
And he had which? A right or a left arm?

73
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,850
With a gimmick on it?

74
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,810
Right arm.

75
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,271
Is it one of those with the hooks, or--

76
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,482
No, he had, like, a--

77
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,567
He had a cosmetic hand.

78
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,279
The security system in your house,
it's a pretty good one.

79
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,115
Anyone have the coding
besides you and your wife?

80
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,701
Our maid.

81
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,537
She knows the code and has a key.

82
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,624
Those scratches on your neck...

83
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,877
...did the one-armed guy do that?

84
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,506
Helen scratched me when I moved her.

85
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,801
Before or after the fight
with the one-armed guy?

86
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,387
I told you.

87
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,972
You own a gun?

88
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,141
Do you own a gun?

89
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,895
Yes, we have one in the house.

90
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,480
It's in your name?

91
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,731
Yes.

92
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,984
Where do you usually keep that gun?

93
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,027
The one that you own.

94
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,071
It's in Helen's table.

95
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,240
Bedside table.

96
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,993
Do you keep much jewelry in the house?

97
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,494
Uno.

98
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,997
His fingerprints are all over the lamp...

99
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,375
...the gun and the bullets...

100
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,920
...and the good doctor's skin
is under her fingernails.

101
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,424
Your wife's got the money in the family,
hasn't she?

102
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,344
Helen comes from a wealthy family, yes.

103
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,180
Is she insured?

104
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,183
Yes, she is.

105
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,602
Who's the beneficiary?

106
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,067
– I am.
– The sole beneficiary?

107
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,194
Yes.

108
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:52,282
Financially,
you won't be hurting after this, will you?

109
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,785
She was worth a lot of money.

110
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,124
Are you suggesting that I killed my wife?

111
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:06,045
Are you saying that I crushed her skull
and shot her?

112
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,049
How dare you!

113
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,302
When I came home,
there was a man in my house.

114
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,179
– I fought with him.
– Uh-huh.

115
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,223
– The one-armed man.
– He had a mechanical arm.

116
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,809
– Plastic? Rubber?
– Find this man!

117
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,728
You find this man!

118
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,688
How tall?

119
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,607
He took everything from me.

120
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,108
Oh, Jesus.

121
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,777
What did he weigh?

122
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,487
What color was his hair?

123
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,072
What color were his eyes?

124
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,995
We can't help you if you don't help us.

125
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,789
Book him.

126
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,707
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

127
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:47,253
...you will hear iron-clad proof
of Richard Kimble's guilt.

128
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,883
Indisputable scientific evidence...

129
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,636
...that on the night of January 20...

130
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,347
...Richard Kimble did viciously...

131
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,851
...attack...

132
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,562
...and brutally murder his wife.

133
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,441
You'll hear more than that.

134
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,611
You will hear a voice from the grave.

135
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,114
The voice of Helen Kimble
identifying her killer...

136
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,535
...her husband, Richard Kimble.

137
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,287
Detective Kelly...

138
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:25,792
...tell us what you saw at the victim's home
on the night of the murder.

139
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,669
No forcible entry was found.

140
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:33,508
<i>From the beginning of the investigation,
it didn't appear to be a break-in.</i>

141
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,218
<i>Nothing was missing.</i>

142
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,430
I'm home.

143
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,058
Who won the game?

144
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,853
His prints were on the gun and bullets.

145
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,897
<i>No other sets were found,
other than the housekeeper's...</i>

146
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,482
<i>...and the deceased's.</i>

147
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:56,573
Mrs. Kimble's skull fracture caused
a massive hemorrhage to the brain.

148
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,159
It took less than 5 minutes for her to die.

149
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:20,013
Your Honor, we'd ask to play
Helen Kimble's 911 emergency call...

150
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:24,100
...previously identified
by the Chicago Police Dispatcher.

151
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,312
<i>Emergency 911.</i>

152
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,105
Please help me.

153
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,317
<i>What seems to be the problem?</i>

154
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,071
<i>He's here still, in the house.</i>

155
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,907
<i>Did I hear you right?</i>

156
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,158
<i>Someone's in your house?</i>

157
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,621
<i>He's trying to kill me.</i>

158
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,623
<i>Could you repeat that?</i>

159
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,542
<i>Ma'am?</i>

160
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,545
<i>He's trying to kill me.</i>

161
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,923
<i>Ma'am?</i>

162
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,800
<i>Is your attacker still in the house?</i>

163
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,892
- Richard....
<i>- Ma'am?</i>

164
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,477
Richard....

165
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,814
He's trying to kill me.

166
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,200
Mr. Kimble...

167
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:26,537
...having considered all the aggravation
and mitigation in this case...

168
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:31,501
...and found the offense was brutal
and indicative of wanton cruelty...

169
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:36,464
...it's this court's judgment that you be
remanded to Illinois State Penitentiary...

170
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:40,510
...where you will await
execution by lethal injection...

171
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,931
...on a date to be set forth
by the attorney general of this state.

172
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,684
May God have mercy on your soul.

173
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,253
- Carlson.
- Here.

174
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,005
- Partida.
- Yeah.

175
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,715
Copeland.
– What?

176
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,217
You be nice now.

177
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,386
Kimble.

178
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,222
Yeah.

179
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,146
Let's go, gentlemen.

180
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,648
Four prisoners conning out.

181
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,694
<i>Prisoners coming up.</i>

182
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,672
Let's go, gentlemen.

183
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,594
Kimble, you're here.

184
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,098
Carlson, right over there.

185
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,351
Partida, up front left.

186
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,604
Copeland, you're back here with me.

187
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,442
Make yourselves comfortable.

188
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,029
You know the routine, gentlemen.

189
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,309
I'm tired.

190
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,399
Twenty miles from Menard.

191
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,317
We'll be there in about 40 minutes.

192
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,739
I'll be glad to get rid of this load.
Let McKenzie take care of them.

193
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,785
I hope he's got something
good to eat there. I'm starving.

194
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,412
Me too.

195
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,082
Had enough prison chow.

196
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:22,588
Old Ed, he don't care.
His old lady's got him on a diet.

197
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,215
Right, Ed?

198
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,686
Get in here, quick!

199
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,441
He's getting sick! Move!

200
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,235
- – He's foaming at the mouth.
- We're almost at the prison.

201
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,820
He's choking!

202
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,074
Wait!

203
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,831
Ah!

204
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,840
Oh, shit!

205
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,052
Kimble!

206
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,888
Get over here.
You're a doctor, do something!

207
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,933
Unlock me. Unlock me!

208
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,144
Here.

209
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,355
You'll be okay.

210
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:09,946
What the hell is that?

211
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,618
Shit!
– Ah!

212
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,164
Give me a hand with this man.

213
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,832
The hell with you.

214
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,751
Copeland, help me with this man!

215
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,754
Kiss my ass, Doc.

216
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,271
Listen....

217
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,525
I don't care which way you go.

218
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,027
Just don't follow me. Got that?

219
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,487
Yeah.

220
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,406
Hey, Copeland.

221
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:00,866
Be good.

222
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,534
My, my, my, my.
What a mess.

223
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,453
It's a circus.

224
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,041
You got my bag?

225
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,962
Point of impact right here.

226
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,384
The first engine uncoupled,
the rest of the train jumped the track.

227
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,136
– About 100 yards?
– Yeah.

228
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,762
You must get new boots.

229
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,431
I told you not to wear the heels.

230
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,932
I want you to wear two coats.

231
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,434
Next train wreck.

232
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,144
Why do we always mother her?

233
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,395
Because she loves us.

234
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:15,566
- How'd you like to be the driver?
- I bet he did a Casey Jones.

235
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,318
Hold it, sir.

236
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,861
Who's in charge?

237
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,905
– Sheriff Rawlins.
– Rawlins.

238
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:24,033
– Just follow the TV lights.
– Good, good.

239
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,534
Sheriff Rogers.

240
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:26,827
Rawlins.

241
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,627
- – Look down there and take Newman.
- Right.

242
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,837
Time to go to work.

243
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:41,801
The bus rolled over several times
before settling down the hill.

244
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,220
I don't know if I passed out...

245
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:48,432
...but when I looked up,
the train was bearing down on us. Fast.

246
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,852
I don't know how. It's still kind of hazy.

247
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,648
I grabbed him and pushed him
out of the bus.

248
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,901
– You're brave, you could've been killed.
– I know.

249
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,612
He's my partner.
He'd have done the same for me.

250
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:05,574
Excuse me, I'm Deputy U.S. Marshal
Samuel Gerard, I'd like to--

251
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:09,703
– I'll be with you in a minute.
– Okay.

252
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,372
Again, just for the record...

253
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,666
– ...these three are dead?
– Yeah.

254
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,126
And this one?

255
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,296
Everything happened so fast.

256
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,383
I don't think he made it.

257
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,970
You came a long way for nothing.

258
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,180
With all due respect, sheriff...

259
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:31,100
...I'd like to recommend checkpoints
on a 15-mile radius...

260
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,310
...at I-57, I-24 and over here on Route--

261
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,187
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

262
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:37,606
Wait. The prisoners are all dead.

263
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:42,444
Checkpoints will get people frantic
and they'll flood my office with calls.

264
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,114
Shit, I'd hate to see that happen...

265
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,075
...so I'll take over your investigation.

266
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,119
You just....

267
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,662
On what authority?

268
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,289
The Governor...

269
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,207
...the U.S. Marshal's office...

270
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,001
...5th District, Northern Illinois.

271
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:02,339
All right, you want jurisdiction over this mess,
you got it.

272
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,633
Okay, boys, gather around and listen.

273
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,511
We're shutting it down.
Wyatt Earp's here to mop up--

274
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,139
That's very funny, Wyatt Earp.

275
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,267
– Sam.
– Oh, wow, gee whiz. Look here!

276
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:21,400
We're always fascinated when we find
leg irons with no legs in them.

277
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:24,403
– Who held the key, sir?
– Me.

278
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:25,946
Where are they?

279
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,573
I don't know.

280
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,826
– Care to revise your statement, sir?
– What?

281
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,621
Do you want to change
your bullshit story, sir?

282
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,376
– He might've got out.
– He might've got out.

283
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,920
You said he was part of the wreckage!

284
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,007
Set up operations by the fire truck.
Listen, everyone!

285
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:48,010
A fugitive has been on the run
for 90 minutes.

286
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:52,348
Average foot speed over uneven ground,
barring injury, is four miles an hour.

287
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,683
That gives us a radius of six miles.

288
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:02,358
What I want from each of you
is a hard target search of every gas station...

289
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,945
...residence, warehouse, farmhouse,
hen house, outhouse...

290
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,822
...and doghouse in that area.

291
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,575
Checkpoints go up at 15 miles.

292
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,622
Your fugitive's name is Dr. Richard Kimble.

293
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,251
Go get him.

294
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:37,619
Don't give me shit.

295
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:40,622
I got three very unhappy dead people.
Put him on.

296
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,791
Stevens, it's Cosmo.

297
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,711
I'll have a satellite telephone
hook up in two seconds.

298
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,422
Police just found a blood trail...

299
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,632
– ...two miles southwest.
– Robert.

300
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:53,177
Yo.
– Match that blood against the prisoners'.

301
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,595
– Right.
– Renfro.

302
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,056
– Yo.
– Get a fax I.D. on Kimble...

303
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,807
...to every local hospital.

304
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,018
Follow that with troopers.

305
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,937
Newman.

306
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,939
– Yes.
– What are you doing?

307
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,733
I'm thinking.

308
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:11,570
Think me up some coffee and a doughnut
with sprinkles on top...

309
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,113
...as long as you're thinking.

310
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,240
We got a live body!

311
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,909
A live one?

312
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:25,584
Hang in there, brother.
We'll get you out of here.

313
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:29,004
- Got it?
- I got it. All right

314
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,465
Get that ambulance down here!

315
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,867
Is this what you want?

316
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,743
That's it.

317
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,537
I'll make copies.

318
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:11,648
Good morning, Mr. Johnson.
I have your breakfast for you.

319
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,610
We're thirsty today, aren't we?

320
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,154
Eat up before it gets cold.

321
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:25,329
It really gets dry in here, doesn't it?

322
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,585
Here you are.

323
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,629
Now, eat something.

324
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,589
You need your strength.

325
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,508
Shit.

326
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:25,931
Doc, we're looking for a prisoner
from that wreck. Might be hurt.

327
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,683
What does he look like?

328
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,560
Six-one, 180, brown hair, brown eyes, beard.

329
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,437
Seen anyone like that around?

330
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,648
Every time I look in the mirror.

331
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,650
Except for the beard, of course.

332
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:37,901
Doc!

333
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,362
Yeah?

334
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,659
Thanks.

335
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,092
- – I'll give you a hand.
- Thanks, doc.

336
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,302
It's....

337
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,805
How is he?

338
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,766
Good, considering we dug him out
from under a train.

339
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,937
Tell the attending he's got a puncture
in the upper gastric area.

340
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,898
How could he tell that
by looking at his face?

341
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:28,618
Background just came in from Chicago.

342
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,121
About time. What've we got?

343
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,958
"Richard David Kimble, vascular surgeon."
What's that?

344
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,836
Somebody that makes more money than you.

345
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,922
"Convicted of 1st-degree
murder of his wife.

346
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:44,092
Pleaded innocent.
Says a one-armed man did it."

347
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,594
Lots of friends.

348
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,138
Doctors, hospital staff.

349
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:51,725
We'll start there. I want phone taps.
First, his lawyer.

350
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,393
Whoa, you'll never get that.

351
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,188
Call Judge Rubin.
Tell him I want phone taps.

352
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,981
Why are you yelling at me?

353
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,192
I'll tell him on who later
if I'm in a good mood.

354
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,860
– Why not yell at her sometimes?
– Sam.

355
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,946
– What?
– We got a call from the hospital.

356
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,783
The wounded guard swears
he saw Kimble there.

357
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,034
That's hot.

358
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,577
And an ambulance is missing.

359
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,205
Where's he going in an ambulance?

360
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,638
Sam!

361
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,059
Sam, ambulance just spotted...

362
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:38,480
...two miles west of Doverville,
heading north, State Highway 53.

363
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,190
Running out of map!

364
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,497
Get your maps out.

365
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,375
Check, sound check. Get your maps out.

366
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,591
I want to know all routes in and out of town.

367
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:22,691
We're headed north on Route 13,
toward the Barkley Dam.

368
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,025
Son of a bitch!

369
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,076
Don't lose that ambulance.

370
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,551
Visual location of an ambulance headed north
on Route 13 toward Barkley Dam.

371
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,761
We'll pass through a viaduct.

372
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:59,144
Get on the horn. Bring Biggs
and Newman in from south of the viaduct.

373
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,687
He's hauling ass.

374
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:09,946
Is there a tunnel between here and there?
We have Biggs and Newman?

375
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,951
Look on your map to know how to get there.

376
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,396
We got him!

377
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,625
Watch out! Watch out!

378
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,090
– What's going on?
– Get back in your car, sir!

379
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,262
Newman! Rock and roll!

380
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,273
Put a light in there!

381
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:28,692
Put a light in there!

382
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,318
What do you got?

383
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,237
I got nothing.

384
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:35,323
– Talk to me. What do you got?
– You must be kidding me!

385
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:38,159
– What--?
– You must be kidding me!

386
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:46,793
Seal off the tunnel! Seal it off!

387
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,606
We got a gopher.

388
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:25,248
Shit! I just bought these shoes.

389
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,334
Shut up, Cosmo.

390
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,169
Which way, Sam?

391
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,965
Ah!

392
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,820
I didn't kill my wife!

393
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,531
I don't care!

394
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,585
Put that gun down!

395
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,422
Put that gun down!

396
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,758
Now!

397
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,260
Hands up!

398
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,720
Over your head!

399
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:27,639
Turn around!

400
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,893
Do you want to get shot?

401
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,734
Pay attention!

402
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:41,903
Get down on your knees!

403
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,947
Right now!

404
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,967
Sam!
– Yo.

405
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,681
What happened? Where'd he go?

406
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,350
He did a Peter Pan right off this dam!

407
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,018
Right here!

408
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:15,979
Down! Boom!

409
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:18,106
Holy shit!

410
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,442
Can we go home now?

411
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,736
No. No.

412
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,072
Holy shit!

413
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,122
– There's no way out of here.
– Down that way.

414
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:38,084
- Down that way.
- No, no. Go up. Go up!

415
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,545
Go up the stairs! Up, up!

416
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,631
Get them down here now.
Helicopters, divers!

417
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,554
Have that water turned off. Come over here.

418
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,891
Put two cars on that bridge down there
and four patrolmen.

419
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,810
Have them glass this river
upstream and down.

420
00:39:56,019 --> 00:40:00,815
I want a helicopter 100 feet off this
river. Make him aware of these wires.

421
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,984
Are you crazy? He's dead!

422
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,153
That'll make him easy to catch.

423
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,573
I want hounds on both banks of this
river for 2 miles...

424
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,117
...upstream and downstream.

425
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,787
– You've got a search-and-rescue team?
– Yeah, we do.

426
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,874
Get them down here
and drag the bottom of this spillway.

427
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:22,003
– Why isn't the water turned off?
– Somebody from County's working on it.

428
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,340
Hurry it up. They're running out of daylight.

429
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,002
No. Bring in the helicopter now.

430
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,879
We're out of here!

431
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:07,382
I don't think there's anything to find.

432
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,635
Find it anyway.
You've got lights and generators coming.

433
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:40,248
– I won't tell you how to do your job...
– Put the helicopter on the bridge!

434
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:45,003
...but only one in a million could survive
that fall. He's fish food!

435
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,964
Get a cane pole and catch
the fish that ate him.

436
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,634
Get Stevens.
Tell him we're on the way in.

437
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,237
<i>That man took everything from me.</i>

438
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,660
We can't find the guy.

439
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,331
<i>We can't find the guy.</i>

440
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,127
<i>You find that man!</i>

441
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,762
<i>You find that man!</i>

442
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,472
<i>Find that man!</i>

443
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,438
The generators
and searchlights are there now.

444
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,108
They'll continue the search into the night.

445
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,278
Good. Call Kentucky
and thank them for the dogs.

446
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,614
Remember,
opera ain't over until the Big Dog howls.

447
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,595
Need a ride?

448
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:43,658
Check it again.

449
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,954
All right, we got him.
He shacked up with some babe in Whiting.

450
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,790
She left work tonight and took him home.

451
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:55,544
– About 2 hours ago, her boss said.
– They spotted her car outside her house.

452
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,797
Does she run with anyone?

453
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,383
No one we could find. No family either.

454
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:05,388
Tell the police not to move till we get there.
We'll go early in the morning.

455
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,223
– Your cousin still got his truck?
– Mm-hm.

456
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,849
Tell him we need it.

457
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:31,706
– Be drunk, Newman.
– Yeah.

458
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:34,292
Stay close.

459
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:37,044
Right on your ass, bud.

460
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,054
I don't want you getting lost.
Stick with me.

461
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:02,611
U.S. Marshals! Everybody down!

462
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,243
- – Ah!
- Hold it right there!

463
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:11,245
Show me those hands!
Give me those hands.

464
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,542
Keep them up!

465
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,841
Get your ass in there.

466
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:27,261
I got your man!
I got your man, you hear me?

467
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,890
I want out of here!

468
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,767
I got your man!

469
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:34,935
I got your man!

470
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,774
I'm going to blow his brains out!
I want out of here!

471
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,193
Do you hear me, cops?

472
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,236
Do you hear me?

473
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:45,946
I want out of here!

474
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:50,326
- – Listen! We can work this out!
- Yes, we can.

475
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,662
- – Shut up! Shut up!
- Listen to me.

476
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,539
Do you hear me?

477
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:59,001
Listen, and I'll tell you what I want.

478
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,045
I want a car out front.

479
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:08,052
– Don't shoot.
– It's over.

480
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:31,867
Shut up.

481
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,612
I can't hear anything. My ears....

482
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,450
I can't believe you did that.

483
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,455
You think I should've bargained with him.

484
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,083
Yeah.

485
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,543
I do.

486
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,879
You could've missed.

487
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,548
– You could've killed me.
– Yeah.

488
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,552
How bad is that ear?

489
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,680
Terrible. I'll have permanent damage.

490
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:35,973
Let me see it.

491
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,017
Come here.

492
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,269
Can you hear me now?

493
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,354
Yeah.

494
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,482
I don't...

495
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,860
...bargain.

496
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,237
You hear that?

497
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,740
Yeah.

498
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,576
Good.

499
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:39,495
Walter, this is Richard.

500
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:43,791
<i>Jesus! Why did you run?
It only makes you look guilty.</i>

501
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,669
I wasn't worried about appearances.

502
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:50,172
<i>Tell me where you are,
so I can meet you and you can surrender.</i>

503
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,758
I won't surrender. I need help, money.

504
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:58,347
Richard, you're asking me to aid
a convicted felon. I can't help you that way.

505
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:02,601
<i>My advice as your friend and attorney
is to give yourself up.</i>

506
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,062
<i>Now tell me, where are you?</i>

507
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:07,064
St. Louis.

508
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:10,150
<i>Give me an address.
I'll get there as soon as I can.</i>

509
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:19,660
Mr. Copeland was a bad man.
He was going to kill one of my kids.

510
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,831
You can blame me. I'm the one that shot him.

511
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,923
Raymonds, take care of that.

512
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:34,800
<i>...give yourself up.</i>

513
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:37,177
<i>Now tell me, where are you?</i>

514
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:38,721
<i>St. Louis.</i>

515
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,724
So he's not dead.
Let that be a lesson to you.

516
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,810
Don't ever argue with the Big Dog.
Big Dog is always right.

517
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,938
You been right before.

518
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:50,232
All right.

519
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:53,068
<i>- Walter, this is Richard.</i>
<i>- Richard, Jesus.</i>

520
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,321
<i>Why did you run?
It only makes you look guilty.</i>

521
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,616
<i>I wasn't worried about appearances.</i>

522
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:02,286
<i>Tell me where you are,
so I can meet you and you can surrender.</i>

523
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,913
<i>I won't surrender. I need help, money.</i>

524
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,583
That train sounds like an El.

525
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,626
St. Louis doesn't have an elevated train.

526
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,962
How do you know it's an elevated train?

527
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:14,298
I lived under an El for 20 years.

528
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:19,178
Explain the difference between the sound
of an El and a train on the ground.

529
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,679
You must have ears
like an eagle.

530
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:24,350
Play that back.
I want to hear the sound of an elevated train.

531
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,894
What cities have Els? New York does.

532
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,354
– Philly.
– We do.

533
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,855
Milwaukee.

534
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:33,359
Hold it right there where the lawyer says
he sounds guilty. There's bells.

535
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:37,154
There's a guy on a P.A.
Can you drop everything but him?

536
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:38,405
I'll try.

537
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:39,656
Okay.

538
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,743
<i>– Walter, this is Richard.
– Richard.</i>

539
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,328
Right there.

540
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,455
What's he saying?

541
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:49,750
Sounds like, "Next stop." Do that again!

542
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:54,129
<i>– Next stop...</i>
– "Next stop"....

543
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:57,091
<i>– ...Merchandise Mart.</i>
– "Merchandise Mart."

544
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,468
Son of a bitch. The boy came home.

545
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:03,013
That bell is on the Wells Street bridge,
six blocks away.

546
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:05,808
I knew it was an elevated train.

547
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,352
Yeah, Big Dog. You're never wrong.

548
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,522
– I'll call the C.P.D.
– This is his Chicago file.

549
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,818
When I die, I want to come back like you.

550
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,152
Happy and handsome?

551
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:19,738
- – I'll notify the press.
- No press.

552
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:21,490
Right, no press.

553
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,579
Chicago.

554
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,261
– Hi, Billy.
– How's it going, sir?

555
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,471
– Good, and you?
– All right.

556
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,102
Here you go. See you.

557
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,784
Spare change? Dollar, Mister?

558
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:09,538
No, thank you very much. I don't want it.

559
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:10,831
No, I....

560
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,835
Oh, my God. Richard!

561
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,795
How are you, Charlie?

562
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,297
Jesus, you're back.

563
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,548
I need money.

564
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:21,300
Sure. Get in.

565
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,052
No, I can't. Whatever you got on you.

566
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,555
You're hot. If not now, you will be.

567
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:29,683
Have you got a place to stay?
How can I help you?

568
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,854
The light is green. Move!

569
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,105
I'll call you.

570
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:38,567
Yeah, but Rich--

571
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:48,452
<i>Why did Kimble kill his wife?</i>

572
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,870
For the money.

573
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:52,748
For the money? He's a doctor.
He's already rich.

574
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,208
She was more rich.

575
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:58,253
– Is this the entire Chicago police file?
– Yeah.

576
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:01,173
That's everything.
– I want to do all the interviews again.

577
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:04,176
The list of hospital staff is there?

578
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,220
– Sure is.
– Thank you.

579
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,013
You don't want to use the media?

580
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:12,893
We want him to relax. Make himself
comfortable. Try to re-enter his life.

581
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:19,191
Here's the apartment.

582
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:22,611
You can see here is heater.
You will have warm.

583
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,030
Here is kitchen. Sink.

584
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:28,075
Over there is bathroom.
And here is the room.

585
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,868
Is nice bed.

586
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,453
Plenty space.

587
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,080
You can look at.

588
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,230
You like the place?

589
00:55:58,438 --> 00:55:59,731
It's okay?

590
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,526
It's perfect.

591
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,319
All right, people.

592
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:08,490
This morning we were notified
by the Marshal's office...

593
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:13,370
...that our old friend Dr. Richard Kimble
is alive and well and back in Chicago.

594
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:17,499
You know in what high regard
we hold this scumbag.

595
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:21,003
I'm personally donating a bottle
of 12-year-old Scotch...

596
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,380
...to whoever collars this quack.

597
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,049
Dick Rosetti's passing out bulletins.

598
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,393
– Gunshot wound to the left shoulder.
– What are his vitals?

599
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:21,521
120 over 60. 98 pulse.

600
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:48,924
Help you?

601
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,810
You went to medical school together?

602
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:25,479
Yes, we did.

603
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,898
The class of '73.

604
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:30,609
Do you know Morton Feinberg?

605
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,694
– I do.
– He's a real nice guy.

606
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,030
When did you see him last?

607
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,531
– Who, Richard?
– Yeah.

608
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:40,368
I saw Richard this morning.

609
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,788
– What?
– This morning?

610
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,123
He stopped my car. I gave him money.

611
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:46,750
Uh-huh.

612
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,293
Where was this?

613
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:51,088
Outside my tennis club.

614
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,339
Did he ask for help?

615
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,675
I volunteered. He wouldn't accept that.

616
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:57,260
How much did you give him?

617
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:59,930
Oh, couple of bucks. What I had on me.

618
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:03,266
– He won't get far on that.
– Why'd he come back to Chicago?

619
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:04,976
He didn't tell me.

620
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:09,439
I'm sure he's trying to protect you
from having to lie for him, but....

621
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:16,154
Dr. Nichols. You really want
to be his friend and help him?

622
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:18,406
Help us bring him in unharmed.

623
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,575
Why?

624
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,786
So he can go back to prison?

625
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,875
If you want help, gentlemen,
you've come to the wrong man.

626
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,461
Richard is innocent.

627
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:34,339
You'll never find him. He's too smart.

628
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:37,300
– We're some smart guys.
– What about us?

629
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:39,678
– Last time I looked.
– We're smart. We are.

630
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:42,222
How smart could he be, really?

631
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,099
Is he as smart as you?

632
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,060
Smarter.

633
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,122
Peripheral vascular surgery.

634
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,708
Fixing arteries as they come out of the heart.

635
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:13,670
– How long have you known Richard Kimble?
– Ten years. Since I've been here.

636
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:19,718
What kind of medicine did he practice
at the hospital?

637
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:44,993
I want you to know that I believe
Richard Kimble to be innocent.

638
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:46,578
Would he seek your help?

639
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:48,872
If he did, I'd help him.

640
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,999
But he wouldn't come to me.

641
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,459
That's not his style.

642
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,561
<i>A warrant remains outstanding...</i>

643
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:14,147
<i>...for Chicago surgeon Richard Kimble.</i>

644
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:32,999
This is where the one-armed guy
and he struggled and fell down the stairs.

645
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:40,173
I fell down these stairs, I'd be a goner.
I'd be dead.

646
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,269
What a waste.

647
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,446
<i>When I came home,
there was a man in my house.</i>

648
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:30,724
Richard.

649
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:46,406
Police!

650
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,706
- Police. We're the police!
- Where is he?

651
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,425
Get him, get him!

652
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,094
Hold it!

653
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:15,810
– Freeze!
– Get down. Where you going?

654
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,482
It's over.

655
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:26,446
You like stringing out 12-year-old girls?

656
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:28,323
What are you doing with my baby?

657
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,533
Your baby's a drug dealer, lady.

658
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,285
– What he--?
– Come on, ma'am.

659
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,455
What they doing to my baby?

660
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,818
It will be crazy here tonight.
Did they get a count?

661
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:07,403
A lot of kids.

662
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:09,572
They bring them all here?

663
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:11,616
All coming to County.

664
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:33,972
– Hi.
– Hi, hi, hi.

665
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:38,226
– I've come to do those blinds.
– Okay.

666
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:39,894
I'll get the door.

667
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:53,700
– I'll start in here, huh?
– Oh, okay.

668
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,290
Let's go over it once more.

669
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:26,376
What time did he arrive at the house?

670
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,836
About 10:30 in the morning.

671
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:32,882
– He was alone?
– Yeah, he was alone.

672
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:35,843
– You got a good look at him?
– Yeah, really good.

673
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:38,721
You better be straight with me.

674
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,141
This is the guy
staying in your mother's basement?

675
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:44,269
That's what I'm telling you.

676
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:02,120
- – Is she stable?
- Just barely.

677
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:05,498
Just breathe, stay calm.
– I need a doctor over here!

678
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:14,132
Watch the bag! Watch the bag!

679
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:22,140
Call vascular and ortho
and call her parents for consent.

680
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:24,183
Okay, thank you, doctor.

681
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:28,354
Hurts.

682
01:08:32,984 --> 01:08:35,278
Hello, Marshal. It's right there.

683
01:09:05,016 --> 01:09:06,351
My chest hurts.

684
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:12,732
Check the film on that kid.

685
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:17,028
Take a deep breath.

686
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,530
Inhale, exhale. Again.

687
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:20,865
Slowly.

688
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,160
Check the film.

689
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:28,373
- Take it easy.
- It hurts.

690
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:29,916
Check the film.

691
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:32,835
What's the status on that kid?

692
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:34,420
Possible fractured sternum. Stable.

693
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:35,880
I need you here.

694
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:40,968
Can you help us?
Bring this kid to Observation Room 2.

695
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:44,180
Yeah, you. Help us out, okay?

696
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,273
How are you, champ?

697
01:09:54,482 --> 01:09:55,775
My chest hurts.

698
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:58,611
Yeah? Does it hurt when you breathe?

699
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,196
Yes.

700
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,449
That's good. That's good.

701
01:10:04,492 --> 01:10:06,661
- What's your name?
- Joel.

702
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:13,751
Look at this.

703
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:16,712
We're eating oranges and making IDs.

704
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:18,840
"C.C.H." What's that?

705
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:21,426
Cook County Hospital.

706
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:26,347
Just hang on, okay?

707
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:29,225
– It hurts.
– You'll be okay, pal.

708
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:30,810
You'll be fine.

709
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:32,770
Hold that elevator.

710
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:34,188
Thank you.

711
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:39,485
How're you doing?

712
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:41,362
My chest hurts.

713
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:43,489
Where's your mom?

714
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:44,741
I don't know.

715
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:46,784
Is she at home?

716
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:48,911
I think she's with my brother.

717
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,329
They downstairs?

718
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:52,373
I don't know.

719
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,333
Don't worry.

720
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:56,127
We'll find her.

721
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:59,756
Do you play football? Baseball?

722
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,382
Football.

723
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:04,469
Hold on, son.

724
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,104
Uh....

725
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:17,565
Hey, doctor.

726
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:20,818
They sent this one from downstairs.

727
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:30,912
Bob, get this one into Room 4, stat.

728
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:33,080
Bye-bye, Joel.

729
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,970
Where's that boy I sent down
with the janitor?

730
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:50,056
– What boy?
– The one with the fractured sternum.

731
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:51,724
He never came here.

732
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:55,353
– He didn't?
– No, he didn't.

733
01:11:57,855 --> 01:12:02,151
Hey, you have a particular interest
in our patient's X-rays?

734
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:05,696
– What do you mean?
– I saw you looking at that boy's chest film.

735
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:09,617
– It's a hobby of mine.
– A hobby, really?

736
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:12,495
– Yeah.
– What's your other hobby, brain surgery?

737
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:15,164
– What do you want?
– To know how that boy got to surgery.

738
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:17,500
I'm a janitor. I do as I'm told.

739
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:20,002
Bullshit. Who changed those orders?

740
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:22,838
I don't know what you mean.

741
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:27,927
Stay there.

742
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:31,806
Maureen, call security!

743
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:35,685
Hey!

744
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:37,937
Hey!

745
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:41,440
Excuse me.

746
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:04,171
Tell Stevens to get hold
of that guy Kelly over at C.P.D.

747
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:10,303
A guy disguised as a janitor orders
an emergency medical procedure...

748
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:13,222
...and all you did
was take away his ID card?

749
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:18,019
No. I called Security.
He took off down the hall. What was I to do?

750
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:19,645
Listen, Mr.--

751
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:21,022
Deputy.

752
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:22,565
Gerard.

753
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,401
I'm really tired.

754
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:26,986
I'd like to go home.

755
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:30,865
– Okay. How's the boy doing?
– He saved his life.

756
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,371
Thank you.

757
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:44,795
"Desmondo Jose Ruiz."

758
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,175
Whoa.

759
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:51,177
Where are you, Desmondo?

760
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:55,306
Sammy, this is my problem:

761
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:58,601
– The place is crawling with cops, right?
– Yeah.

762
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:01,020
Everybody's looking for Kimble, right?

763
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,105
So why would he be stupid enough...

764
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:05,816
...to hang out in the trauma ward
and play Mother Teresa?

765
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:07,735
– Excuse me.
– Yeah, sorry.

766
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,046
Have a problem?

767
01:14:27,254 --> 01:14:30,549
– No.
– No, no problem at all.

768
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:39,975
Excuse me, could we have a word with you?

769
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:45,898
This is Dr. Elway at Cook County Hospital.

770
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:52,196
I'm following-up for the Prosthetic Clinic
on Matthew Zelick.

771
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:54,990
Oh, he did?

772
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,659
I'm terribly sorry.

773
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:01,872
Right or left?

774
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:03,374
Right.

775
01:15:04,959 --> 01:15:07,878
- – Age?
- 35 to 45.

776
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:11,674
This is Ted Riley
with the High School Reunion Committee.

777
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:14,552
25 years is just around the corner...

778
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:18,389
...and Clive is on our list
of missing in action.

779
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:21,809
Information gave me a number,
but when I tried it....

780
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:24,562
Oh.

781
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:27,273
No kidding.

782
01:15:27,982 --> 01:15:29,400
Armed robbery?

783
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:32,528
He's where?

784
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:34,739
- – Point of attachment?
Mid-humerus.

785
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:37,324
That gives us 47 possibles.

786
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,118
- – 47?
- Robert.

787
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:42,037
Cross-check these people
for criminal records.

788
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:43,247
Wait a minute.

789
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:56,594
Happy St. Patrick's Day to all.

790
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:35,800
How you doing?

791
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:38,219
– Hey.
– What's happening?

792
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:43,974
Driscoll, Clive R.

793
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:47,728
One-armed man, armed robbery.
That's funny.

794
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:49,772
Let me ask a question:

795
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:57,446
If they can dye a river green today...

796
01:16:57,655 --> 01:17:00,157
...why can't they dye it blue the other days?

797
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:01,408
Do I know?

798
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:06,664
– Are you Irish, sir?
– Who, me? No.

799
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:08,290
Are you?

800
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:10,000
No, man.

801
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:20,928
Name of inmate?

802
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:23,097
Clive Driscoll.

803
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:24,723
Driscoll, Clive.

804
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:26,392
ID, please.

805
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,477
Driscoll, Clive R.

806
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:30,354
2-0-1-0.

807
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:34,400
Be advised that, by court ruling,
your conversation can be recorded.

808
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:40,865
This is hinky. He went to college.
He wouldn't go through all this security...

809
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:45,411
...go to lock-up to find someone
his own people say doesn't exist.

810
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:48,080
– Hinky.
– What does that mean, "hinky?"

811
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:49,415
– Strange.
– Weird.

812
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:52,042
Say "strange" or "weird."
"Hinky" has no meaning.

813
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:53,294
Well, we say "hinky."

814
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:59,049
I don't want you using meaningless words
around me. I'm taking the stairs.

815
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:03,095
How about "bullshit"?
How about "bullshit," Sam?

816
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:07,850
Visitor for Driscoll.

817
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:10,895
Come on, let's go, let's go.

818
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:15,900
Over there.

819
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:40,424
Let's go, Driscoll.

820
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,515
You got 5 minutes.

821
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:50,392
Who are you?

822
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:53,729
Look, I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

823
01:18:53,938 --> 01:18:55,397
You got me down here...

824
01:18:55,606 --> 01:18:57,274
...might as well talk.

825
01:18:57,483 --> 01:19:00,611
Down here you got no entertainment.
Ain't no cable here.

826
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:05,449
I wish I could, but I can't. Sorry.

827
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:57,710
Richard!

828
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:05,027
Officer, a man in a blue coat is waving a gun
and screaming at a woman.

829
01:21:05,235 --> 01:21:06,320
Stop that man!

830
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,030
He's a U.S. Marshal! Let him go!

831
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:12,034
Let him go! U.S. Marshall, let him go!

832
01:21:12,242 --> 01:21:13,410
Shut the gates!

833
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:30,219
Hold it.

834
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:50,114
Open the doors!

835
01:21:58,705 --> 01:22:00,082
We're on the roof.

836
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:01,625
We're on the roof.

837
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:04,586
Take some men! Look down there!

838
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:06,672
He's in the plaza!

839
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,382
He's heading east!

840
01:22:08,966 --> 01:22:10,300
– East through the plaza?
– Where?

841
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:13,303
– Towards the Picasso?
<i>– He's going east toward the Picasso!</i>

842
01:22:23,814 --> 01:22:26,567
We want you to give
all these groups a big round of applause.

843
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:30,904
They've been waiting a long time
to get in the parade.

844
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:34,032
They're cold, just like all the rest of you.

845
01:23:57,824 --> 01:24:02,663
Deputy Gerard, why do you feel
that Dr. Kimble came back to Chicago?

846
01:24:03,163 --> 01:24:04,456
I have no idea.

847
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:07,376
We understand your deputies
were at the hospital today.

848
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,336
Was Dr. Kimble there?

849
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:11,505
I have no comment on that.

850
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:13,799
Let me get the chronology straight.

851
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:16,802
The subject was tried, convicted,
incarcerated...

852
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:21,640
...escaped, presumed dead,
and is now at large in Chicago. Correct?

853
01:24:21,932 --> 01:24:24,059
Except for being presumed dead.

854
01:24:24,268 --> 01:24:27,229
Do you believe that Kimble's
armed and dangerous?

855
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:29,398
I believe he's dangerous, yes.

856
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:33,610
He's taking chances, conning back.
Do you feel that perhaps he's innocent?

857
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:38,282
No, he's not innocent. He was convicted
in a court of law. He's guilty.

858
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:40,450
How will you try to catch him?

859
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:42,619
We have no further comments for now.

860
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:29,846
Alec. Alec.

861
01:28:30,096 --> 01:28:31,431
Richard Kimble.

862
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:34,810
Hi, how are you?
– Good, Dr. Kimble.

863
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:37,979
Lentz.

864
01:28:38,188 --> 01:28:41,733
<i>We've been trading phone calls
the last few days.</i>

865
01:29:02,212 --> 01:29:04,005
A cruise sponsored
by Devlin MacGregor...

866
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:05,590
– ...could be fun.
– Enjoy.

867
01:29:05,799 --> 01:29:07,259
Hi.

868
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:15,475
<i>- Cancun, Richard.</i>
<i>- Sport fishing.</i>

869
01:29:15,684 --> 01:29:16,768
Pina coladas.

870
01:29:16,977 --> 01:29:19,104
What does the hospital have to buy?
What's the catch?

871
01:29:19,312 --> 01:29:20,397
Sailfish.

872
01:29:20,981 --> 01:29:23,149
No strings attached.

873
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:26,236
<i>What do you say? What do you say?</i>

874
01:29:29,072 --> 01:29:31,533
This guy is bleeding
from every needle puncture.

875
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:35,245
Lentz sent this guy in?
Is he on that wonder drug?

876
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:38,623
Yes, he's on the RDU-90 protocol,
Provasic.

877
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:40,333
Drug of the future.

878
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:43,420
Clean out those arteries
and put us out of business.

879
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:52,512
"Parade Master of Ceremonies
Ed O'Flaherty said...

880
01:29:52,721 --> 01:29:56,308
...he didn't recall a livelier parade
during the last 20 years.

881
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:57,934
That Kimble...

882
01:29:58,143 --> 01:30:01,479
– ...is some kind of lad to be running out--"
– "Lad"?

883
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:03,064
He says "lad."

884
01:30:03,273 --> 01:30:05,233
Maybe he's a leprechaun.

885
01:30:05,442 --> 01:30:07,694
– I'm quoting this guy.
– Sam.

886
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:10,322
A guy on line 3 claims he's Richard Kimble.

887
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:13,033
– Who?
– Another Kimble on line 3.

888
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,744
- – Let me see the phone.
- Tell him he looks good in a beard.

889
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:17,078
- – What line?
- Three.

890
01:30:17,287 --> 01:30:20,832
"I hope he was able to wear
a little green, sip some whiskey...."

891
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:22,709
This is Gerard.

892
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:26,504
Remember what I told you in the tunnel?

893
01:30:28,298 --> 01:30:32,135
It's him!
– I remember it was noisy.

894
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:34,763
I think you said something like...

895
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:36,640
...you didn't kill your wife.

896
01:30:36,973 --> 01:30:38,475
Remember what you told me?

897
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:41,645
I remember you pointed my gun at me.

898
01:30:45,315 --> 01:30:48,193
You said, "I don't care."

899
01:30:48,401 --> 01:30:49,778
He's on the south side.

900
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:55,408
That's right, I don't care.
I'm not trying to solve a puzzle.

901
01:30:55,784 --> 01:30:57,577
I am trying to solve a puzzle.

902
01:30:57,994 --> 01:30:59,245
Five seconds to location.

903
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:01,790
And I just found a big piece.

904
01:31:02,207 --> 01:31:03,875
Richard.

905
01:31:04,668 --> 01:31:06,419
Richard?

906
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:10,840
<i>Richard? Richard?</i>

907
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:12,425
<i>Hello, Richard?</i>

908
01:31:12,634 --> 01:31:14,010
He didn't hang up. Where is he at?

909
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:16,346
– Here it comes.
– Where is he at?

910
01:31:16,554 --> 01:31:17,722
256 South St. Lawrence.

911
01:31:17,931 --> 01:31:20,183
Get the C.P.D. over there.

912
01:31:20,392 --> 01:31:22,602
We got a car there now.

913
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:54,217
Get some shots of that.

914
01:31:57,470 --> 01:31:58,805
Fredrick Sykes...

915
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:04,144
...45, ex-cop, and quite a clotheshorse.

916
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:06,271
You want to look at this?

917
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:07,939
Yeah.

918
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:12,485
Kimble's prints.
They're all over, but mainly on the desk.

919
01:32:12,694 --> 01:32:15,572
He sure had interest in these photos.
Flipped through the whole package.

920
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,115
– Paused here.
– Negatives in there?

921
01:32:17,323 --> 01:32:18,616
– Right there.
– Let me have them.

922
01:32:18,825 --> 01:32:21,494
<i>Camera boy's on his way.</i>
– We got you.

923
01:32:38,511 --> 01:32:40,054
How you doing, Mr. Sykes?

924
01:32:40,263 --> 01:32:43,266
– Fine, if you tell me what's happening.
– We had a problem.

925
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,519
– My place or the place upstairs?
– Your place.

926
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:49,230
- – Well, now.
- Step right in, Mr. Sykes.

927
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:52,442
Everybody knows my name here.
Big happy family, huh?

928
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:56,321
What is this, a trench coat convention?
What's going on?

929
01:32:56,529 --> 01:32:59,115
Who are you guys? What's going on?

930
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:05,121
You had a break-in, Mr. Sykes.

931
01:33:05,622 --> 01:33:07,373
I sure hope you're a cop.

932
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:10,710
No, I'm Samuel Gerard,
United States Marshal's office.

933
01:33:11,795 --> 01:33:16,466
This morning a fugitive named Richard Kimble
made a phone call from here.

934
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:18,384
Why would he do that?

935
01:33:18,968 --> 01:33:21,137
I don't know any Richard Kimble.

936
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:29,062
Okay, I got it.

937
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:31,523
The doctor who killed his wife, right?

938
01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:36,152
Blamed somebody with a prosthetic.
Is he coming after me?

939
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:38,071
Does he have reason to do so?

940
01:33:38,488 --> 01:33:41,199
I have a prosthetic arm! I must've done it!

941
01:33:41,825 --> 01:33:44,911
Give me a break.
I went through all this a year ago.

942
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:47,789
I was questioned here about the whole thing.

943
01:33:47,997 --> 01:33:52,210
I told them I wasn't in Chicago that night.
I was away on business.

944
01:33:52,418 --> 01:33:54,170
Fifteen people verified it.

945
01:33:54,379 --> 01:33:55,839
What line of business are you in?

946
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:57,799
Security.

947
01:33:58,007 --> 01:34:00,510
– Who do you work for?
– A pharmaceutical company.

948
01:34:00,718 --> 01:34:02,303
– Which one?
– Devlin MacGregor.

949
01:34:02,512 --> 01:34:04,931
I handle security for the top executives.

950
01:34:06,933 --> 01:34:10,603
Any idea why Kimble would be interested
in these photographs?

951
01:34:12,021 --> 01:34:13,273
No.

952
01:34:13,857 --> 01:34:15,900
Where were they taken?

953
01:34:16,109 --> 01:34:17,569
Jeez, that's a big fish!

954
01:34:17,777 --> 01:34:19,320
Cancun, Mexico.

955
01:34:19,529 --> 01:34:22,156
It was a junket the company paid for,
for some doctors.

956
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:25,451
– Kimble go with you?
– You don't see him there, do you?

957
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:30,832
No. I told you I don't know him.

958
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,418
Mind if I check to see if anything's missing?

959
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:35,461
No, I don't mind.

960
01:34:41,467 --> 01:34:42,802
How'd you lose that arm?

961
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:45,054
In the line of duty.

962
01:34:55,231 --> 01:34:57,317
Cosmo, this guy's dirty.

963
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:59,485
Yes, he is.

964
01:34:59,736 --> 01:35:02,822
– You want our people on him?
– Yes. Build a camp here.

965
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:04,198
– Henry.
– I'll take care of it.

966
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:05,700
- – Noah.
- Yes, sir?

967
01:35:05,909 --> 01:35:09,996
See this picture? I want you to find out
who the guy is next to Sykes.

968
01:35:10,413 --> 01:35:14,042
Find out his name, age, weight,
social security number...

969
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:17,921
...his location, relatives, pets, everything.

970
01:35:37,774 --> 01:35:40,610
Sorry, doctor, they said it was an emergency.

971
01:35:43,112 --> 01:35:45,114
Thank you. Excuse me.

972
01:35:56,584 --> 01:35:59,003
- – Hello.
<i>- Mr. Bolton.</i>

973
01:35:59,212 --> 01:36:01,422
– Chuck.
<i>– Richard.</i>

974
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:02,966
Can you talk?

975
01:36:03,174 --> 01:36:06,970
Yes, I'm on a hotel phone.
How are you? What's going on?

976
01:36:07,804 --> 01:36:10,974
I found him.
I found the man who killed Helen.

977
01:36:11,683 --> 01:36:14,727
– What?
– It was me they were after.

978
01:36:14,936 --> 01:36:16,187
Who are they?

979
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:19,899
Devlin MacGregor and Lentz.

980
01:36:20,483 --> 01:36:23,444
Lentz was supervising the protocol
for RDU-90.

981
01:36:23,653 --> 01:36:26,823
He knew I found out
it was causing liver damage. It was Lentz.

982
01:36:28,825 --> 01:36:31,744
Richard, Lentz is dead.

983
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:34,288
What? How?

984
01:36:34,497 --> 01:36:37,250
<i>He died in a car accident last summer.</i>

985
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:42,046
<i>– Richard?</i>
– Yeah.

986
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:44,090
Can you prove this about the drug?

987
01:36:44,924 --> 01:36:46,259
I think so.

988
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:49,345
I need your help.

989
01:36:49,595 --> 01:36:53,099
Call Bones at the hospital.
Tell him to give me any help I need.

990
01:36:53,307 --> 01:36:54,350
Sure.

991
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:55,893
I'll call him now.

992
01:36:56,102 --> 01:36:57,353
Okay. Thanks.

993
01:37:03,901 --> 01:37:05,528
– Dr. Nichols.
– Hey!

994
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:07,155
– How are you doing?
– Good.

995
01:37:07,363 --> 01:37:08,906
Dr. Nichols!

996
01:37:09,115 --> 01:37:11,492
Can we ask you a few more questions?

997
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:12,910
Mr. Gerard.

998
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:17,498
You got a copy of that photograph?
U.S. Marshal Service.

999
01:37:17,707 --> 01:37:19,042
Excuse us.

1000
01:37:22,462 --> 01:37:23,963
This is Fredrick Sykes.

1001
01:37:24,172 --> 01:37:27,925
He's a security specialist
at Devlin MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.

1002
01:37:28,134 --> 01:37:30,428
Richard Kimble broke into his apartment.

1003
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:33,473
– Do you know this man?
– No, I don't.

1004
01:37:35,308 --> 01:37:38,519
You're getting pretty desperate, aren't you,
Mr. Gerard?

1005
01:37:38,728 --> 01:37:39,979
Oh, yes.

1006
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:42,815
I told you you wouldn't find Richard.

1007
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:44,317
Has he been to see you?

1008
01:37:44,984 --> 01:37:46,277
No.

1009
01:37:46,903 --> 01:37:49,989
We've been over this ground before,
haven't we?

1010
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:51,324
Yeah.

1011
01:37:52,325 --> 01:37:54,577
So if you'll excuse me.

1012
01:37:55,536 --> 01:37:58,581
– Sure. Thanks, doc.
– Thank you, doctor.

1013
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:00,833
Dr. Nichols.

1014
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:03,836
Sorry. One more question
about the photograph.

1015
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:07,048
See the guy standing on the right side
of the fish?

1016
01:38:07,256 --> 01:38:09,092
– Ever see him before?
– No.

1017
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:11,010
– This guy right here?
– Mm-hm.

1018
01:38:11,427 --> 01:38:14,055
I've never seen that person before.

1019
01:38:14,263 --> 01:38:15,932
– Okay.
– I'm sorry.

1020
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:17,350
Thank you.

1021
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:21,104
Thank you, doctor.
Enjoy the rest of the convention.

1022
01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:28,653
"Alternatives to Cardio-Non-lnvasive...

1023
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:30,947
...Arterial Plaque-Reducing Therapy.

1024
01:38:31,155 --> 01:38:33,407
Keynote speaker, Charles Nichols."

1025
01:38:33,616 --> 01:38:35,451
Bet they line up for this one.

1026
01:38:51,843 --> 01:38:54,262
If you were Richard Kimble...

1027
01:38:54,595 --> 01:38:58,224
...why would you hunt for a one-armed man
you say killed your wife...

1028
01:38:58,433 --> 01:39:01,936
...break into his house,
call us up and then split?

1029
01:39:02,437 --> 01:39:03,938
I should have been a doctor.

1030
01:39:04,605 --> 01:39:08,609
Look at this blowup.
This guy in the picture with Sykes. On his shirt.

1031
01:39:09,152 --> 01:39:11,362
Chicago Memorial. Kimble's hospital.
I want to go there.

1032
01:39:11,571 --> 01:39:12,822
Go.

1033
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:14,490
Wait.

1034
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:19,120
Devlin MacGregor...

1035
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:23,040
...did 7 and one half billion dollars
in net sales...

1036
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:25,793
...last year alone.

1037
01:39:27,545 --> 01:39:29,547
That company's a monster.

1038
01:39:38,055 --> 01:39:39,473
Talk to me.

1039
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:45,229
Absolutely.

1040
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:47,773
It's a liver sample...

1041
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:50,776
...from a patient on the RDU-90 drug study.

1042
01:39:50,985 --> 01:39:52,778
January 21st?

1043
01:39:52,987 --> 01:39:54,363
Ah!

1044
01:39:54,572 --> 01:39:56,407
The last one!

1045
01:39:56,991 --> 01:39:58,284
1-7-4-3-0?

1046
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:00,828
1-7-4-3-0. You got it.

1047
01:40:02,246 --> 01:40:05,166
Thanks.
I'll make sure all this gets back to you.

1048
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:11,756
– It's good to see you again.
– Good to see you.

1049
01:40:11,964 --> 01:40:15,468
Whatever happened to that thing
with your wife?

1050
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:19,680
It's not over yet.

1051
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:41,786
What's going on?

1052
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:43,621
How should I know?

1053
01:40:56,926 --> 01:41:00,763
I think his name is Alec Lentz.
A pathologist.

1054
01:41:01,222 --> 01:41:02,890
I remember because he died last summer.

1055
01:41:12,233 --> 01:41:14,235
Oh, my God. Richard!

1056
01:41:14,735 --> 01:41:16,737
What are you doing here?

1057
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:18,406
Hi, Kath.

1058
01:41:33,921 --> 01:41:35,256
Have a look.

1059
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:39,885
– What do you think?
– Cold normal.

1060
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:42,305
Clearly not the same tissue.

1061
01:41:42,513 --> 01:41:46,183
And not only did they all come
from healthy livers...

1062
01:41:46,684 --> 01:41:48,686
...they came from the same liver.

1063
01:41:50,855 --> 01:41:52,523
Kath, you beauty.

1064
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:00,197
Excuse me.

1065
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:02,241
Mr. Roosevelt?

1066
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:03,492
Yes.

1067
01:42:03,701 --> 01:42:06,787
We're deputies Biggs and Newman.
We're U.S. Marshals.

1068
01:42:07,371 --> 01:42:10,958
Need some information about a Dr. Lentz
who was on staff here.

1069
01:42:11,167 --> 01:42:15,796
Did he know or have any contact
with a Dr. Richard Kimble?

1070
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:17,965
I haven't seen Dr. Kimble.

1071
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:20,343
I didn't ask that.

1072
01:42:21,635 --> 01:42:23,137
I wouldn't know.

1073
01:42:23,471 --> 01:42:27,308
If you'll excuse me,
I have prior obligations to attend to.

1074
01:42:27,516 --> 01:42:30,102
- Mr. Roosevelt.
- Yes?

1075
01:42:30,311 --> 01:42:32,897
I think you're lying to us.

1076
01:42:33,481 --> 01:42:35,358
Lentz is the bad guy?

1077
01:42:36,609 --> 01:42:38,069
Yeah, why not?

1078
01:42:39,654 --> 01:42:43,240
He was one of the original
patent holders in RDU-90.

1079
01:42:44,575 --> 01:42:46,702
I was sending in my tissue samples...

1080
01:42:47,411 --> 01:42:51,123
...he was replacing them with healthy samples,
issuing path reports...

1081
01:42:51,332 --> 01:42:53,125
...shit-canning my stuff. Easy.

1082
01:42:53,334 --> 01:42:54,502
Wait a minute.

1083
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:57,338
Lentz died August 21st.

1084
01:42:57,672 --> 01:42:59,215
Yeah.

1085
01:42:59,423 --> 01:43:03,844
Half the samples he approved
were signed the day he died.

1086
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:06,722
You're kidding.

1087
01:43:08,349 --> 01:43:11,102
Someone else must have been
manipulating this.

1088
01:43:11,769 --> 01:43:13,229
Someone with access.

1089
01:43:24,949 --> 01:43:26,409
Thanks, Kath.

1090
01:43:26,617 --> 01:43:28,035
Where are you going?

1091
01:43:29,453 --> 01:43:30,871
To see a friend.

1092
01:43:36,377 --> 01:43:38,295
This is giving me a headache.

1093
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:42,425
That's surprising.
Where did Roosevelt say Kimble was going?

1094
01:43:42,633 --> 01:43:44,677
He says he doesn't know.

1095
01:43:45,219 --> 01:43:46,971
– Do you believe him?
<i>– Yes, I do.</i>

1096
01:43:47,221 --> 01:43:49,849
<i>– He says he picked up tissue samples...</i>
– What?

1097
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:51,434
<i>...for a drug study.</i>

1098
01:43:51,642 --> 01:43:53,144
Get this:

1099
01:43:53,394 --> 01:43:56,480
The release was approved
by Dr. Charles Nichols.

1100
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:59,859
<i>Nichols also knew Lentz.</i>

1101
01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:02,069
Whoa.
<i>– He was Lentz's boss.</i>

1102
01:44:02,278 --> 01:44:03,654
He was covering for Kimble.

1103
01:44:03,988 --> 01:44:05,781
Send the C.P.D. there right now.

1104
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:10,286
We're sending cops.
Make sure they turn that place inside out.

1105
01:44:10,494 --> 01:44:13,914
Don't let them give you shit
about your ponytail. Well done.

1106
01:44:14,123 --> 01:44:15,666
My pleasure.

1107
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:18,294
Henry.

1108
01:44:18,502 --> 01:44:20,379
Dr. Nichols lied to me.

1109
01:44:20,588 --> 01:44:22,590
– Go find him.
– I'm on it.

1110
01:44:30,431 --> 01:44:31,891
Okay, it's gone by now.

1111
01:44:32,099 --> 01:44:35,561
I looked every place you told me
and I didn't see him.

1112
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:36,896
I'm telling you.

1113
01:44:37,104 --> 01:44:40,107
If he was in the hospital,
I would have found him.

1114
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:42,193
What do you want me to do?

1115
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:45,112
Hold on. Wait a minute.

1116
01:44:45,362 --> 01:44:47,865
I marked him. I got him now.

1117
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:19,063
Dr. Alexander Lentz.

1118
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:22,608
"A noted pathologist
at Chicago Memorial Hospital...

1119
01:45:22,817 --> 01:45:26,278
...was walking to his daily tennis match
when an unidentified vehicle...

1120
01:45:26,487 --> 01:45:31,867
...slammed his body into the barriers
separating the Drive from Lake Michigan."

1121
01:45:32,368 --> 01:45:33,410
Yuck.

1122
01:45:33,619 --> 01:45:36,622
Sam, you won't believe this.

1123
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:40,209
Sykes' records for the past two years
show no calls to Kimble.

1124
01:45:40,626 --> 01:45:41,669
It was a thought.

1125
01:45:41,877 --> 01:45:45,548
But when I cross-checked Kimble's records,
one came up.

1126
01:45:45,756 --> 01:45:46,966
Kimble called Sykes--

1127
01:45:49,426 --> 01:45:50,678
Get Sykes in here now.

1128
01:45:50,886 --> 01:45:52,555
--on the night of the murder...

1129
01:45:52,763 --> 01:45:54,098
...7:30 p.m...

1130
01:45:54,306 --> 01:45:55,683
...from his car phone.

1131
01:45:55,891 --> 01:45:58,394
Do you have Kimble's arrest report?

1132
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,985
– 7:30 p.m.
– 19:30 hours.

1133
01:46:07,987 --> 01:46:10,322
They just went in. Sykes is gone.

1134
01:46:10,531 --> 01:46:11,699
He's nowhere to be found.

1135
01:46:11,907 --> 01:46:14,159
– What?
– He's gone.

1136
01:47:18,641 --> 01:47:21,060
Uh, listen, this is transit unit number 23.

1137
01:47:21,268 --> 01:47:26,523
Possible sighting of Richard Kimble
on northbound El coming into Van Buren.

1138
01:47:29,818 --> 01:47:31,737
Move to the door.

1139
01:47:39,703 --> 01:47:42,998
<i>Next stop, Balbo Station. Balbo.</i>

1140
01:47:43,248 --> 01:47:44,917
This is my stop.

1141
01:47:46,335 --> 01:47:48,003
My stop too.

1142
01:47:49,296 --> 01:47:50,964
Kimble.

1143
01:48:48,272 --> 01:48:49,732
You missed your stop.

1144
01:49:12,921 --> 01:49:16,508
A transit cop saw Kimble on the El,
heading toward Balbo.

1145
01:49:16,717 --> 01:49:19,053
The C.P.D. is on the way.

1146
01:49:54,046 --> 01:49:55,506
<i>Attention all units.</i>

1147
01:49:55,714 --> 01:49:58,759
<i>Transit police report officer down
at Balbo Station.</i>

1148
01:49:59,092 --> 01:50:01,428
<i>Kimble is suspect.</i>

1149
01:50:02,012 --> 01:50:03,430
What'd he do, shoot a cop?

1150
01:50:03,639 --> 01:50:06,016
Chicago P.D. will eat him alive.

1151
01:50:10,437 --> 01:50:13,357
It is a joy and a privilege...

1152
01:50:14,191 --> 01:50:17,194
...to introduce tonight's keynote speaker.

1153
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:29,414
For the past four years...

1154
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:32,918
...he has served
as the A. Jude Robinson Fellow...

1155
01:50:33,126 --> 01:50:36,296
...and administrative chief of Pathology...

1156
01:50:36,505 --> 01:50:38,882
...at Chicago Memorial Hospital.

1157
01:50:43,554 --> 01:50:45,889
Where are the emergency exits?

1158
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:50,978
<i>Suspect seen entering
Hilton Tower Mall, lower level.</i>

1159
01:50:51,854 --> 01:50:54,565
You don't think--
– Yeah, I know where he's going.

1160
01:50:56,483 --> 01:50:58,026
Biggs, Newman, where are you?

1161
01:50:59,987 --> 01:51:04,867
He was appointed to the Board of Directors
of Devlin MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.

1162
01:51:05,576 --> 01:51:07,661
<i>Will you please welcome...</i>

1163
01:51:08,078 --> 01:51:10,247
...Dr. Charles Nichols?

1164
01:51:16,795 --> 01:51:19,214
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen...

1165
01:51:19,423 --> 01:51:21,341
...friends and colleagues.

1166
01:51:21,925 --> 01:51:24,177
<i>It's great you're all here tonight.</i>

1167
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:40,485
C.P.D. reported an officer down
and a guy with two guns--

1168
01:51:40,694 --> 01:51:42,613
– Kimble do it?
– Conflicting reports.

1169
01:51:42,821 --> 01:51:44,656
He entered the hotel from the subway.

1170
01:51:44,865 --> 01:51:46,491
- – That's my man!
- Not anymore.

1171
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:48,785
He's going down.
You can help by staying out.

1172
01:51:48,994 --> 01:51:50,329
Arrest us!

1173
01:51:50,537 --> 01:51:52,873
Lock it up! Start at the lower level.

1174
01:51:55,542 --> 01:51:58,128
<i>All units report when
lower level is secure.</i>

1175
01:52:00,464 --> 01:52:03,217
<i>All units, secure all lower level exits.</i>

1176
01:52:04,051 --> 01:52:07,804
Noah, find the hotel security office.
Stay in touch with me by radio.

1177
01:52:10,974 --> 01:52:12,434
Now, a new drug...

1178
01:52:12,643 --> 01:52:16,647
...on the cusp of approval
by the Food and Drug Administration...

1179
01:52:16,897 --> 01:52:20,984
...is poised to change
these old methods forever.

1180
01:52:21,860 --> 01:52:24,905
– Deputy Newman, U.S. Marshal's Service.
– How you doing.

1181
01:52:25,322 --> 01:52:26,990
Good. Sam, I'm in.

1182
01:52:30,744 --> 01:52:34,414
--through the normal metabolic
pathways in the liver.

1183
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:37,668
The drug's name is...

1184
01:52:37,876 --> 01:52:39,294
...Provasic.

1185
01:52:40,837 --> 01:52:42,965
As I will show you tonight...

1186
01:52:43,173 --> 01:52:45,926
...Provasic is remarkably effective...

1187
01:52:46,134 --> 01:52:49,346
...and has no side effects whatsoever.

1188
01:52:49,596 --> 01:52:52,266
It is also noteworthy that this drug--

1189
01:52:57,521 --> 01:52:59,773
This drug was developed...

1190
01:52:59,982 --> 01:53:03,151
...in cooperation, not competition
with Chicago Memorial Hospital...

1191
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:05,028
...in what we hope will be...

1192
01:53:05,237 --> 01:53:08,115
...the model for a continued dishonest....

1193
01:53:08,865 --> 01:53:10,367
Excuse me, honest...

1194
01:53:14,162 --> 01:53:15,330
...open joint ventures...

1195
01:53:15,539 --> 01:53:18,041
...between academic medicine...

1196
01:53:18,250 --> 01:53:20,294
...and the pharmaceutical....

1197
01:53:20,544 --> 01:53:22,004
Richard.

1198
01:53:23,296 --> 01:53:26,842
I'm sorry, I'm in the middle of this speech.

1199
01:53:27,217 --> 01:53:28,969
You almost got away with it.

1200
01:53:31,555 --> 01:53:33,140
I know all about it.

1201
01:53:34,975 --> 01:53:36,268
I can prove it.

1202
01:53:37,811 --> 01:53:41,690
Ladies and gentlemen,
my friend Richard Kimble doesn't feel well...

1203
01:53:41,898 --> 01:53:43,400
...obviously...

1204
01:53:43,817 --> 01:53:47,112
...so just go on with your
dessert and coffee....

1205
01:53:47,404 --> 01:53:50,866
Richard, do you mind stepping aside
and let's talk.

1206
01:53:51,074 --> 01:53:52,451
Okay.

1207
01:53:52,659 --> 01:53:55,746
So I'll be back in just a second.

1208
01:53:59,583 --> 01:54:02,002
You changed the samples, didn't you?

1209
01:54:03,754 --> 01:54:06,048
You switched the samples...

1210
01:54:06,256 --> 01:54:09,051
– ...after Lentz died.
– Richard, let--

1211
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:12,179
Let's stay calm, people.

1212
01:54:13,597 --> 01:54:17,017
After Lentz died,
you were the only one who had access.

1213
01:54:18,185 --> 01:54:20,270
You switched the samples...

1214
01:54:20,771 --> 01:54:22,981
...and the pathology reports.

1215
01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:24,566
Did you kill Lentz too?

1216
01:54:24,775 --> 01:54:26,109
Call Security.

1217
01:54:26,318 --> 01:54:27,360
Did you?

1218
01:54:28,153 --> 01:54:30,781
He falsified his research...

1219
01:54:32,115 --> 01:54:34,493
...so RDU-90 could be...

1220
01:54:34,701 --> 01:54:36,036
...approved and...

1221
01:54:36,286 --> 01:54:39,373
...Devlin MacGregor could give you Provasic.

1222
01:54:41,625 --> 01:54:43,043
It's all over, folks.

1223
01:54:43,251 --> 01:54:45,128
Just stay calm.

1224
01:55:01,603 --> 01:55:04,731
You never give up, do you?
You never give up!

1225
01:55:27,587 --> 01:55:28,630
Why Helen?

1226
01:55:31,633 --> 01:55:32,884
Glad you're here.

1227
01:55:33,093 --> 01:55:34,136
Which way'd they go?

1228
01:55:34,344 --> 01:55:36,263
– Toward the Presidential Suite.
– Where's that?

1229
01:55:36,471 --> 01:55:38,807
– Southeast corner.
– How many exits are there from this room?

1230
01:55:39,015 --> 01:55:42,853
We got a total of four:
two on the east, two on the west.

1231
01:55:44,187 --> 01:55:45,313
Kimble's on the roof!

1232
01:55:46,022 --> 01:55:47,607
Cosmo, that way.

1233
01:56:00,370 --> 01:56:02,581
Stop! Stay where you are!

1234
01:56:02,789 --> 01:56:04,583
This is the Chicago police!

1235
01:56:05,292 --> 01:56:07,252
Put your hands in the air!

1236
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:09,713
The building is totally secure.

1237
01:56:10,046 --> 01:56:12,465
I repeat, do not move!

1238
01:56:13,383 --> 01:56:15,051
Put your hands in the air!

1239
01:56:15,677 --> 01:56:18,305
I repeat, stay where you are!

1240
01:56:41,912 --> 01:56:43,079
Talk to me.

1241
01:56:43,288 --> 01:56:45,957
They're headed to the north end of the roof.

1242
01:56:46,166 --> 01:56:47,334
Newman!

1243
01:56:48,335 --> 01:56:50,378
Get that helicopter out of here!

1244
01:56:54,216 --> 01:56:56,218
As soon as you get a clean shot...

1245
01:56:56,426 --> 01:56:58,094
...take him out.

1246
01:57:16,279 --> 01:57:18,240
Get rid of the helicopter!

1247
01:57:18,448 --> 01:57:20,450
<i>Why?</i>
– Because I don't want to get shot!

1248
01:57:20,951 --> 01:57:24,913
C.P.D., there's a U.S. Marshal on the roof.
Hold your fire!

1249
01:57:25,205 --> 01:57:27,541
<i>Call off the helicopter!</i>

1250
01:57:38,134 --> 01:57:39,844
Ah!

1251
01:58:15,088 --> 01:58:16,423
Don't shoot.

1252
01:58:19,759 --> 01:58:21,553
This guy ever quit?

1253
01:58:21,761 --> 01:58:23,722
Find out where that elevator stops.

1254
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:25,056
Newman. Newman!

1255
01:58:25,265 --> 01:58:27,642
Northwest elevator! Where does it stop?

1256
01:58:27,851 --> 01:58:30,103
Where did they go? Where did they go?

1257
01:59:00,633 --> 01:59:02,427
– Stopped on 5th floor.
– They're on the 5th.

1258
01:59:02,635 --> 01:59:04,387
- – What's on the 5th floor?
- The laundry.

1259
01:59:04,596 --> 01:59:05,805
It's the laundry.

1260
01:59:06,639 --> 01:59:08,433
<i>They stopped at the laundry.</i>

1261
01:59:52,602 --> 01:59:55,605
We're on the 5th floor. What's your 20?

1262
01:59:56,690 --> 01:59:58,024
Right behind you.

1263
01:59:58,274 --> 02:00:00,026
What's going on here?

1264
02:00:00,527 --> 02:00:03,655
We must keep the C.P.D. out.
They're too hot for me.

1265
02:00:03,863 --> 02:00:05,907
Get rid of all these people.

1266
02:00:06,116 --> 02:00:07,409
Okay, people, stay calm.

1267
02:00:07,617 --> 02:00:09,285
Cosmo, come with me.

1268
02:01:30,617 --> 02:01:33,286
Dr. Richard Kimble!

1269
02:01:33,953 --> 02:01:35,955
There's no way out of here!

1270
02:01:37,540 --> 02:01:40,210
The entire building is locked down!

1271
02:01:42,879 --> 02:01:44,923
Give it up, you don't have any time!

1272
02:01:45,131 --> 02:01:47,884
Chicago Police thinks you're a cop killer!

1273
02:01:49,135 --> 02:01:51,721
They will shoot you on sight!

1274
02:01:55,391 --> 02:01:57,477
I know you're innocent!

1275
02:01:58,895 --> 02:02:01,356
I know about Fredrick Sykes!

1276
02:02:03,983 --> 02:02:06,820
I know about Dr. Charles Nichols!

1277
02:02:08,738 --> 02:02:12,033
He borrowed your car
the night of your wife's murder!

1278
02:02:12,242 --> 02:02:13,868
He had the keys!

1279
02:02:14,077 --> 02:02:16,079
No forced entry.

1280
02:02:17,413 --> 02:02:20,250
He telephoned Sykes from your car,
Richard!

1281
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,592
Give it up!

1282
02:02:31,928 --> 02:02:34,931
I'm either lying or I'm gonna shoot you!

1283
02:02:36,099 --> 02:02:37,600
What do you think?

1284
02:02:56,953 --> 02:03:00,331
Give it up! It's time to stop running!

1285
02:03:40,997 --> 02:03:42,749
They killed my wife.

1286
02:03:43,583 --> 02:03:44,918
I know it.

1287
02:03:46,586 --> 02:03:47,837
I know it.

1288
02:03:49,839 --> 02:03:51,174
But it's over now.

1289
02:03:53,343 --> 02:03:56,054
Whew. You know, I'm glad.

1290
02:03:56,262 --> 02:03:57,931
I need the rest.

1291
02:04:12,612 --> 02:04:14,489
Who killed Kimble's wife?

1292
02:04:14,697 --> 02:04:16,574
Kimble was convicted of it.

1293
02:04:16,783 --> 02:04:19,494
You've got a one-armed man in custody.

1294
02:04:19,702 --> 02:04:21,663
- – Is that the guy?
- I have no idea.

1295
02:04:21,871 --> 02:04:23,498
How many one-armed men are there?

1296
02:04:23,706 --> 02:04:25,375
There're a lot of them.

1297
02:04:25,583 --> 02:04:27,543
Could you have made a mistake?

1298
02:04:30,630 --> 02:04:32,256
The one-armed man is also there.

1299
02:04:32,465 --> 02:04:34,467
I've never seen so much
since I've been around here.

1300
02:04:35,301 --> 02:04:37,553
You got a deadline, play the weather again.

1301
02:04:38,221 --> 02:04:40,473
Tell Samuel Gerard I'm going home now.

1302
02:04:40,682 --> 02:04:42,642
I'm taking my vacation.

1303
02:04:45,895 --> 02:04:48,231
Clear this area. Everybody clear.

1304
02:05:05,915 --> 02:05:07,166
Watch your head.

1305
02:05:18,428 --> 02:05:20,263
Where is that thing?

1306
02:05:20,930 --> 02:05:22,849
Let me see those hands, doctor.

1307
02:05:41,284 --> 02:05:42,785
I thought you didn't care.

1308
02:05:42,994 --> 02:05:44,287
I don't.

1309
02:05:47,290 --> 02:05:49,125
Don't tell anybody, okay?

1310
02:10:11,762 --> 02:10:13,764
[English – US]

02:10:14,305 --> 02:10:20,419
