2
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,795
Come on.
- I am coming.

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,116
There you can see it clearly.

4
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,592
How far is it?
- Up to the top.

5
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,631
I'm tired.

6
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,516
We are almost there.
Wait till you see the view.

7
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,236
Are you up?
- Yes.

8
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,156
You're right.
It's beautiful.

9
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,920
We should bring a blanket.

10
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,953
Brett, I said that we have a blanket
should have brought.

11
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,029
Brett?

12
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,110
Brett?

13
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,432
Brett, for God's sake!

14
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,913
Luke.
- How are you, Simon?

15
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,910
I'm not surprised to see you here.

16
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,951
Dito.

17
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,229
Who found it?
- Two festival goers.

18
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,318
They fell into a crack in the ground.

19
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,193
The police found them only after a week.

20
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,994
What happened?
- The boy was killed instantly.

21
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,193
The girl has been there for five days.

22
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,755
She died when they found her.

23
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,951
My God.

24
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,471
Michael.

25
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,198
Michael, keep up with it.

26
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,952
My God...

27
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,910
Michael, sit.
Do not move.

28
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,555
My God.

29
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,509
Do not move.

30
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,311
You had an accident.

31
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,796
I will notify an ambulance.
Do not move.

32
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,996
How is she?
- There are still testing.

33
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,078
But you have not so severe her
wonder if you thought.

34
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,432
That is impossible.
I know how hard I hit her.

35
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,430
She just has a cut on her head
and some scratches. No serious injuries.

36
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,235
But she is unconscious.
- No, she sleeps.

37
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,559
All results are fine.
She's a little disoriented.

38
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,469
Her short-term memory may be confused,
but there is no reason to keep her here.

39
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,399
You let her go?
- I'll see her in my practice.

40
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,310
I can not just leave.
Who will look after her?

41
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,399
I'm not leaving until I know her name.
- Cassie Grant.

42
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,515
Michael ...

43
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,072
The figure of Christ stands with his back to the church.

44
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,273
That's true.
That seems completely opposite.

45
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,116
This is a significant discovery, Luke.

46
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,993
I know.

47
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,230
I'm surprised you visited me.

48
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,718
Simon San Severa is a long time ago.
- Two years.

49
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,071
You were not my first choice.

50
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,429
The building itself is made of stone and clay.

51
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,474
This church was built in
the first century.

52
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,795
And the altar?

53
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,879
The altar from the same period.

54
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,833
It is unusual for a Crucifixion
seen from behind the cross.

55
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,828
Now it's destroyed.
- How fast?

56
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,191
I should be as fast as possible in all
card can bring.

57
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,712
When can you start?
- From the moment that I have a team.

58
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,470
Professor Kirkman, I prefer that you
only works at this time.

59
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,513
We believe that it is better
that as few people as possible outside the church ...

60
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,396
be aware of the works.

61
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,592
As long as it falls under our responsibility ...

62
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,793
we want to make our own analyzes.

63
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,355
And not press.
- We will cooperate in every way.

64
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,518
We will do everything necessary is provided.

65
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,831
Are you sure about this?
- It's the least I can do.

66
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,999
We still have too much space.
You can as long as necessary to.

67
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,076
You do not remember why you
went to Ashby Wake?

68
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,590
No. I need to know people here.

69
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,990
Sorry. It's all
still unclear.

70
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,239
Doktor Byworth said you confused yet
could have been in the beginning.

71
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,513
Ashby is a small village.
Someone will recognize you.

72
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,678
Michael is quiet.
- Yes.

73
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,235
How do you know his name?

74
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,590
You've probably already mentioned.
- Of course.

75
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,232
We are here.

76
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,630
This is Emma.

77
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,076
Hi Emma. I'm Cassie.

78
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,632
This is a great house.

79
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,072
We did it a year ago
bought, just after our marriage.

80
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,956
I am their stepmother.
But I must still work.

81
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,191
You have lots of beautiful objects.

82
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,039
That's my husband, Simon.
He is the expert in that area.

83
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,959
Your calm down.

84
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,037
I put some tea.
- I will help you.

85
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,678
What about that girl?
- Cassie?

86
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,558
I could do nothing else.

87
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,752
Imagine that I had slain her.

88
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,394
That would have been awful.

89
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,429
I was paralyzed.
I thought she was dead.

90
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,353
I have no idea what I
would have done.

91
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,793
Fortunately, we can help her.

92
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,798
She is almost all her belongings.

93
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,957
We can at least give her a bed.

94
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,710
Hey. How do you feel today?
- Much better, thanks.

95
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,152
I hope you do not mind.
I made breakfast for the children.

96
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,594
I showed her everything.
- You do not have to do this.

97
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,916
I do not mind.

98
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,955
Mrs. Groves there?

99
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,195
I've got a meeting in Oxford.
- I can take the kids to school.

100
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,313
It does not though.
- I want to do it with pleasure.

101
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,157
You do not know where the school is.
- Emma can show me.

102
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,955
Michael, how do you like your eggs?
Beaten or not?

103
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,071
He's a silent one.

104
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,353
If they do something weird here? She
mix with jam or something.

105
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,312
Thank you.

106
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,870
Hi.
- Sorry.

107
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,397
Most of the damage was caused by ...

108
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,390
salt which is in the building itself.

109
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,950
Especially the right are images
affected by it.

110
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,514
There are a lot of bumps and dirt
in most others ...

111
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,630
but it is remarkable, is not it?

112
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,436
Joseph of Arimathea.
He was at the crucifixion ...

113
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,359
and later went to England.

114
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,036
With the spear that wounded Jesus.

115
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,674
And?

116
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,269
He built a church in Glastonbury.

117
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,233
A Romanesque church of the first century.

118
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,034
Probably this.

119
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,589
That is possible.
- It is probable.

120
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,992
You know what we're watching
if we look at the altar?

121
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,595
A relic of the Crucifixion
of a person who was present.

122
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,957
Cassie, I made this for you.

123
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,510
I saw two people following me
known for coming.

124
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,428
I think they have recognized me, but
I have no idea who they were.

125
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,154
That happens to me all the time.

126
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,874
Headache?
- No.

127
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,475
Something else?

128
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,720
When I saw people,
it felt weird.

129
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,554
I do not think you worry
must make.

130
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,197
You've had a stroke. It takes
while before everything is back in order.

131
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,516
Ok?

132
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,558
Yes. Thanks.

133
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,635
Where did you find that?
- Is this yours? Did you write this?

134
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,833
- Yes.
- "A study of the faith."

135
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,670
It's about my work.
- I thought you restored art?

136
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,192
I will. I find out where the
comes from and whether it is authentic.

137
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,436
And that causes a lot of noise.

138
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,757
And it keeps me busy.
- For a long time.

139
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,954
It's nice to have you here.
- It's fine here.

140
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,549
The kids are very sweet.

141
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,117
Have you previously been babysitting?
- Not that I know.

142
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,831
Do you remember anything from your family?

143
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,792
No not yet.

144
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,118
There I also take a glass.
- Excuse me.

145
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,230
How long have you lived here?
- A year.

146
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,638
Emma was born in Ashby Wake.
She was nine when we came here.

147
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,037
We thought it a good place
was to make a new start.

148
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,473
The children have had a difficult time.
- Michael was four when his mother died.

149
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,197
Sorry.
- She had a long illness.

150
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,155
It was bad for Michael.
He took it hard on himself.

151
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,158
It was hard to see him suffer.

152
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,959
Idiot.

153
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,075
Everything alright?

154
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,672
I know you. Not true?

155
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,112
You do not recognize me?
- Yes, it does.

156
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,909
At the school.
- Exactly.

157
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,433
From where in the US you just come?
- Midwest.

158
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,710
I stay here with family.

159
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,840
I got hit by a car
a few days ago.

160
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,356
You hit?
- Yes.

161
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,156
Apparently I'm fine.
I just have a concussion.

162
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,275
Ocharme. That should be a huge
shock have been for you.

163
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,914
You stay in Ashby Wake?
- On the outside of the city.

164
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,396
Big house? With ma? Svelden?
- Yes that is it.

165
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,395
Do you live around here?
- I have not decided.

166
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,351
I like this region.
I'm looking for something to Stukeley Hill.

167
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:20,114
The report shows an unusually low pH value
and high salt concentrations in the ground.

168
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,110
This could damage the walls.
- I know that. I wrote that report.

169
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,474
What is interesting is that the land in 1200
years after the construction of the church has been.

170
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,557
That's not in your report.

171
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,675
This church was buried deliberately
around the time of the plague.

172
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,673
Luke, we've known each other long.
Why do you want to keep this secret?

173
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,155
There are things we still
do not understand.

174
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,675
If the church deliberately buried,
then there must have been a reason.

175
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,989
No!

176
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,078
Michael?

177
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,591
Michael?

178
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,754
Was that you?

179
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,951
Are you weeping?

180
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,912
Can not sleep?

181
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,158
Tie a good dog.

182
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,874
Just like the ones outside of barks.

183
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,079
You heard it, right?

184
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,791
And the kids?

185
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,795
Have you heard them?

186
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,033
It's all right.

187
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,992
There is nothing to be afraid of.

188
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,753
Ms. Groves?

189
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,715
Know someone who kind of a
pitbull dog is?

190
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,390
What pitbull?
- I do not know.

191
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,197
A caramel brown.
One with a very large head.

192
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:12,793
I've seen him here on the domain.
- A dog, I have not seen in a long time.

193
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,072
Where are the children?
I am almost finished.

194
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,233
How was the mother of Michael and Emma?
- Caroline? She was a treasure.

195
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,310
A good mother.

196
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,476
It's not about me ...

197
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,912
but it soon marry again has
the children no favors.

198
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,999
That should have brought them upset.
- Not as hard as when they moved here.

199
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,716
They should not buy this.
Would you call them in?

200
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,193
Michael? Emma?

201
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,709
You would not think straight.

202
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,312
Michael?

203
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,751
Everything is fine.

204
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,756
A journalist tries to reach the bishop.
Nobody should talk to the press.

205
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,235
No. Do you think I was?

206
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,875
No of course not.
- Yes.

207
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,150
Did you do it?

208
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,558
You still think you
was right, right?

209
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,756
About San Severa.

210
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,151
I just told the truth.

211
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,830
Like you saw. You undermined
people's faith ...

212
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,953
who were told that a piece of wood ...
- A holy relic.

213
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,357
A 19th century piece of driftwood
was a piece of the Holy Cross.

214
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,518
And they believed it was sacred.

215
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,313
I'm just ge Interested in fact.
- I know that.

216
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,356
I know that.

217
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,516
What we have here is authentic.
This may come in the newspapers.

218
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,508
This is the oldest crucifixion
we have thus far.

219
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,950
That's not what it is.

220
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,431
Aristobulus, a British bishop,
wrote a series of letters.

221
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,837
He was in Glastonbury,
in the first century, is not it?

222
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,077
Aristobulus mentions a church
founded by Joseph of Arimathea ...

223
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:33,400
and in the same letter, there is a footnote ...

224
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,513
where many people disagree about.

225
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,280
"They just came to watch ...

226
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,713
from the east and the west,
from the cities and the countryside.

227
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,276
They were not worshiping the Lord ...

228
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,789
but from desire. "

229
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,473
Your Latin is better than mine.

230
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,039
"They just came to watch.

231
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,557
Not out of adoration, but of desire. "

232
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,596
I think the bas-relief? F
it has to face.

233
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,478
In the course of time are
there have always been people ...

234
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,274
which just go to the show
came to watch.

235
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,871
People troepten together at the guillotines
during the French Revolution.

236
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,868
Masses that show up at the hanging
of the prisoners of Newgate.

237
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,595
People camping at a prison
before they turn on the switch.

238
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,952
But it remains a crucifixion.
A little unorthodox, but ...

239
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,355
It is not just a crucifixion.

240
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,552
It's not about Christ, Simon.

241
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,673
It's about the people who came to watch.

242
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,594
Alstubieft.
- Thank you.

243
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,033
Good morning.

244
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,711
Michael?

245
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,195
Sweetheart?

246
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,628
It's all right. He
you can not do anything.

247
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,150
Come on.

248
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,555
Come on, let's move on.

249
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,549
That looks like fun.

250
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,556
Michael!

251
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,639
I will see that they can do nothing.
I promise.

252
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,799
I am fine.
- I will let anything happen to you.

253
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,719
I promise.
- I am fine.

254
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:31,038
I'm sorry, Dan. I know no one
else I can address.

255
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,471
Cassie, what is it?

256
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,116
In recent days I have
of those ...

257
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:44,877
I do not know how to call them.
Images. Hallucinations.

258
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,714
I see horrible things.

259
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,634
And then I'm not sure
or I they really have seen.

260
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,114
You have been hit by a car.

261
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,553
But it's so real.
I am afraid that his characters.

262
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,911
For Signs? What?

263
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,111
I do not know.

264
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,108
You know what they mean?
- I have no idea.

265
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,871
How do I know if they are going to come true
if I'm not sure what they mean?

266
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,675
I will help you.

267
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,469
I feel so lonely.

268
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,992
You're not alone, Cassie.
You are not alone.

269
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,715
The dog barked like crazy to us
from the trunk of the car.

270
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:55,471
That guy just stared at Michael.
It was horrible.

271
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,070
There's only one ?? garage.
We'll stop there.

272
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,878
That is it.
That is certainly the car.

273
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,429
What are you doing?

274
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,751
Can I help you?

275
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,749
Can you tell me
Who is this car?

276
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,270
Why do you want to know that?
- I would not want to buy m.

277
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,678
He is not for sale.
He ?? one of my mechanics.

278
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,836
Is he here?
- No.

279
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,831
We get his number?
- No.

280
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,555
He has no phone.
- His address then.

281
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,553
Tine Cottage. Longridge Road.

282
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,796
His name is Argyle.

283
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,595
Jesus.

284
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,394
So that's that dog?

285
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,875
Yes, that's him.

286
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,749
In England, calls this burglary.

287
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,028
I'm nothing to break.

288
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,789
My God, look at this mess.

289
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,150
This is sad.

290
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,030
LOCAL ANGLER WINS
NATIONAL COMPETITION

291
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,517
My God, I know these people.

292
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,756
Then, I know these people.

293
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,269
That's my doctor from the hospital.

294
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,156
Come on, let's go.

295
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,237
That is Limecourt.

296
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,593
LIME INVESTIGATION INTO COURT
WILL BE OPENED

297
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:30,108
In the 60s it was a Limecourt
Children stay. A church residence.

298
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,512
They have been indicted for
child abuse.

299
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:40,316
What's new about that?
Come now, Cassie. We really have to go.

300
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,832
My God, they were all
involved with the case.

301
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,235
All these people.

302
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,715
Child abuse

303
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,672
Everyone must know.
The whole town must know.

304
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,314
He's on Lime Court.

305
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,471
He must have lived there.

306
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,391
My God. Then, that's Michael.

307
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,397
He has a picture of Michael.

308
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,192
Why does he have it?

309
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,312
I do not know.
Let's get out of here.

310
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,591
Wait.

311
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,950
My God, Dan.

312
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,038
You've seen it there.
This guy is obviously crazy.

313
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,915
I saw a pathetic life.
- We go to the police.

314
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,873
To tell what? That he
Photos of Michael?

315
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,117
Yes! And what about all those other pictures?

316
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,394
He sees himself in Michael as a child.
He wants to be clear from there.

317
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,388
?? In one of my ...
- Visions?

318
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:21,628
Yes, see in one of my visions ??
I Michael with a maimed face.

319
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,479
You can not go to the police
go and tell.

320
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,796
We have to do something.

321
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,590
Jesus.

322
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,755
Why do we seek not before
we proceed to drastic means?

323
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,230
... And all that happiness so early
piece is beaten.

324
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,352
Jackie went with him still on
his last political trip.

325
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,189
In Dallas he stayed with governor
Connally ...

326
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,238
and Vice President Lyndon Johnson,
who is also from Texas.

327
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,557
In which state are
Democrats unpopular.

328
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,438
But the charm of the Kennedys
turns out to be positive.

329
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,035
It was closed after all the noise.
It was scrapped.

330
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,959
And then bought Mrs. Kirkman
it and put it in order.

331
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,311
Did you come here earlier?
Did you know the priest who was in charge?

332
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,433
That does not matter.
It's all over now.

333
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,029
Nobody wants it back rake.

334
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,959
It seems to me that someone must have known
what was going on.

335
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:49,551
Cassie, nothing has been proven.
There were some rumors.

336
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,914
And it was bad. Terrible.
But it's over.

337
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,149
... But the safety standards are
changed compared to the early years.

338
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,670
The controversy surrounding the
Measures taken ...

339
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,036
... who were insolent and
often posed for the camera.

340
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,789
How many people have seen this suffering
have is unknown.

341
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,509
He's dangerous.
I think he wants revenge.

342
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,871
On whom he wants revenge?
- I do not know.

343
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,150
The people who hurt him.

344
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,557
Possibly the whole city.
- The whole town?

345
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,072
He is obsessed with a child
I pass on. Michael.

346
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,959
And why he wants to hurt this child?
- I do not know.

347
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,914
Because of his youth.
The way he was abused.

348
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,636
Do you have a name for this person?
- Frederick Michael Argyle.

349
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,272
Fred?

350
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:23,353
You do not have to worry about Fred.
Everybody in Ashby Wake knows Fred.

351
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:28,111
You'll find this funny?
What's going on here?

352
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:32,074
I fear that without proof
can not do much.

353
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,915
Stunning. Thank you.

354
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,790
And from the 19th century this male
figure on the right.

355
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,673
A close up of his face.
The figure of the bas-relief? F.

356
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,517
Here we look at the face of
the older woman in the background.

357
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,392
This is the close up of her face.

358
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,110
And again the same face on the bas-relief? F.

359
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,556
We must bury it.

360
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,518
Is not that too drastic?

361
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:25,719
I think we are all in agreement
are. As from the time of the discovery ...

362
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,356
and in memory of two young people.

363
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,029
However, this discovery is not
surprise for the scientists among us.

364
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:40,439
You're not the first to adopt
that these figures over and over again ...

365
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,518
appear in places with human suffering.

366
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,269
It has been documented
by certain Catholics.

367
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:53,237
And we must not forget that the church
already once been buried.

368
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,991
Bishop, forgive me, but the church
break off, even stone by stone,

369
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,714
will these tragedies
not prevent.

370
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,797
That is quite true.

371
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,231
Nothing on earth can.
But we can make sure that ...

372
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:12,117
which is not a place
of superstition and fear.

373
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:19,192
If people have to deal with it
calamity that could possibly happen ...

374
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,918
they go that which is good
lose sight of .

375
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,238
Can you handle this
Professor Kirkman?

376
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,477
Yes, I will be there tomorrow
right to drive.

377
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,279
Frederick Michael Argyle.
- Fred?

378
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,431
Everybody in Ashby Wake knows Fred.

379
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,279
He has a picture of Michael.

380
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,473
Why would he do this child pain?
- He wants to get rid of this child.

381
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,910
You do not have to worry about Fred.

382
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,675
Do not!

383
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,189
Please!

384
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,995
I will teach you, Argyle.
You were again walking around.

385
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,111
But always making noise, Argyle.
- No, please!

386
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:26,638
Furthermore you. You will remain in that room.

387
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,476
No!

388
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,671
Michael?

389
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,395
Take a deep breath.

390
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,270
It's all right.
- I heard voices.

391
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,119
I heard them dear.

392
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,836
What is going on? Michael?

393
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:10,511
He had a nightmare.
- It's all right. It's just a storm.

394
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,673
I'll take him.
- It's okay Michael.

395
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,155
Go with Marion.

396
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,514
Michael open this done?

397
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,392
Yes, he ...

398
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,037
Simon, where are these photos?

399
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,952
That's my job.

400
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,391
You have to tell me.
From where are these photos?

401
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,317
They are of an altar,
a bas-relief? f I'm working on.

402
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,113
But I've seen these people.

403
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,153
Here in Ashby Wake.

404
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,670
No, they are a work of art.
A very old art.

405
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:09,908
I've seen these people in your city.
- What are you saying?

406
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,315
It here.

407
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,749
And this one.

408
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,030
That's enough.

409
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,637
Please go to bed, Cassie.

410
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,672
My God...

411
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:30,115
Ladies and gentlemen.
Here is the mayor.

412
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,039
I will just say that I
am very excited to be here ...

413
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:38,360
and I with great joy
this carnival to declare open.

414
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,193
Wait for me.
- Walk.

415
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,196
To the fastest.

416
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,557
Yes, certainly.

417
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,118
Thanks. Day.

418
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,271
Luke Fraser died
in a car accident.

419
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,355
He was on his way to me.

420
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,798
The car did a somersault
and he died instantly.

421
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,400
I have to go.

422
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,909
The bishop asked to see me.

423
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,593
You wait here?
- Of course.

424
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,152
I'm thankful for you
conscientiousness, professor Kirkman.

425
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:07,478
It's a huge blow.
Luke was a remarkable man.

426
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,750
Yes.

427
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,190
There are things you to
my opinion is yet to see.

428
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,751
Aristobulus called it "the meeting".

429
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:25,512
The people who do not attend the
crucifixion came to honor ...

430
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,075
but to watch.

431
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,868
"They came from the east and the west,
not worship, but out of desire. "

432
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,828
Indeed.

433
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,749
In the church's tradition one goes there
from the meeting is cursed.

434
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:52,554
Enchanted by the darkness,
so that their members were doomed ...

435
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:57,231
eternally to witness
human misery.

436
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,389
The first World War.

437
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,430
The explosion of the first atomic bomb.

438
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:14,275
The barbaric lynching
of a person.

439
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,033
I have compromised your faith?

440
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:30,034
No, I am not religious.
- You believe in science.

441
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,070
Do you have a phone?
- Yes.

442
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,273
I know who these people are.

443
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,230
They are now here.

444
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,836
Cassie, look at me.

445
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,156
See my legs.

446
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,471
Look at me.

447
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,550
Cassie, look.
- Come on, let's go.

448
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,031
They are here.

449
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:42,392
Ms. Groves?
- Do you want a balloon?

450
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,558
Do you want to fit as them?
- I do not know about.

451
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,591
This is very important.

452
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,117
Cassie, where are the kids?
- They're over there with Mrs Groves.

453
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,197
Simon said that we were in danger.

454
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,278
You have to believe me.
Bring the kids out of here.

455
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,793
Look who's here.
It is Actionman.

456
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,355
Nice to see you again come around, Freddie.

457
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,677
What you got there?
Weather on rabbit hunting?

458
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,511
Damn!

459
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,837
You two!

460
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,875
And where are you now?

461
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,320
No, I've never done.

462
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,636
Hello, stranger.

463
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,513
Cassie ...
- Stay away from me.

464
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,995
Who are you?
- What are you talking about?

465
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:59,278
I'm talking about a skulptuur
that was created 2,000 years ago.

466
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:03,075
I have tonight images
seen. I've seen you.

467
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,794
You stood by.

468
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,596
Yes.

469
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:17,635
What does it mean?
Who are you?

470
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:21,992
You should not have gone to the police.
I did try to warn you.

471
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,636
You could get out of it,
and I could not admit.

472
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:31,389
There was a cop here. Where is he?

473
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,710
Right behind you.

474
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:43,149
My God.

475
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,430
Frederick, what brings you here?

476
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,238
It all began 2000 years ago.

477
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,829
A crucifixion on the hill.

478
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,871
We went to look.

479
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,755
But we were punished.
Unfairly in my opinion.

480
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:14,037
Curiosity is a natural thing.

481
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,835
You knew it all the time in Argyle.
- Just like you.

482
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,713
What are you talking about?

483
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,913
I'm going to hurt you.
I would never do.

484
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,996
You know something is going to happen.
That's why you're here.

485
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,235
You're one of us, Cassie.

486
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,316
You just forgot.

487
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:45,470
We are previously condemned
always come back and watch.

488
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,910
And that's what happened.

489
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:52,910
Through the years we experienced
we could make us useful.

490
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:57,875
We can make sure that everything
in order for what must happen.

491
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:03,392
Ensure that there is nothing in the way.
- That's pathetic. That is obscene.

492
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:07,957
People see suffering and
there get a kick out of.

493
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,549
No, there's no rush.

494
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,270
We can not prevent
what is going to happen, Cassie.

495
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,070
Walk to the pump, Dan.

496
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,032
There is nothing you can do.

497
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,714
A warm welcome for doctor Byworth.
- Thanks.

498
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,070
Thank you.

499
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,156
Can you help me?
Can you help me push?

500
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:23,158
Sure.
- On the backside.

501
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,435
Are you done?
- Yes.

502
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:38,468
Can you start the engine?
- Faster.

503
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:43,390
Uncoupling.
- You're going to hit the wall!

504
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,990
My God.
- Get out of here!

505
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,711
Walk!

506
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,109
There's a bomb in that car! Walk!

507
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:04,191
You're a little late. You missed it.
I'm sorry if I blew it.

508
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,393
You do not have to gedaan.Je
seen it, you know it's coming.

509
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:12,388
He is going to be listed.
He now goes to Michael.

510
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,068
Michael is sitting on a train to London.

511
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,397
Michael join Emma in Lime Court.

512
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,513
Cassie ...
- Do not touch me.

513
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,469
It does not matter.

514
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,511
Marion!

515
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,553
Where is Marion?
- Cassie, is that you?

516
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:48,070
I can not reach Simon. The train has been canceled
and I thought we'd be safe here.

517
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,316
There is a man there.
- Marion ...

518
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,439
Cassie, take Michael.

519
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,950
Take Michael with you. Loop.

520
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,633
Walk! Come on.

521
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,237
The field.

522
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,550
Have you seen Marion?

523
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,471
Stay here.

524
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,711
Forward.

525
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:38,315
Marion? My God.
I'll call an ambulance.

526
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,670
The children. I am fine.

527
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,839
Get the kids.
Get the kids. I am fine.

528
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,958
Stay as low as possible.

529
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,198
Cassie!

530
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,952
No, please.

531
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,950
Cassie.

532
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,191
Cassie?

533
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:40,994
I saw that man to shoot you.
- Yes, he did.

534
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:46,638
But he can not hurt me.
Nobody can. I'm not like you.

535
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:54,158
A long time ago there was a
girl on a field outside the city.

536
01:15:55,320 --> 01:16:00,030
And she saw something that was very bad.

537
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:06,718
She stopped and looked.
That they did not do.

538
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:11,828
Why not?
- Because it was terrible.

539
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,156
She should stop
or try to help.

540
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:21,195
She could at least protest,
but she did not.

541
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,555
She just looked.

542
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,040
What has become of her?

543
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:41,995
She wandered around long.

544
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,794
And she was very unhappy.

545
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,838
But then she learned something important.

546
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:56,033
Everyone gets a second chance.
You have to seize only they know.

547
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,720
You need to sleep.
- I can not do that.

548
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,798
And what about the voices?

549
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:11,275
Who are away. You should
not be afraid anymore.

550
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,595
Are you going to stay with me, Cassie?
- No.

551
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:21,276
You do not need me.
We are both fairly, Michael.

552
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,556
Everthing allright?

553
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,790
Sleeping Time?

554
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,790
Do you want your bear?

555
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,792
Good night.

556
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,312
Good night.

557
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:38,399
