2
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:06,046
I think we can begin.

3
00:01:06,573 --> 00:01:08,928
The first parole request
for Carter "Doc" McCoy.

4
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:10,412
Is legal counsel present?

5
00:01:10,493 --> 00:01:13,485
Yes, sir. I'm Eugene Stewart,
representing Mr. McCoy.

00:01:19,173 --> 00:01:22,529

for armed robbery.

7
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,522
First offense in the state of Texas.

8
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:28,647
Wanted by the state of Ohio
for assauIt with a deadly weapon...

9
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:29,848
...and armed robbery.

10
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:33,005
The State of Ohio has waived jurisdiction,
Mr. Chairman.

11
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:36,012
Mr. McCoy is no longer wanted
in that case.

12
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:41,001
Good luck, man.

13
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:43,286
Mr. McCoy has served
four years of his sentence.

14
00:01:43,373 --> 00:01:45,045
His record's satisfactory.

15
00:01:45,613 --> 00:01:48,491
Applied for parole
on September fifth of this year.

16
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,648
Remarks?

17
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:54,201
I wouId only, once again,
like to point out to the committee...

18
00:01:54,293 --> 00:01:56,761
...Mr. McCoy's good behavior
while a prisoner.

19
00:01:56,853 --> 00:01:58,889
-Notice is taken.
-Thank you, sir.

20
00:01:58,973 --> 00:02:01,441
The board met
in closed chambers last week.

21
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:05,407
Have you reached a decision regarding
Mr. McCoy's request for parole?

22
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,370
Request for parole is denied.

23
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:10,804
The prisoner may re-apply
after one calendar year.

24
00:03:28,413 --> 00:03:29,687
Lock 'em up.

25
00:04:21,213 --> 00:04:22,612
Open the gate.

26
00:04:35,613 --> 00:04:39,128
Lance said to have eight hole,
Gallo one, Kirksky two.

27
00:04:39,853 --> 00:04:41,252
Eight hole colored.

28
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:45,203
Go down to the garden house,
turn to your left, go to the woods.

29
00:04:45,373 --> 00:04:49,446
We"re going on to the brush. Burn it.
Take the stumps up out of the ground.

30
00:04:49,653 --> 00:04:52,725
Bob Field, get them dogs out there
close to the trailer.

31
00:05:11,413 --> 00:05:12,448
One hole.

32
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:22,328
Eight hole.

33
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:31,442
Thirty.

34
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:32,888
Thirty.

35
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,322
Come on.

36
00:05:35,973 --> 00:05:38,009
-Fifteen.
-Fifteen.

37
00:05:41,213 --> 00:05:43,681
Get them dogs in close to 'em, Bob Field.

38
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:08,886
-Thirty.
-Thirty.

39
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,643
Hogfield, you go to the left
and start rounding up on that brush pile.

40
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:17,882
Time to go.

41
00:06:19,373 --> 00:06:21,603
Put it back. Catch them, this squad.

42
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:25,287
Round this pile up and get it burning.

43
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:30,650
Oh, man, that's just a game.

44
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:35,684
Man, get on this stump.

45
00:06:37,053 --> 00:06:38,611
Look out, McCoy.

46
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,772
Get your axe and come on up here
and pitch in.

47
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:46,284
Go to work. Go to work.

48
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:54,647
De Leon, get the fire going.

49
00:06:55,853 --> 00:06:57,525
That Mexican there--

50
00:06:57,653 --> 00:07:00,611
Get up all this little stuff
and put it on this pile.

51
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:04,642
Thirty.

52
00:07:04,893 --> 00:07:06,008
Eight hole.

53
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:08,892
Catch that brush pile here
and get it rounded up.

54
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:13,086
I want it tight to where it'll burn.
Get these stumps down under the ground.

55
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,002
Bob Field...

56
00:07:17,373 --> 00:07:18,931
...round up that pile.

57
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:21,806
Get it to burn.
Kirk Shaw, over on the ground....

58
00:07:28,653 --> 00:07:30,245
Keep that line straight.

59
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,212
Keep that line tight.

60
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:28,647
HeIIo, Doc.

61
00:08:38,173 --> 00:08:39,242
I'm sorry.

62
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:44,601
Get to Beynon.

63
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:47,002
Tell him I'm for sale. His price.

64
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:51,602
Do it now.

65
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,691
Hello, Mrs. McCoy.

66
00:09:06,453 --> 00:09:08,250
I'd like to see Jack Beynon.

67
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:13,842
Go ahead.

68
00:09:18,653 --> 00:09:20,006
Class. Is she a regular?

69
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,163
No. Doc McCoy's old lady.

70
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:24,125
Jeez, is that Carol Ainsley?

71
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:25,487
Shut up!

72
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:30,485
How are you, Mrs. McCoy?

73
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:34,721
Ready to taIk about my husband,
Mr. Beynon.

74
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:38,652
PIease sit down.

75
00:09:43,173 --> 00:09:45,289
So the good doctor comes up again.

76
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:50,284
He asked me to come and see you.

77
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:52,768
Why?

78
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:55,848
Can I help?

79
00:09:58,453 --> 00:10:00,011
Yes, I think you can.

80
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:06,326
How about a drink?

81
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:09,011
Yeah, I couId use one.

82
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:11,207
Come on over.

83
00:10:33,093 --> 00:10:34,572
You'll be back, Doc.

84
00:11:11,813 --> 00:11:14,452
Mr. Beynon will see you
the day after tomorrow.

85
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:16,809
12:30 at the River Walk.

86
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:08,446
-Hi, Doc.
-Hi.

87
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:11,688
Feel okay?

88
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:14,926
I'm a lot better off now
than I was an hour ago.

89
00:12:17,493 --> 00:12:20,405
-You want to drive?
-My driver's license has expired.

90
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:27,251
Sorry I'm late. I was having my hair done,
the girl was slow.

91
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,561
You look fine.

92
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:32,291
-You feel good?
-Yeah.

93
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:37,088
-Where do you want to go?
-Take a walk.

94
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,204
What do you want for dinner?

95
00:15:10,253 --> 00:15:12,483
Drinks. Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey....

96
00:15:55,973 --> 00:15:57,042
You okay?

97
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,561
Pretty good.

98
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,802
Made a trip to Oregon
to see my brother and his kids.

99
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:04,724
I figured it'd be
the last time I'd see them...

100
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:06,849
...unIess they decide to travel.

101
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,407
How's Estelle?

102
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:09,848
Fatter.

103
00:16:11,813 --> 00:16:13,883
You know, some things never change.

104
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:16,966
Yeah, that's right.

105
00:16:19,293 --> 00:16:20,806
That's not all of it.

106
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:24,651
It's been a long time, Doc.

107
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:27,492
Did you go out much?

108
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:31,607
Four years, and now
the question comes up.

109
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:43,524
I couldn't handle it inside.

110
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:45,127
But I can now.

111
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:47,852
I'm still here, Doc.

112
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:25,283
It does something to you, you know.

113
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:28,251
It does something to you.

114
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:33,363
It does something to you in there.

115
00:18:43,293 --> 00:18:45,602
We've got time, Doc.
We've got lots of time.

116
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:47,524
Just give me a minute, baby.

117
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:50,882
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.

118
00:18:53,093 --> 00:18:54,208
Really?

119
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:55,607
Really.

120
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,083
Let me make you feel good, Doctor.

121
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:14,005
It's been so long.

122
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:17,407
So long.

123
00:19:38,453 --> 00:19:39,602
Fantastic.

124
00:19:44,973 --> 00:19:46,167
She's here.

125
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,051
Hey, I was gonna fix you breakfast.

126
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:53,452
You were sleeping.

127
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:54,886
A little ketchup.

128
00:19:59,693 --> 00:20:01,524
And then we have a little....

129
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:10,728
Thank you.

130
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:14,884
-For what?
-For getting me out.

131
00:20:17,293 --> 00:20:18,692
It was a pleasure.

132
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:30,012
Thank you, ma'am.

133
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,801
Hey, Claude. Here's your boy.

134
00:20:46,973 --> 00:20:48,406
You have to be kidding.

135
00:20:48,493 --> 00:20:51,610
Not at all.
Just a pleasant way to have lunch.

136
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:53,242
Sit down.

137
00:20:55,973 --> 00:20:58,282
It's good to see you
in them civilian clothes.

138
00:20:58,373 --> 00:21:00,409
It just takes a Iong arm, Beynon.

139
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:05,211
You know, it's hard to say
how those things happen.

140
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:09,365
The parole board aImost never
changes their decision.

141
00:21:10,373 --> 00:21:12,762
It must be because I'm a model prisoner.

142
00:21:14,893 --> 00:21:17,532
This is the onIy time
you and I meet in public.

143
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,245
Any business with me...

144
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,485
...you handle it with him.

145
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,052
He's my brother.

146
00:21:25,373 --> 00:21:27,284
Back with your own peopIe, now.

147
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,330
I got you some professionals.

148
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:31,684
I'll get my own men, Beynon.

149
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,893
You run the job, but I run the show.

150
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,766
And don't forget it.

151
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:46,323
You've got two weeks to set it up.

152
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:51,292
It's not a big bank, but it handles
the cash deposits for an oil company.

153
00:21:52,253 --> 00:21:54,084
Over half a million dollars.

154
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,646
It's a family bank.

155
00:21:57,253 --> 00:21:58,572
The brother of the bank director...

156
00:21:58,653 --> 00:22:02,009
...is on the board of directors
at Con-Sol Oil in Beacon City.

157
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:12,086
Here's a couple of fellas
I'd like you to meet.

158
00:22:13,213 --> 00:22:14,965
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson.

159
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:22,691
Yeah, I've heard of you.

160
00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:24,286
You work with Miller?

161
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:26,571
You're out of touch, Doc.

162
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,526
Miller got blown up.

163
00:22:31,773 --> 00:22:32,762
Where?

164
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:34,852
Fort Lauderdale.

165
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:37,491
-Were you with him?
-Yeah.

166
00:22:39,493 --> 00:22:40,562
I got out.

167
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:43,128
You?

168
00:22:43,893 --> 00:22:45,963
I was backup man on a payroll job.

169
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:49,165
I'd hit some liquor stores. I drive good.

170
00:22:49,253 --> 00:22:50,322
I drive.

171
00:22:51,853 --> 00:22:53,127
Sure.

172
00:22:54,813 --> 00:22:57,088
I want Mexican visas and passports.

173
00:22:57,613 --> 00:22:59,126
They'll be ready.

174
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:01,605
You boys just do your job.

175
00:23:09,373 --> 00:23:10,408
Carol.

176
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:13,132
Bank guard, 7:59.

177
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:14,642
He's early.

178
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:25,161
You got a flashlight, some light batteries.

179
00:23:25,853 --> 00:23:28,413
A-hooks, pliers, wire cutters....

180
00:23:33,293 --> 00:23:35,443
What do you want all this stuff for?

181
00:23:35,773 --> 00:23:38,207
-I'm going on a picnic.
-Going on a picnic?

182
00:23:39,013 --> 00:23:40,366
WeII...okay.

183
00:23:46,813 --> 00:23:50,488
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
especially you gentlemen....

184
00:23:50,813 --> 00:23:54,931
We very proudly present
the pride and joy of Beacon City.

185
00:23:55,213 --> 00:23:58,125
Our own high-stepping and high-kicking...

186
00:23:58,213 --> 00:24:00,283
...Southwest Texas Ropers.

187
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:26,242
Following the strutters...
representing the Ladies Auxiliary of...

188
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:30,451
...the Volunteer Fire Brigade.
We have the first beautiful float...

189
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:34,885
...which consists of the Constitution
in the history of the Lone Star State.

190
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:51,682
Good morning.

191
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:53,889
I'd like an application
for a checking account, pIease.

192
00:24:53,973 --> 00:24:57,648
He goes here, follows down here.
Now, this is the spot you're looking for.

193
00:24:57,733 --> 00:24:58,927
Here. Yeah.

194
00:24:59,053 --> 00:25:01,169
-Can I get a copy of this?
-Yes, sir.

195
00:25:10,373 --> 00:25:12,250
-Thanks a lot.
-You're welcome.

196
00:25:33,413 --> 00:25:35,131
Change for a $50, please.

197
00:25:40,293 --> 00:25:42,124
$20, $30...

198
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:45,447
...$40, $45, $50.

199
00:25:46,653 --> 00:25:49,167
Thank you.
Y'all come back and see us soon.

200
00:25:51,493 --> 00:25:54,053
Set your clocks for five minutes after 9:00.

201
00:25:55,653 --> 00:25:57,564
All right, on the nose, now.

202
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,447
The diversionary explosions are spaced
20 seconds apart.

203
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:02,886
That gives you...

204
00:26:03,493 --> 00:26:06,132
...one minute and 38 seconds,
before they blow.

205
00:26:09,213 --> 00:26:12,125
You've got a bank president,
you have three tellers.

206
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:15,012
And you've got a bank guard.

207
00:26:15,093 --> 00:26:16,367
Usually on the right as you come in.

208
00:26:16,453 --> 00:26:17,886
Pin him right away.

209
00:26:18,013 --> 00:26:20,686
Careful he doesn't panic,
and go shoot somebody.

210
00:26:22,093 --> 00:26:24,971
You got one local police car.
Now he's a rover.

211
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:28,485
ShouIdn't be anywhere near the vicinity
when we make our hit.

212
00:26:28,573 --> 00:26:30,564
Traffic is usually light at that hour.

213
00:26:30,653 --> 00:26:33,770
There are three exits. One at Hopkins,
one at Guadalupe Street...

214
00:26:33,853 --> 00:26:35,445
...and then there's the alley.

215
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:37,967
Will you put that away and pay attention!

216
00:26:41,493 --> 00:26:43,324
Now the guard carries a .38.

217
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:48,211
The cops carry 357-magnums.

218
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:53,291
You know what this is.

219
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,127
This'll stop an M-2 army rifle at 50 yards.

220
00:27:00,173 --> 00:27:02,562
I've been working ten years without one.

221
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:06,764
-Suit yourself.
-Thank you.

222
00:27:07,453 --> 00:27:08,647
What about the vault?

223
00:27:08,733 --> 00:27:09,927
It's a Chambers Reilly.

224
00:27:10,013 --> 00:27:12,971
It's on a time lock.
Opens up 20 minutes before office hours.

225
00:27:13,053 --> 00:27:13,929
Wire pull over?

226
00:27:14,013 --> 00:27:16,766
No, one-inch stuff
on a three number combination.

227
00:27:16,893 --> 00:27:18,008
That's me.

228
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:21,769
No, no. I'll handIe the fine stuff.
You're backup aII the way.

229
00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:24,885
Whatever you need, brother.

230
00:27:25,653 --> 00:27:26,722
Right.

231
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:32,650
You keep going over this.
I don't want anybody lost.

232
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:35,927
If we're clean,
Gollie will take us across at Laredo.

233
00:27:36,013 --> 00:27:39,005
If we're hot, we'II have to try Laughlin's
in El Paso.

234
00:27:43,293 --> 00:27:45,363
Aren't we going a little bit hard?

235
00:27:50,893 --> 00:27:52,611
That's a walk-in bank, man.

236
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,487
A piece of cake.

237
00:27:56,573 --> 00:27:59,133
You don't have to be Dillinger for that one.

238
00:28:05,453 --> 00:28:06,408
Bang.

239
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:18,406
Dillinger got killed.

240
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:22,812
Not in the bank.

241
00:28:26,613 --> 00:28:28,012
Take it with you.

242
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:49,202
Expenses.

243
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:58,443
Tell Beynon I don't want any mix-ups.
I make one phone call.

244
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:02,047
And his people better be there.
All of them.

245
00:29:04,373 --> 00:29:05,362
I understand.

246
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:06,647
Beynon's to be alone at the drop.

247
00:29:06,733 --> 00:29:09,611
OnIy one car in the garage
at the ranch and that's it.

248
00:29:09,693 --> 00:29:11,126
Now, I'm not gonna have the money.

249
00:29:11,213 --> 00:29:14,967
And she's not gonna know where it is
until I know I'm clear. Got it?

250
00:29:15,813 --> 00:29:17,565
-He understands.
-Good, good.

251
00:29:17,653 --> 00:29:19,848
Make sure everybody does. Okay?

252
00:30:11,613 --> 00:30:13,524
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

253
00:30:16,053 --> 00:30:17,884
Good morning.

254
00:30:18,813 --> 00:30:19,962
Good morning.

255
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:29,282
Good morning.

256
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,722
Good morning, Mr. Morgan. How are you?

257
00:30:34,813 --> 00:30:36,087
Fine, thank you.

258
00:31:43,053 --> 00:31:44,042
HoId it.

259
00:32:05,693 --> 00:32:07,012
Come on, move it!

260
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,128
ReIax.

261
00:32:59,373 --> 00:33:01,682
Superior technoIogy, my ass.

262
00:33:13,413 --> 00:33:14,732
Hands up!

263
00:33:21,773 --> 00:33:23,411
Mr. President? Up!

264
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,925
Everybody, out this way.

265
00:33:35,853 --> 00:33:38,970
Come on, come on! Hurry it up! Move it!

266
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:42,688
Go!

267
00:33:48,253 --> 00:33:50,005
Come on, move it!

268
00:33:54,213 --> 00:33:55,885
Come on, honey, get on it.

269
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:14,889
Now just relax.

270
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:16,727
Face down!

271
00:34:33,253 --> 00:34:35,289
Move it. Move it, honey.

272
00:34:37,573 --> 00:34:39,768
They're on their way. Just relax.

273
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:42,966
Everybody relax.

274
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:33,727
Ninety seconds.

275
00:35:58,653 --> 00:35:59,608
Seventy-five.

276
00:36:04,653 --> 00:36:05,768
Sixty-five.

277
00:36:09,013 --> 00:36:10,241
Fifty, brother.

278
00:36:22,093 --> 00:36:22,969
No!

279
00:36:23,293 --> 00:36:24,169
No!

280
00:36:32,413 --> 00:36:33,641
Stupid bastard!

281
00:36:52,613 --> 00:36:53,841
Take the wheel.

282
00:36:54,293 --> 00:36:55,521
Take the wheel.

283
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:24,682
How did it go?

284
00:37:24,773 --> 00:37:26,923
Bad. Jackson killed the guard.

285
00:37:33,813 --> 00:37:36,327
Fourteen seconds till the next one goes off.

286
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:40,324
Come on, come on.

287
00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:34,168
Shit.

288
00:40:06,453 --> 00:40:07,727
Where's Jackson?

289
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:10,572
He didn't make it.

290
00:40:11,053 --> 00:40:12,406
Neither did you.

291
00:41:57,613 --> 00:42:00,173
...was held up this morning
shortly after opening.

292
00:42:00,253 --> 00:42:04,485
The bank officials state that $750,000
was taken by three masked men...

293
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:05,802
...who forced the employees....

294
00:42:05,893 --> 00:42:07,849
Hey, there's onIy $500,000 here.

295
00:42:07,933 --> 00:42:09,810
-You sure?
-Yes, I'm sure.

296
00:42:12,933 --> 00:42:13,843
Doc?

297
00:42:14,493 --> 00:42:16,370
I see it. Take it easy.

298
00:42:16,573 --> 00:42:18,928
They're looking for three men, remember?

299
00:42:33,173 --> 00:42:35,448
What seems to be the problem, Officer?

300
00:42:40,213 --> 00:42:41,441
Okay, drive on.

301
00:43:12,653 --> 00:43:13,847
I'll kill him.

302
00:43:15,373 --> 00:43:16,886
I'll kill that mother!

303
00:43:24,413 --> 00:43:25,448
He's on.

304
00:43:27,013 --> 00:43:28,082
I'm here.

305
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:30,688
Yeah?

306
00:43:32,173 --> 00:43:33,083
Yeah?

307
00:43:34,733 --> 00:43:35,768
I'm here.

308
00:43:50,493 --> 00:43:51,892
They checked in.

309
00:44:04,653 --> 00:44:06,371
TeII me about Beynon's ranch.

310
00:44:06,453 --> 00:44:08,045
I've never been there.

311
00:44:09,053 --> 00:44:11,089
When we met, it was at his office.

312
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:17,972
Do you trust him?

313
00:44:18,973 --> 00:44:21,123
I don't figure he's gonna try to cross us.

314
00:44:21,213 --> 00:44:23,443
At least not until he gets his money.

315
00:44:23,693 --> 00:44:26,685
WeII, let's just send his cut back
and just get going.

316
00:44:29,213 --> 00:44:31,602
If we make a mistake, he's gonna burn us.

317
00:44:31,973 --> 00:44:34,567
You make a deal,
you're better off keeping up your end.

318
00:44:34,653 --> 00:44:36,371
I don't want to go there.

319
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:39,766
Let's do it my way.

320
00:45:17,053 --> 00:45:18,088
Stay here.

321
00:45:19,973 --> 00:45:22,043
I'II wrap it up as quick as I can.

322
00:46:04,093 --> 00:46:05,924
News said two peopIe killed.

323
00:46:06,093 --> 00:46:08,402
Three. Rudy got ambitious.

324
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:10,206
And you got him.

325
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:12,482
That's right.

326
00:46:12,573 --> 00:46:14,165
What about your wife?

327
00:46:14,973 --> 00:46:16,167
Let's cut up the money, Beynon.

328
00:46:16,253 --> 00:46:17,766
I want to get north.

329
00:46:19,093 --> 00:46:21,243
She toId me no one wouId get killed.

330
00:46:30,933 --> 00:46:32,525
I'm in a hurry, Beynon.

331
00:46:32,733 --> 00:46:35,122
You still don't get the picture, do you?

332
00:46:35,933 --> 00:46:38,970
And I've always heard
what a smart-ass operator you was.

333
00:46:39,293 --> 00:46:40,487
No applause.

334
00:46:43,293 --> 00:46:45,124
Let's examine the situation.

335
00:46:46,733 --> 00:46:49,486
One. An extremely attractive woman.

336
00:46:56,373 --> 00:46:58,329
And there's the woman's husband.

337
00:46:58,413 --> 00:47:00,881
And there's a man with political influence.

338
00:47:01,533 --> 00:47:04,366
A man who can easily get a parole
for a convict.

339
00:47:05,493 --> 00:47:06,812
Why shouId he?

340
00:47:07,173 --> 00:47:08,686
A simple reason, McCoy.

341
00:47:08,773 --> 00:47:10,331
Let's get down to it.

342
00:47:10,533 --> 00:47:12,728
Radio's rapping about $750,000.

343
00:47:13,453 --> 00:47:15,409
There's a half a million, here.

344
00:47:17,373 --> 00:47:19,443
A little more was taken out before.

345
00:47:20,173 --> 00:47:22,892
You see, my brother's
the director of that bank.

346
00:47:23,133 --> 00:47:25,567
We had a few probIems we had to iron out.

347
00:47:28,493 --> 00:47:30,370
Okay. We covered you....

348
00:47:31,973 --> 00:47:32,849
Yeah.

349
00:47:33,213 --> 00:47:34,726
You surely did, Doc.

350
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:44,406
My old lady must've made you
a lot of promises.

351
00:47:45,413 --> 00:47:46,402
Close.

352
00:47:46,933 --> 00:47:48,286
I wouldn't feel--

353
00:49:56,973 --> 00:49:57,928
Stupid!

354
00:49:59,053 --> 00:50:00,884
Why didn't you tell me, huh?

355
00:50:01,053 --> 00:50:02,611
Why didn't you tell me?

356
00:50:02,693 --> 00:50:04,888
There wasn't any way to explain it.

357
00:50:10,853 --> 00:50:12,730
You sent me to him, you know.

358
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,929
What the hell do you want anyway?

359
00:50:44,573 --> 00:50:45,767
Goddamn you!

360
00:51:07,493 --> 00:51:08,767
Still no answer.

361
00:51:09,253 --> 00:51:10,606
Something's wrong.

362
00:51:12,293 --> 00:51:14,648
Come on! Come on!

363
00:51:19,933 --> 00:51:21,332
What's the damage?

364
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:25,922
Your collarbone's broken
but it's not shattered.

365
00:51:26,013 --> 00:51:27,731
There's no infection, yet.

366
00:51:28,053 --> 00:51:30,647
Those bandages ought
to be changed twice a day.

367
00:51:31,613 --> 00:51:32,762
It's okay.

368
00:51:33,373 --> 00:51:35,091
I got a nurse in mind.

369
00:51:38,133 --> 00:51:40,647
The three of us are gonna
do some traveling.

370
00:51:43,013 --> 00:51:45,208
We're gonna take your car to El Paso.

371
00:51:46,293 --> 00:51:48,249
We...we can't leave here.

372
00:51:50,573 --> 00:51:53,326
That's not possible.
I mean, we have all of this.

373
00:51:57,133 --> 00:51:59,089
Is that possible, Mrs. Clinton?

374
00:52:01,253 --> 00:52:03,050
Just tell us what you want.

375
00:52:09,613 --> 00:52:11,331
What kind of a car do you drive?

376
00:52:11,413 --> 00:52:13,085
A Ford. We have a Ford.

377
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,287
That's good.

378
00:52:21,533 --> 00:52:23,205
That's very good, Harold.

379
00:52:23,973 --> 00:52:26,123
You run on out and gas up the Ford.

380
00:52:27,373 --> 00:52:30,251
If anybody but you comes back, Harold...

381
00:52:31,693 --> 00:52:33,649
...she gets her clock stopped.

382
00:52:38,373 --> 00:52:40,329
You do what he says, Harold.

383
00:52:41,293 --> 00:52:42,646
Just do as I say.

384
00:52:59,813 --> 00:53:01,963
You. Get a cloth.

385
00:53:02,973 --> 00:53:04,486
You're gonna wash me.

386
00:53:10,773 --> 00:53:12,729
They still may be on the way to Laredo.

387
00:53:12,813 --> 00:53:15,532
What about El Paso?
He's a friend of Laughlin.

388
00:53:16,133 --> 00:53:17,361
WeII, we have to cover them both.

389
00:53:17,453 --> 00:53:19,444
We've got to get somebody down there.
Either Rudy or...

390
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:21,808
...McCoy's got a half a million bucks.

391
00:53:22,053 --> 00:53:24,169
-Put out the word.
-What about Jack?

392
00:53:25,933 --> 00:53:28,322
Just dump him down a dry well,
if you can find one.

393
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,449
No, he ought to be buried proper.

394
00:53:31,773 --> 00:53:33,604
You just do what I tell you.

395
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:37,766
Thank you, ma'am.

396
00:53:41,653 --> 00:53:43,132
Wendy, sit down.

397
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:46,969
Two day-coach tickets to El Paso.

398
00:53:52,253 --> 00:53:55,450
Leaves in 45 minutes. Gate three.
Thank you, ma'am.

399
00:54:54,773 --> 00:54:56,411
Kind of tricky, isn't it?

400
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:04,051
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

401
00:55:18,133 --> 00:55:19,407
Come over here.

402
00:55:35,413 --> 00:55:37,847
You don't always have to
take your gun out.

403
00:55:40,533 --> 00:55:42,285
I'll do anything you want.

404
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:44,562
Really.

405
00:55:45,213 --> 00:55:46,202
I will.

406
00:55:51,533 --> 00:55:53,364
Get rid of that nail polish.

407
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:55,769
Okay.

408
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:57,406
I don't like it.

409
00:56:09,653 --> 00:56:11,291
And get rid of that, too.

410
00:56:12,093 --> 00:56:13,242
What is that?

411
00:56:36,013 --> 00:56:38,447
Don't get any blood on me. I hate blood.

412
00:56:47,493 --> 00:56:50,326
Say, you wouIdn't happen to be
a Mormon, wouId you?

413
00:56:51,813 --> 00:56:53,246
No, I'm afraid not.

414
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:54,402
I'd like another one.

415
00:56:54,493 --> 00:56:55,721
Me, neither.

416
00:56:56,253 --> 00:56:58,813
I'm from Orem. That's right near Salt Lake.

417
00:56:59,613 --> 00:57:03,765
There's about 12 people in the state who
aren't Mormons, and I'm one of them.

418
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:08,642
I guess that makes you kind of special.

419
00:57:09,453 --> 00:57:11,921
-Yeah, I guess it does.
-Thank you.

420
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:13,882
Hey, baby.

421
00:57:16,373 --> 00:57:18,807
You wouldn't be taking the train
to Salt Lake, would you?

422
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,372
No, I'm afraid not!

423
00:57:20,693 --> 00:57:22,012
That's just my luck.

424
00:57:22,093 --> 00:57:23,845
Listen, I hope you have a really nice trip.

425
00:57:23,933 --> 00:57:26,083
Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.

426
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:30,727
Where's the bag?

427
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:32,610
It's in the locker. I've got the key.

428
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:10,808
A man helped me open it.

429
00:58:10,893 --> 00:58:12,167
How long ago?

430
00:58:12,893 --> 00:58:14,372
Fifteen minutes ago.

431
00:58:19,293 --> 00:58:22,808
It's the oldest con game in the world.
He switched keys with you.

432
00:58:27,613 --> 00:58:30,446
He'll figure you for more time.
He's probabIy still in the station.

433
00:58:30,533 --> 00:58:31,602
Find him.

434
00:58:57,653 --> 00:59:01,851
Your attention please. The Lone Star Flyer
for...and El Paso now boarding.

435
00:59:07,653 --> 00:59:09,245
Your attention, please.

436
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:12,405
The Lone Star Flyer for...

437
00:59:13,453 --> 00:59:15,728
...El Paso now boarding on track site.

438
00:59:25,933 --> 00:59:27,969
-There you are, ma'am.
-Thank you.

439
00:59:44,253 --> 00:59:47,290
You have coach number six.
You've got coach number four.

440
00:59:47,453 --> 00:59:49,171
You have coach number two.

441
00:59:49,413 --> 00:59:51,290
-My aunt forgot her bag.
-Yes, sir.

442
00:59:51,373 --> 00:59:52,692
Coach number six.

443
00:59:53,213 --> 00:59:56,091
Coach number four. Coach number three.

444
00:59:59,213 --> 01:00:01,522
-I'm gonna see somebody off.
-AII right.

445
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:19,891
Your attention, please.

446
01:00:19,973 --> 01:00:23,682
Last call for the Lone Star Flyer
now leaving at track site.

447
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:27,402
Last call for the Lone Star Flyer
now leaving at track site.

448
01:00:40,613 --> 01:00:44,572
That's awfully heavy. To save my life,
I can't possibly lift it up there.

449
01:00:45,893 --> 01:00:46,962
Thank you.

450
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:49,051
That's coach number one.

451
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:50,612
That's coach three.

452
01:01:06,773 --> 01:01:08,843
Y'all gonna miss the train, you know?

453
01:01:08,933 --> 01:01:11,049
Car number three, right over there.

454
01:01:11,133 --> 01:01:12,566
All aboard!

455
01:02:24,253 --> 01:02:26,847
It'll be open five minutes out of the station.

456
01:04:01,853 --> 01:04:03,445
Tickets, pIease.

457
01:04:51,573 --> 01:04:52,892
Tickets, pIease.

458
01:04:53,133 --> 01:04:55,966
When you work on a lock,
don't leave any scratches.

459
01:05:18,493 --> 01:05:19,892
Tickets pIease.

460
01:05:20,253 --> 01:05:21,845
Two. End of the line.

461
01:05:25,133 --> 01:05:26,725
I'll get you.

462
01:05:40,893 --> 01:05:42,246
Stick 'em up!

463
01:05:44,773 --> 01:05:47,207
I said, "Stick 'em up or I'll shoot you."

464
01:05:55,693 --> 01:05:56,808
Now, listen...

465
01:05:56,893 --> 01:06:00,249
...I know you're a good kid.
Now, get back there with your mother.

466
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:03,325
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna break your little arm.

467
01:06:04,373 --> 01:06:05,362
Okay?

468
01:06:11,813 --> 01:06:13,371
Your attention, please.

469
01:06:13,453 --> 01:06:16,490
The 7:10 Special arriving
from Dallas and Fort Worth...

470
01:06:16,613 --> 01:06:18,604
...has been 20 minutes delayed.

471
01:06:19,213 --> 01:06:21,807
Next stop: AIpine, Texas.

472
01:06:22,013 --> 01:06:24,686
Next stop: AIpine, Texas.

473
01:06:44,093 --> 01:06:45,924
Talk it up a little, Harold.

474
01:06:47,053 --> 01:06:48,691
It'd be good for you.

475
01:06:50,213 --> 01:06:51,487
Loosen you up.

476
01:06:53,533 --> 01:06:55,603
Something ought to loosen him up.

477
01:06:57,373 --> 01:06:59,443
Something ought to loosen him up.

478
01:07:00,013 --> 01:07:02,288
What are we going to El Paso for, Rudy?

479
01:07:04,213 --> 01:07:05,931
I'm looking for a suitcase.

480
01:07:06,053 --> 01:07:07,645
At the Laughlin Hotel.

481
01:07:12,613 --> 01:07:13,762
You Laughlin?

482
01:07:13,853 --> 01:07:15,571
Yes, sir, all the time.

483
01:07:16,253 --> 01:07:18,642
This is my wife and that there's Junior.

484
01:07:20,733 --> 01:07:22,007
Congratulations.

485
01:07:22,173 --> 01:07:24,448
-I need a room.
-You don't have to look any farther.

486
01:07:24,533 --> 01:07:26,808
One thing we got here is lots of rooms.

487
01:07:26,973 --> 01:07:28,372
Sign right there.

488
01:07:29,133 --> 01:07:30,885
That'll be $5 in advance.

489
01:07:31,533 --> 01:07:32,568
Junior...

490
01:07:33,373 --> 01:07:35,489
...show this gentleman to his room.

491
01:07:37,373 --> 01:07:39,284
Checking-out time is 1:00 p.m.

492
01:07:39,573 --> 01:07:41,484
No girls allowed in the rooms.

493
01:07:41,653 --> 01:07:42,802
House rules.

494
01:08:08,093 --> 01:08:09,572
Call the conductor.

495
01:08:10,493 --> 01:08:12,245
Mama, Mama, Mama....

496
01:08:12,453 --> 01:08:13,932
Your attention, please.

497
01:08:14,013 --> 01:08:17,130
Shuttle train from Alpine
now arriving at track site.

498
01:08:17,533 --> 01:08:20,570
Shuttle train from Alpine
now arriving at track site.

499
01:08:49,213 --> 01:08:50,566
You're all right.

500
01:08:51,053 --> 01:08:52,645
How did you get it back?

501
01:08:53,813 --> 01:08:55,326
If you're trying to get me back
in Huntsville...

502
01:08:55,413 --> 01:08:57,802
...you're going about it in the right way.

503
01:08:57,893 --> 01:09:00,930
I wouIdn't worry about it,
'cause I can always get you out.

504
01:09:01,013 --> 01:09:04,164
I mean, I can screw every prison official
in Texas, if I want to.

505
01:09:04,253 --> 01:09:05,766
Texas is a big state.

506
01:09:05,853 --> 01:09:08,083
-I can handle it.
-Yeah, I bet you can.

507
01:09:15,133 --> 01:09:17,647
You'd do the same for me, Doc,
wouldn't you?

508
01:09:17,973 --> 01:09:20,248
I mean, if I got caught, wouldn't you?

509
01:09:32,413 --> 01:09:36,008
You don't like the way things are,
I don't like the way things are.

510
01:09:36,093 --> 01:09:37,367
What are we gonna do about it?

511
01:09:37,453 --> 01:09:39,125
Maybe we shouId split up.

512
01:09:40,493 --> 01:09:42,404
I'll cut up the money with you.

513
01:09:44,733 --> 01:09:46,849
-Do you mean that?
-Yeah, I mean it.

514
01:09:52,013 --> 01:09:53,605
Well, I don't want to.

515
01:10:13,373 --> 01:10:14,647
I have to stop.

516
01:10:15,093 --> 01:10:16,128
Not now.

517
01:10:16,293 --> 01:10:18,727
We have to beat that suitcase to El Paso.

518
01:10:35,933 --> 01:10:38,003
We'II grab a hotel room, tonight.

519
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:39,971
First thing tomorrow...

520
01:10:40,733 --> 01:10:43,008
...just go out and buy us another car.

521
01:10:43,213 --> 01:10:45,602
Then you go out,
buy yourself some other clothes.

522
01:10:45,693 --> 01:10:47,331
And pick up some for me.

523
01:10:47,893 --> 01:10:49,963
Tonight, I want you to go out....

524
01:10:50,773 --> 01:10:52,570
You go out and get some food.
Paper bag it.

525
01:10:52,653 --> 01:10:54,371
We'll eat it in the hotel room.

526
01:10:54,453 --> 01:10:56,648
What happens when they find the body?

527
01:10:57,533 --> 01:10:59,489
All they've got is a description.

528
01:10:59,573 --> 01:11:02,531
Cops need a connection to channel it,
and they haven't got it.

529
01:11:02,613 --> 01:11:04,171
It ain't gonna do them any good.

530
01:11:04,253 --> 01:11:06,164
You've got it all figured out, don't you?

531
01:11:06,253 --> 01:11:07,129
No.

532
01:11:09,053 --> 01:11:10,771
There's a few of things I'm working on.

533
01:11:10,853 --> 01:11:11,968
Like what?

534
01:11:12,093 --> 01:11:13,526
Where'd you get it?

535
01:11:17,253 --> 01:11:18,606
It was a gift.

536
01:11:21,693 --> 01:11:24,253
-Chico, get Lt.Judson down here.
-Yes, sir.

537
01:11:29,653 --> 01:11:31,245
CaII a medical officer, too.

538
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:33,289
Come on, boys,
let's look at some photographs.

539
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:34,408
Yes, sir.

540
01:11:39,053 --> 01:11:41,203
If Rudy was by himself, we're okay.

541
01:11:41,613 --> 01:11:43,331
If he worked for Beynon...

542
01:11:45,933 --> 01:11:49,369
...Beynon's peopIe will be waiting for us
at Laughlin's in El Paso.

543
01:11:49,453 --> 01:11:50,932
You're full of "ifs"

544
01:11:52,253 --> 01:11:53,606
So are you, baby.

545
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:01,684
I think you liked it with him.

546
01:12:03,773 --> 01:12:05,286
I think he got to you.

547
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:08,288
Maybe.

548
01:12:09,613 --> 01:12:11,126
At least I got to him.

549
01:12:12,853 --> 01:12:14,047
What about this one, boys?

550
01:12:14,133 --> 01:12:16,249
-Yeah. Yeah, that's him!
-Yeah, that's the guy!

551
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:18,085
-That's the one!
-That's him, all right.

552
01:12:18,173 --> 01:12:19,765
That's the man, Officer.

553
01:12:20,413 --> 01:12:22,483
That's the one you shot, Raymond.

554
01:12:24,493 --> 01:12:25,687
What about him?

555
01:12:28,853 --> 01:12:32,448
Listen, I'm a friend of the court, right?
That's why I'm here.

556
01:12:33,413 --> 01:12:35,483
You're here because you're under arrest.

557
01:12:35,573 --> 01:12:36,688
Lock him up.

558
01:12:37,813 --> 01:12:41,123
The man has been positively identified
as Carter "Doc" McCoy...

559
01:12:41,213 --> 01:12:43,807
...only recently paroled
from Huntsville Penitentiary.

560
01:12:43,893 --> 01:12:47,408
He is believed to be traveling
with his wife, Carol Ainsley McCoy.

561
01:12:47,493 --> 01:12:49,529
Stay tuned for further details.

562
01:12:50,293 --> 01:12:52,124
How you doing there, Harold?

563
01:12:59,613 --> 01:13:01,649
Do I have to take it off again?

564
01:13:01,973 --> 01:13:03,292
The radio, off.

565
01:13:29,253 --> 01:13:30,447
Come on, work!

566
01:13:34,653 --> 01:13:36,006
Give me the news!

567
01:13:40,533 --> 01:13:42,410
Can't trust a thing nowadays.

568
01:13:43,213 --> 01:13:47,286
TeII you something. One of these days,
you're gonna have to trust somebody.

569
01:13:48,293 --> 01:13:49,362
I trust.

570
01:13:56,733 --> 01:13:58,610
You want to see what I trust?

571
01:14:00,693 --> 01:14:02,012
"In God I trust."

572
01:14:02,493 --> 01:14:04,927
It's the words on the back of every bill.

573
01:14:06,413 --> 01:14:09,849
Just keep that up, Doc,
and it won't matter how far we get away.

574
01:14:10,773 --> 01:14:13,241
'Cause there won't be
anything left between us.

575
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:14,812
You understand that?

576
01:14:15,373 --> 01:14:16,408
Nothing.

577
01:14:32,133 --> 01:14:33,248
Pull over.

578
01:14:53,533 --> 01:14:54,568
Yes, sir.

579
01:14:55,453 --> 01:14:57,444
Yeah. I'd like to have a radio.

580
01:14:57,613 --> 01:14:58,648
One of those portables.

581
01:14:58,733 --> 01:15:01,406
All right, sir. We got them
from $15 to $55.

582
01:15:01,533 --> 01:15:02,568
Take your pick.

583
01:15:02,653 --> 01:15:04,564
-A $15 job.
-All right, sir.

584
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:06,849
...Beacon City bank robbery last week...

585
01:15:06,933 --> 01:15:11,370
...where they, along with two accomplices,
made off with more than three quarters--

586
01:15:16,613 --> 01:15:19,207
That'll be, $15.95 and 60 cents tax, sir.

587
01:15:19,933 --> 01:15:21,446
I'll get your change.

588
01:15:27,373 --> 01:15:29,045
Want your change, sir?

589
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:39,007
Now we got troubIe. Let's clear the car.

590
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:48,521
Yes, sir, can I help you?

591
01:15:48,613 --> 01:15:50,888
I want a shotgun, 12-gauge pump.

592
01:15:51,973 --> 01:15:54,646
-How about this one right here?
-Yeah, that's fine. Wrap it up.

593
01:15:54,733 --> 01:15:57,008
Sir, you'll have to sign this form here.

594
01:15:57,093 --> 01:15:59,971
And let me have a pack
of those doubIe-ought bucks.

595
01:16:00,493 --> 01:16:03,007
What are you going to do,
knock a wall down?

596
01:16:07,773 --> 01:16:11,163
Sir, you'll have to...
have to fill out these forms here, sir.

597
01:16:17,013 --> 01:16:18,605
You know what this is, don't you, mister?

598
01:16:18,693 --> 01:16:19,603
Yeah.

599
01:16:20,053 --> 01:16:22,362
All right, now wrap that up. Let's go.

600
01:16:26,013 --> 01:16:28,004
I don't know where they went to.

601
01:16:37,973 --> 01:16:40,248
Operator, get me the police.

602
01:16:41,773 --> 01:16:44,651
There's this car here,
and the man's in there, too.

603
01:16:45,213 --> 01:16:46,441
You might...

604
01:16:46,533 --> 01:16:49,093
...try down here or up there. I don't know.

605
01:16:50,813 --> 01:16:53,122
Call Willie up. That lady right there.

606
01:17:06,813 --> 01:17:08,087
Hold it! Right there!

607
01:17:08,173 --> 01:17:10,243
Get those guns out on the street.

608
01:17:10,813 --> 01:17:12,132
Kick them over.

609
01:17:13,693 --> 01:17:15,570
Now, lay down in that gutter!

610
01:17:16,533 --> 01:17:17,807
In the gutter!

611
01:17:21,493 --> 01:17:23,131
You, keep your face down!

612
01:17:55,453 --> 01:17:57,569
What the hell's the matter with you?

613
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:38,962
Hang a "U"

614
01:18:45,533 --> 01:18:46,807
Punch it, baby.

615
01:18:53,373 --> 01:18:54,408
Go ahead.

616
01:19:09,693 --> 01:19:10,967
In there.

617
01:19:44,573 --> 01:19:47,167
-How much to Dallas?
-Sixteen dollars.

618
01:20:30,933 --> 01:20:32,082
Hey, dummy!

619
01:20:35,933 --> 01:20:37,525
How you doing, Slim?

620
01:20:38,173 --> 01:20:39,162
Where you going?

621
01:20:39,253 --> 01:20:40,322
Mexico.

622
01:20:41,213 --> 01:20:42,532
How much did you pay for that thing?

623
01:20:42,613 --> 01:20:43,568
$2,800.

624
01:20:45,453 --> 01:20:46,852
Come on, let's go.

625
01:21:07,493 --> 01:21:08,846
Here, Harold.

626
01:21:09,653 --> 01:21:10,608
Here.

627
01:21:13,653 --> 01:21:14,881
Kitty.

628
01:21:15,533 --> 01:21:16,886
Have a rib bone.

629
01:21:24,093 --> 01:21:25,526
Have another rib.

630
01:21:29,133 --> 01:21:30,407
Christ, Rudy...

631
01:21:30,853 --> 01:21:32,286
...you ruined my skirt.

632
01:21:32,373 --> 01:21:35,171
Goddamn it, what'd you do that for?
Jesus!

633
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:39,972
Know why I did that?

634
01:21:43,293 --> 01:21:44,851
It makes me feel good.

635
01:21:48,493 --> 01:21:49,448
Stop it.

636
01:21:49,733 --> 01:21:52,008
Rudy! Goddamn it!

637
01:21:56,093 --> 01:21:57,208
Have one yourself.

638
01:21:57,293 --> 01:21:58,442
You have one.

639
01:22:00,733 --> 01:22:03,122
-Have a bone, Harold.
-Have a French fry.

640
01:22:03,613 --> 01:22:05,205
Have a rib, Harold.

641
01:22:07,693 --> 01:22:08,887
Poor Harold.

642
01:22:17,973 --> 01:22:19,770
Those are good ribs.

643
01:22:24,413 --> 01:22:25,926
-Wait a minute.
-Have some French fries.

644
01:22:26,013 --> 01:22:27,287
Wait a minute!

645
01:22:28,173 --> 01:22:31,449
I don't like this game, anymore.

646
01:22:32,093 --> 01:22:33,048
Okay.

647
01:22:33,253 --> 01:22:34,527
You hear me?

648
01:22:34,853 --> 01:22:36,730
You! You!

649
01:22:36,853 --> 01:22:37,922
Okay.

650
01:22:56,173 --> 01:23:00,405
Authorities are reportedly on the lookout
for Doc McCoy and his wife, Carol.

651
01:23:00,813 --> 01:23:04,567
The couple is reported traveling
in a late-model, gray Mercury sedan.

652
01:23:04,733 --> 01:23:07,850
The pair is wanted for the recent
bank robbery in Beacon City, Texas...

653
01:23:07,933 --> 01:23:10,572
...which netted the thieves $750,000.

654
01:23:10,773 --> 01:23:13,003
In the course of the robbery,
two men were killed.

655
01:23:13,093 --> 01:23:15,129
The holdup money is still missing.

656
01:23:16,413 --> 01:23:17,607
Good evening.

657
01:23:20,253 --> 01:23:21,527
Two hamburgers.

658
01:23:22,533 --> 01:23:24,171
A milkshake and two coffees.

659
01:23:24,253 --> 01:23:26,369
-What kind of milkshake?
-Chocolate.

660
01:23:26,893 --> 01:23:28,645
-How about some fries?
-Why not?

661
01:23:28,733 --> 01:23:29,688
Okay.

662
01:24:00,773 --> 01:24:02,570
Roll it up part way, please.

663
01:24:50,653 --> 01:24:51,688
Bang.

664
01:24:58,333 --> 01:24:59,448
Shit!

665
01:25:08,973 --> 01:25:10,167
She made us.

666
01:25:20,573 --> 01:25:22,529
There's that goddamn gray Merc.

667
01:26:21,533 --> 01:26:22,648
Punch it!

668
01:26:22,733 --> 01:26:23,927
Punch it, baby!

669
01:29:34,013 --> 01:29:36,243
Help me shove these back.

670
01:30:08,573 --> 01:30:11,087
It's been ten minutes.
Come on out of there.

671
01:32:37,653 --> 01:32:38,722
You okay?

672
01:32:40,493 --> 01:32:42,245
I guess so. I don't know.

673
01:32:44,733 --> 01:32:46,564
WeII, it looks kind of deep.

674
01:32:48,773 --> 01:32:49,762
No scar.

675
01:32:57,813 --> 01:33:00,725
Don't scratch.
It's liabIe to give you an infection.

676
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:04,652
What did I tell you?

677
01:33:04,733 --> 01:33:06,086
It's not a game.

678
01:33:06,453 --> 01:33:07,806
It's all a game.

679
01:33:34,493 --> 01:33:36,688
-There's something I want--
-I don't want to hear it.

680
01:33:36,773 --> 01:33:39,367
Listen! It's hard enough for me as it is!

681
01:33:42,293 --> 01:33:44,170
The things you said before....

682
01:33:44,773 --> 01:33:46,172
You might be right.

683
01:33:48,453 --> 01:33:51,490
Ain't gonna mean anything
if we don't make it together.

684
01:33:51,773 --> 01:33:53,650
I don't think we can make it.

685
01:33:53,973 --> 01:33:57,124
I think if we ever get out of this dump,
I'll just split.

686
01:34:00,493 --> 01:34:02,051
We've made it together so far.

687
01:34:02,133 --> 01:34:05,330
We've come a lot of miles
but we're not close to anything.

688
01:34:05,773 --> 01:34:08,162
I always thought jails made people hard.

689
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:12,602
Not you, boy. I mean, you're just not
tough enough to forget about Beynon.

690
01:34:12,693 --> 01:34:16,481
I chose you, not him, you know that?
Not that it makes any difference.

691
01:34:38,973 --> 01:34:40,725
We pick up or we leave it.

692
01:34:41,333 --> 01:34:43,893
We leave it here, there's no other way.

693
01:35:10,093 --> 01:35:11,446
No more about him.

694
01:35:18,133 --> 01:35:19,612
Whatever happens...

695
01:35:21,453 --> 01:35:23,011
...no more about him.

696
01:36:10,813 --> 01:36:13,327
$8 a day, in advance. House rules.

697
01:36:14,093 --> 01:36:16,004
Checking-out time is 1:00 p.m.

698
01:36:19,253 --> 01:36:21,448
Oh, no. Would you please
carry my kitty for me?

699
01:36:21,533 --> 01:36:22,648
-Cat?
-Yeah.

700
01:36:22,813 --> 01:36:24,041
What's its name?

701
01:36:24,133 --> 01:36:25,282
Poor Little Harold.

702
01:36:25,373 --> 01:36:27,807
-That's a strange name for a pussy.
-Yeah.

703
01:36:31,613 --> 01:36:33,922
That's why it's kind of hard to figure.

704
01:36:34,693 --> 01:36:37,332
Don't hold for it. You gotta let 'em run.

705
01:36:37,733 --> 01:36:40,372
Dumb those goddamn horse trainers
try to rate them.

706
01:36:40,453 --> 01:36:42,125
Just breaks their heart.

707
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:44,249
All right to put the pussy on the bed?

708
01:36:44,333 --> 01:36:45,322
Yeah.

709
01:36:46,813 --> 01:36:48,804
The Lord loves a cheerful giver.

710
01:36:51,133 --> 01:36:52,771
Okay, now, "house ruIe."

711
01:36:53,453 --> 01:36:54,886
You got two choices.

712
01:36:54,973 --> 01:36:57,248
-You can live or you can die.
-Yes, sir.

713
01:36:58,733 --> 01:37:00,689
What...what do I have to do?

714
01:37:01,853 --> 01:37:03,411
You have to do what I tell you to do.

715
01:37:03,493 --> 01:37:04,528
Yes, sir.

716
01:37:05,653 --> 01:37:08,486
You do that and you not onIy get to live,
but you'll make a few dollars.

717
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:09,608
Yes, sir.

718
01:37:11,093 --> 01:37:13,209
Now, I'm expecting Doc McCoy.

719
01:37:14,173 --> 01:37:16,050
-You know Doc McCoy?
-Yes, sir.

720
01:37:16,213 --> 01:37:18,886
Then you're gonna let me know
the minute he gets here.

721
01:37:18,973 --> 01:37:20,088
Yes, sir.

722
01:37:28,413 --> 01:37:29,528
That's all.

723
01:37:58,053 --> 01:37:59,930
Rudy showed up with a broad.

724
01:38:03,733 --> 01:38:05,291
Laughlin's in El Paso.

725
01:38:05,893 --> 01:38:07,121
Rudy's there.

726
01:38:08,413 --> 01:38:09,846
Mexico...tonight.

727
01:38:10,693 --> 01:38:11,603
Two.

728
01:38:11,773 --> 01:38:13,684
Sure, Doc, I can do it for you.

729
01:38:14,733 --> 01:38:16,644
Just like old times, ain't it?

730
01:38:17,213 --> 01:38:18,168
Yeah.

731
01:38:18,973 --> 01:38:20,725
It's a nervous way to live.

732
01:38:59,053 --> 01:39:00,281
Hello, Jimmy.

733
01:39:00,853 --> 01:39:02,491
Oh, good to see you, Doc.

734
01:39:05,173 --> 01:39:07,733
-How's your family?
-Growing fast all the time.

735
01:39:07,813 --> 01:39:09,804
Well, I got it all here for you.

736
01:39:10,013 --> 01:39:11,605
Departure and arrival.

737
01:39:12,053 --> 01:39:13,532
All except the $500.

738
01:39:14,773 --> 01:39:16,491
-I get any calls?
-No, sir.

739
01:39:17,573 --> 01:39:19,962
My oId lady will be here
in about five minutes.

740
01:39:20,053 --> 01:39:22,248
I want you to get some food
and take it to the room.

741
01:39:22,333 --> 01:39:23,732
Just sandwiches?

742
01:39:23,933 --> 01:39:25,525
Yeah, that's all right.

743
01:39:26,493 --> 01:39:28,324
When she comes,
she'll have some luggage.

744
01:39:28,413 --> 01:39:30,165
Have that boy take it up to the room.

745
01:39:30,253 --> 01:39:32,005
WeII, he took the day off.

746
01:39:32,093 --> 01:39:33,128
Do it yourself.

747
01:39:33,213 --> 01:39:35,488
I can't, Doc. I can't leave the desk.

748
01:39:35,893 --> 01:39:38,168
You'll be in 318, Doc, till 11:00 p.m.

749
01:39:40,133 --> 01:39:42,806
Nobody else is on the floor.
You're by yourseIf.

750
01:39:42,893 --> 01:39:44,008
All right.

751
01:39:56,733 --> 01:39:57,961
Answer it.

752
01:40:02,813 --> 01:40:03,768
Hello?

753
01:40:06,653 --> 01:40:08,211
Doc McCoy just got in.

754
01:40:08,453 --> 01:40:09,852
318.

755
01:40:10,133 --> 01:40:11,168
Yes, sir.

756
01:40:17,213 --> 01:40:18,805
Get up and get dressed.

757
01:40:30,813 --> 01:40:31,882
318.

758
01:41:10,373 --> 01:41:11,601
Are you ready?

759
01:41:12,533 --> 01:41:14,330
What are you doing?

760
01:41:18,373 --> 01:41:20,250
-I'm coming in with you.
-No.

761
01:41:24,853 --> 01:41:26,366
Come on, honey.

762
01:41:31,733 --> 01:41:33,007
Come on, baby.

763
01:42:08,733 --> 01:42:10,246
What's the big hurry?

764
01:42:19,413 --> 01:42:20,562
I'm hurrying!

765
01:42:45,493 --> 01:42:46,642
Five fours.

766
01:42:57,893 --> 01:42:59,042
What's the matter?

767
01:42:59,133 --> 01:43:00,327
He's a juicer.

768
01:43:00,413 --> 01:43:03,086
His wife and kid are always with him
to keep him off the horses...

769
01:43:03,173 --> 01:43:04,891
...and to keep him off the sauce.

770
01:43:04,973 --> 01:43:05,962
So what?

771
01:43:06,333 --> 01:43:08,722
So they're not here. He sent them away.

772
01:43:09,133 --> 01:43:11,567
Get your ass in gear, baby, and let's go.

773
01:43:14,973 --> 01:43:16,406
-Move it.
-Okay.

774
01:43:31,173 --> 01:43:32,288
Who is it?

775
01:43:32,733 --> 01:43:35,611
It's your food, ma'am.
I brought up the sandwiches.

776
01:43:38,373 --> 01:43:39,328
Stall.

777
01:43:40,813 --> 01:43:44,123
Just leave them outside the door.
I'm not dressed right now.

778
01:43:46,333 --> 01:43:47,482
I can't do that, ma'am.

779
01:43:47,573 --> 01:43:51,930
You must pay now 'cause I have to pay
the boy that went out to get the food.

780
01:43:56,373 --> 01:43:57,362
Ma'am.

781
01:43:59,933 --> 01:44:03,687
Listen, you're just gonna have to wait
a minute. My husband's in the shower.

782
01:44:03,773 --> 01:44:04,842
Okay.

783
01:44:13,213 --> 01:44:15,727
He'll be right out. Just wait a second.

784
01:45:17,493 --> 01:45:19,211
Come on, it's me, open up.

785
01:45:41,373 --> 01:45:42,692
I don't remember.

786
01:45:42,773 --> 01:45:44,172
Listen, you old bastard...

787
01:45:44,253 --> 01:45:45,891
...tell me what I want to hear,
or I'm gonna rip...

788
01:45:45,973 --> 01:45:47,964
...these fingers clear up to your elbows.

789
01:45:48,053 --> 01:45:49,611
Are you gonna tell me?

790
01:45:49,893 --> 01:45:51,565
-McCoy's in....
-What room is he in?

791
01:45:51,653 --> 01:45:53,211
-He's in 318.
-What? 318.

792
01:45:53,293 --> 01:45:55,853
You better not be lying to me, you old fool.

793
01:46:46,093 --> 01:46:48,323
Down the hall, Max. Around the rear.

794
01:47:05,213 --> 01:47:06,328
Oh, my God.

795
01:47:13,053 --> 01:47:14,088
Rudy!

796
01:47:15,493 --> 01:47:17,051
Rudy!

797
01:47:23,133 --> 01:47:24,202
Rudy!

798
01:47:27,373 --> 01:47:28,442
Bang, bang.

799
01:47:35,293 --> 01:47:36,362
Rudy!

800
01:47:39,133 --> 01:47:40,805
Where's Rudy?

801
01:47:42,453 --> 01:47:44,887
Have you seen Rudy?

802
01:47:44,973 --> 01:47:47,362
No, I haven't seen Rudy, you dumb broad.

803
01:48:16,293 --> 01:48:18,249
Operator. Get me the police!

804
01:49:48,253 --> 01:49:49,925
Don't do it! Don't!

805
01:49:50,853 --> 01:49:53,162
Just run away. Just...now! Run away!

806
01:49:55,653 --> 01:49:57,564
-Drive!
-Sure thing, mister.

807
01:49:58,373 --> 01:50:00,329
-Get in there.
-Whatever you say.

808
01:50:00,413 --> 01:50:01,448
Want me to go, too?

809
01:50:01,533 --> 01:50:03,171
-Hey, are you hurt?
-No.

810
01:50:07,693 --> 01:50:09,012
Straight ahead.

811
01:50:11,773 --> 01:50:13,491
Hang in there, now, folks.

812
01:50:25,533 --> 01:50:26,886
Hey, how was that one?

813
01:50:26,973 --> 01:50:28,884
Oh, that was fine. Just fine.

814
01:50:30,053 --> 01:50:31,566
Where are we heading?

815
01:50:31,813 --> 01:50:33,451
We're going to Mexico.

816
01:50:41,293 --> 01:50:42,885
Can you find a nice, quiet place?

817
01:50:42,973 --> 01:50:44,292
Get us through?

818
01:50:44,733 --> 01:50:46,212
Why in the hell not?

819
01:50:46,493 --> 01:50:48,324
And don't hit any more cars.

820
01:50:51,853 --> 01:50:54,447
I don't reckon you're gonna shoot me,
are you?

821
01:50:56,533 --> 01:50:57,932
I kind of doubt it.

822
01:50:58,013 --> 01:50:59,241
Well, that's fine.

823
01:50:59,333 --> 01:51:01,528
Now don't you worry, I'll cooperate.

824
01:51:01,893 --> 01:51:04,612
Shoot, I've been in troubIe
with the law myseIf.

825
01:51:07,773 --> 01:51:09,809
Can I ask you a personal question?

826
01:51:11,813 --> 01:51:13,007
Sure.

827
01:51:14,293 --> 01:51:15,772
Are you kids married?

828
01:51:16,813 --> 01:51:17,768
Yeah.

829
01:51:18,213 --> 01:51:19,362
I'm glad.

830
01:51:20,253 --> 01:51:21,572
Damn, you know...

831
01:51:21,653 --> 01:51:23,883
...that's the problem
in this goddamned world.

832
01:51:23,973 --> 01:51:25,565
There ain't no morals.

833
01:51:26,893 --> 01:51:30,249
Kids figure if they ain't living together,
they ain't living.

834
01:51:47,653 --> 01:51:49,086
Buenas tardes.

835
01:51:49,253 --> 01:51:51,403
Chihuahua City. Building materials.

836
01:51:59,533 --> 01:52:00,602
Crazy.

837
01:52:07,213 --> 01:52:09,522
You know, if I was you kids, what I'd do?

838
01:52:09,613 --> 01:52:11,888
I'd quit this running around the country.

839
01:52:11,973 --> 01:52:14,123
You know, get a little bit
of money together...

840
01:52:14,213 --> 01:52:17,523
...and I'd buy a place and settle down,
and raise a family.

841
01:52:18,333 --> 01:52:20,642
I've been married for 35 years.

842
01:52:21,133 --> 01:52:23,772
Same old gal. Man, she's a tough old hide.

843
01:52:24,373 --> 01:52:26,807
Yeah, everything I am, I owe to her.

844
01:52:38,013 --> 01:52:38,968
Say....

845
01:52:40,093 --> 01:52:42,049
Pull over, over here, would you?

846
01:52:42,533 --> 01:52:44,125
Okay, whatever you say.

847
01:52:50,493 --> 01:52:51,528
Now what?

848
01:52:52,293 --> 01:52:53,885
Let's get out a spell.

849
01:53:24,653 --> 01:53:26,928
How much money did you make last year?

850
01:53:36,133 --> 01:53:38,044
I reckon about $5,000.

851
01:53:40,773 --> 01:53:43,606
Suppose I give you $10,000
for that truck of yours?

852
01:53:45,213 --> 01:53:46,441
You serious?

853
01:53:46,573 --> 01:53:47,562
I am.

854
01:53:49,853 --> 01:53:51,844
And I keep my mouth shut...

855
01:53:52,333 --> 01:53:54,927
...and I don't say nothing about the truck...

856
01:53:55,293 --> 01:53:58,091
...and I never seen neither one
of the two of you?

857
01:53:59,733 --> 01:54:01,212
That's what I want.

858
01:54:11,813 --> 01:54:13,212
How about $20,000?

859
01:54:14,413 --> 01:54:15,812
How about $30,000?

860
01:54:17,973 --> 01:54:20,043
Goddamn, ma'am, you got a deal.

861
01:54:22,533 --> 01:54:24,171
Pay the man, honey.

862
01:54:27,533 --> 01:54:28,488
Thank you, ma'am.

863
01:54:28,573 --> 01:54:30,768
Now, you'll have to walk
on back to the border.

864
01:54:30,853 --> 01:54:33,413
Oh, that's all right. Don't worry about me.

865
01:54:39,533 --> 01:54:41,888
I hope you find what you're looking for.

866
01:54:41,973 --> 01:54:43,725
Vaya con Dios.

867
01:54:43,973 --> 01:54:45,247
You too, ma'am.

868
01:54:49,853 --> 01:54:51,332
Take care, you hear?

869
01:54:53,573 --> 01:54:54,722
Goddamn it!

870
01:55:06,053 --> 01:55:07,281
Come on.

871
01:55:54,733 --> 01:55:57,725
