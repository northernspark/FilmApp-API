Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,240
Scared the living crap out of me.

3
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,280
Meryl Streep she wasn't.

4
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,000
Who's Meryl Streep?

5
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,960
Zoe, she's like Katie Holmes
to our parents.

6
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,520
So, what's next, ladies?

7
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,320
-I have to go home.
-No.

8
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,920
I can't have another fight with
my parents. They think I'm in bed.

9
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,320
Were you kids in bed early?

10
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,640
-I stayed up till 1 0.
-After 9, Rhett was asleep.

11
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,520
-Who's driving them?
-I will.

12
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,800
Nicki's selling coffee at school,
I'm helping her.

13
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,600
It sucks.

14
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Do not say "sucks," say "disappoints."

15
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,720
I don't need a lunch.
I'll go with Tash.

16
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,640
Eat pizza three days in a row?
I think not.

17
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,720
That's really good.

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,240
The proportions are perfect...

19
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,960
...but do you draw
what you really see?

20
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,640
The simplest is the hardest.
Seeing what's in front of you.

21
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,520
What's on for tonight?

22
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,920
I am so grounded. I got busted
sneaking back inside last night.

23
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,880
-Damn, how'd you manage that?
-My dad set the motion detector.

24
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,200
Our parents are getting
paranoid in their old age.

25
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,320
Mine still trust me.

26
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,320
It's beautiful.

27
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,560
Not a bad couple of decades.

28
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,280
Better than the first two
without you.

29
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,840
To 20 years of you and me.

30
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,760
And to our children, safe at home.

31
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,000
Hey, cool, you lost them!

32
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,120
Macho Mustang boys, to boot!

33
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,760
-We struck a blow for sisterhood!
-The only "blow" you know.

34
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,480
Diss.

35
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,680
-Any raves?
-Full Moon Underground.

36
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,600
San Bernardino.
Probably Saturday.

37
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll tell Mom I'm staying with you.

38
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,080
I can't believe you
still work that scam.

39
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,800
What can I say?
My 'rents are clueless.

40
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,600
I'll bring glowsticks if you buy gas.

41
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,440
-That's such a good idea!
-Nice try, Beams.

42
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,680
Rest, it'll be one hell of a weekend.

43
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,120
-Bye, Tasha.
-Don't let the bedbugs bite!

44
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,560
Hasta!

45
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,240
Now they call the cops on me.

46
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,840
Hello!

47
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,520
Hello!

48
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,600
I'm sorry I'm late.

49
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,840
Ruby Baker?

50
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,840
Yeah, I'm Ruby.

51
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,280
Whatever they said, I'm not missing.
I just went out.

52
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,560
Your parents were in a car accident.

53
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,840
Are they okay?

54
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,440
-Ruby, why don't you have a seat, hon?
-Are they okay?

55
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,000
My partner will help you have a seat.
Ruby.

56
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,040
-I can sit down myself.
-I know.

57
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,160
Are they okay?

58
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,280
-Relax.
-We're here to help you.

59
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,560
You'll be okay.

60
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,760
Relax. Ruby?

61
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,400
Ruby.

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You'll be okay.

63
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,800
-Get her pulse.
-Can you hear me, Ruby?

64
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,440
"They are as asleep.

65
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,880
In the morning, they're like grass
which groweth up.

66
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,960
In the morning, it flourisheth
and groweth up.

67
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,640
In the evening, it is cut down
and withereth...

68
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,320
...for we're consumed by thine anger
and by thy wrath we're troubled.

69
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,480
Thou has set our iniquities
before thee, our secret sins...

70
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,000
...in the light of thy countenance.

71
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,680
For all our days are
passed away in thy wrath.

72
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,600
We spend our years as
a tale that is told...

73
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,400
...so teach us to number our days...

74
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,240
...that we may apply
our hearts unto wisdom."

75
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,120
I think Rhett Baker wants to
say something. Rhett?

76
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,400
I just--

77
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,360
I just wanna say....

78
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
I just....

79
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,280
It's okay.

80
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,400
I didn't work with Dave and Grace
or see them every day...

81
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,960
...but I knew them for 1 0 years...

82
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,880
...and I'm sure if they
could hear this....

83
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,640
Well, Grace...

84
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,160
...would do her dismissive
little giggle.

85
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,560
You know the one.

86
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,760
And Dave would mutter
an "expletive deleted."

87
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,680
They'd hate to be remembered
as anything but...

88
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,280
...ordinary.

89
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,720
Which is exactly what they were:

90
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,400
Anything but ordinary.

91
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,600
But they will live on...

92
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,520
...through their children
and in all our hearts.

93
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,760
Ruby?

94
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,880
Do you remember me?

95
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,040
I'm Uncle Jack,
your mom's brother.

96
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,640
I'll go wait by the car, okay?

97
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,000
If there's anything that you need...

98
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,960
...anything I can do...

99
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,040
...l don't mean in the next few weeks
or months, I mean anytime.

100
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,640
How come I haven't seen you
in, like, 1 0 years?

101
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,240
Have you even met my brother Rhett?

102
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,680
Well, of course I have.

103
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,600
I haven't seen either of you in years.

104
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,360
First of all, I live pretty far away.
Chicago.

105
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,440
Then how will you help us?

106
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,520
I don't know.
There's the phone, e-mail.

107
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,920
-You and my mom never wrote.
-That's true.

108
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,240
As siblings get older,
they go separate ways.

109
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,120
-You and Rhett are close now--
-We're not.

110
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,480
We have nothing in common.

111
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,120
Used to feel that way about your mom.
It's not true.

112
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,760
I used to think I'd take a month off
and come out here...

113
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,160
...and get to know you,
your brother and Grace again.

114
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,760
Nice to see you.
Sorry things didn't work out.

115
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,800
-I'll call you later, okay?
-Okay.

116
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,000
Ruby? Hi.

117
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,160
-I'm Alvin Begleiter.
-Hi.

118
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,640
I'm so sorry.

119
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,840
I'm your--
I was your parents' estate lawyer.

120
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,280
I planned their wills...

121
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,320
...what they wanted to do
with their money and--

122
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,240
The most important issue right now
is who'll take care of you.

123
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,680
You and Rhett.

124
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,400
I'm assuming you know the Glasses?

125
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,280
I've known them my whole life.

126
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,120
Good. I know that your parents...

127
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,960
...chose them after a great deal
of consideration.

128
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,120
And there's something else.

129
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,520
Your parents were extremely thrifty...

130
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,640
...and with your mom's share,
your dad's life insurance...

131
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,000
...there's enough for you
and Rhett for the rest of your lives.

132
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,320
Obviously you don't know Rhett.

133
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,920
That's good.
I'll give you one of my cards.

134
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,240
I don't expect trouble.

135
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,240
But if you have any concerns,
any problems....

136
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,600
I'm an estate lawyer
and also a trust lawyer.

137
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,600
I want to be someone you can trust.

138
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,440
-You call me, okay?
-Okay.

139
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,640
Mr. Glass.

140
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,120
-Ruby.
-Thank you.

141
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,080
My mom and dad would've
loved that speech.

142
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,000
-They would've loved it.
-Come here.

143
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,600
That's good.
We're gonna get through this.

144
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,240
We'll get through it together, okay?

145
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,200
Oh, Ruby.

146
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,440
You're in good hands.

147
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,720
Hey!

148
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,400
-You guys ready for Malibu?
-It'll be a change, we won't lie.

149
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,200
It's not the worst place.

150
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,000
-Is this your car?
-My company's, on loan for today.

151
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,640
Sweet!

152
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,200
This place is huge!

153
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,720
Hey, Rubes, check out this view.

154
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,760
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

155
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,200
-Cool, a meteorite!
-It's art, Rhett.

156
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,600
Give them the tour.
Stall them, I'll order dinner.

157
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,000
Let's get the lay of the land.

158
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,040
Master suite.

159
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,600
Home gym.

160
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,400
-Home theater.
-Sweet.

161
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,400
-You never have to leave home.
-If only.

162
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,560
Vicki comes in most days.

163
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,360
-Hola, ninos.
-Hola.

164
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,640
Hello!

165
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,120
This is your room.

166
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,440
It's temporary quarters, of course.

167
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,040
Unpack, get settled,
and I'll meet you in the kitchen.

168
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,160
We're sharing a room?

169
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,320
Glance at me when I'm changing
and you're busted.

170
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,760
We have a little calamari,
a little risotto with mushrooms...

171
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,240
...and green salad with
some Swiss chard.

172
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,280
-Do you have any Garfield?
-What is that?

173
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,360
-It's crap in a can.
-If it's crap, how come you eat it?

174
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,080
-Come on, kids. Try the calamari.
-Isn't that squid?

175
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,560
-Honey, tonight....
-I'll call Domino's.

176
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,280
Thank you.

177
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,040
Can you turn and face the wall?

178
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,000
Who are you, the Blair Witch?

179
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,680
I'm worse. Just face the wall.

180
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,000
Turn that stupid thing off!

181
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,640
There's public school,
then there's public school.

182
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,680
Trust me, there won't be any
Bloods or Crips.

183
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,800
I'm not scared of getting gunned down.

184
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,440
-You're a great kid--
-It's not about being great.

185
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,280
-It's about being....
-New?

186
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,600
Middle-of-the-year new.

187
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,680
There's a saying we teach
the Pain Ward patients.

188
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,560
"This too shall pass."

189
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,920
This too shall pass.
This too shall pass.

190
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,240
Hi.

191
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,400
Why don't you take
a seat in the back?

192
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,000
We have a new addition.

193
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,200
Would you introduce yourself,
Miss Baker?

194
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,680
You just did.

195
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,320
Hi.

196
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm Ruby Baker.

197
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,240
I used to go to Shady Lane.
That's in the Valley.

198
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,160
Not my choice,
just an accident of birth.

199
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,640
How come you moved here?

200
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,280
It was another accident.

201
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,080
Let's make Ruby feel welcome.

202
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,560
Thanks for the lift.

203
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,360
Sweet!

204
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,520
I can't believe it!

205
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,400
Like one of those isn't noisy enough?

206
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,680
No, Rubes. You can't play
"Pokémon Snap" on PlayStation.

207
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,920
You can play "Ape Escape,"
but not on N-64.

208
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,600
Mom and Dad would freak out.

209
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,080
Don't talk about them.

210
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,200
I haven't seen one girl
with blue-black hair.

211
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,720
The guys surf and swim all day.
That sun-worshiping culture.

212
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,200
That sounds hot.

213
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,960
I checked my pager all day.
I figured you'd call and you didn't.

214
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,440
Cell phones are banned at school.
The kids don't care.

215
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,200
They can't see they
lost their liberties.

216
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,520
They have so much sunstroke,
they're wasted.

217
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,320
Ruby?

218
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,920
I got us an assortment
of different things.

219
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,000
Some cold pastas, some salads.

220
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,920
Ruby, I think that you'd be
well-served by a better attitude.

221
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,760
It's okay. I don't mind take-out.
You're busy.

222
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,600
It's not from Wendy's.

223
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,960
I meant your attitude
toward your new school.

224
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,360
-My attitude?
-I overheard your conversation.

225
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,920
You were listening in?

226
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,960
No, I was trying to get a line out,
but that's beside the point.

227
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,440
The point is, you need those
kids to like you.

228
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,480
Otherwise, you'll isolate,
sabotage yourself.

229
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,680
-You'll have a miserable time.
-Okay, I get it.

230
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,400
I learned something.

231
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,080
Ruby?

232
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,880
Ruby.

233
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,520
-Wake up.
-I'm awake.

234
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,880
-Wake up.
-Mommy?

235
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,480
Mommy?

236
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,640
You scared the crap out of me.

237
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,640
I heard noises. I thought
it was a burglar or coyote.

238
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,640
I'm not used to kids here.

239
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,520
Come here.

240
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,240
Thank you.

241
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,280
You must be freezing.

242
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,200
No more 3 a.m. swims. With all
the glass, you hear everything.

243
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,680
I'll set the alarm at night.

244
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,920
Are you coming?

245
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,120
Drunk driving among teens has...

246
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,400
...steadily decreased,
but we can do better.

247
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,440
As these images starkly attest...

248
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,880
...alcohol remains the No. 1
problem among teens.

249
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,240
This year, 20 percent
of teenage drivers....

250
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,280
How was your first day
of Driver's Ed?

251
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,840
-Fine, I guess.
-They still show gruesome movies?

252
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,800
Those were the Dark Ages.

253
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,360
They have better ways
of teaching kids today.

254
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,960
May I be excused?

255
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,280
Stupid, kid-proof piece of crap.

256
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,320
Ruby?

257
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,080
Was it awful?
I mean, the driving class?

258
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,280
-I can just imagine.
-No, it's....

259
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,280
I have my period.

260
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,000
Come with me.

261
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
Thank you.

262
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,000
Four doctors recommend....

263
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,440
This cramp, too, shall pass.

264
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,400
I'll turn it off
when I get to a save point.

265
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,600
It's cool. I don't care.

266
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,160
It's kind of relaxing.

267
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,360
Erin, get out of there!

268
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,200
What were you doing in there?
Tell me the truth!

269
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,440
-What are you implying?
-Tell me!

270
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,360
No, I won't answer you!
Good night!

271
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,320
-What the hell are you doing?
-Getting ready for bed.

272
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,320
-Watch your language.
-Don't play games with me.

273
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,760
You know what I'm talking about.

274
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,760
I'm too tired to guess.
I'm sick of your accusations.

275
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,840
Is that what you call it now?

276
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,600
-How many--
-I've done every--

277
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,960
You told me you--

278
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,400
Ruby?

279
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,840
-Hi, I'm Hannah.
-Hi.

280
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,240
There's this rumor you were
on academic probation.

281
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,160
Cut to the chase, huh?

282
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,000
I was. I had sex with the dean
and he took it off my record.

283
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,520
Oh, not really.

284
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,920
I was supposed to be at
my friend Tasha's...

285
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,240
...doing an essay,
and went to this rave.

286
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,680
Sunday I was fried and
downloaded this thing off the net.

287
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,120
-Tuesday, I was busted.
-Hey, Hannah!

288
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,880
-Hey! I gotta go.
-Bye.

289
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,600
Hey, Ruby.

290
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,080
My company's driving people
to a premiere.

291
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,960
I gotta make sure everything
runs smooth. Wanna come?

292
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,200
I have homework, three more hours.
Pretty heavy, so....

293
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,840
That's perfect.

294
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,640
Can we catch the end of the movie
or go to the party?

295
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,560
Actually, the hell with Westwood.

296
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,840
-My drivers can handle a premiere.
-Evening, sir.

297
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,120
Mud pie for the lady.
Ketel One, rocks, for me.

298
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,480
Great.

299
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,480
Thank you.

300
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,240
That party'd be a mob scene.
I really want to talk to you.

301
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,800
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

302
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,440
I remember when you guys moved
down the block 11 years ago.

303
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,920
It was funny. I noticed the furniture
as they brought it in.

304
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,280
Erin noticed a little girl.

305
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,280
But you were upset.
I guess about moving cross-country.

306
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,240
You wouldn't say a word.

307
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,640
Just hugged this plastic doll
against your chest.

308
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,320
Malibu Barbie, I think it was.
Prophetic, huh?

309
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,480
Think you mean "pathetic."

310
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,400
No, no.

311
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,200
-I guess you moved on years ago.
-From what?

312
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,440
From hugging plastic dolls.

313
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,120
I should hope so.

314
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,840
Last night, when you fought...

315
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,920
...it wasn't about us, right?

316
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,880
No. Married people sometimes
like to...

317
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,560
...push each other's buttons.

318
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,440
It's a form of intimacy,
a lower form, nothing serious.

319
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,720
One thing I haven't said about Erin:

320
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,480
It can be lonely living with her.

321
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,640
But that's my cross to bear,
not yours.

322
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,760
I think it's past my bedtime, Terry.

323
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,640
Of course it is.

324
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,880
Let's get you to bed.

325
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,600
Terry.

326
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,480
You're not wearing
your shoulder belt.

327
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,440
Hey.

328
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,640
Try not to make too much noise.
Rhett and Erin are asleep.

329
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,640
Okay?

330
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,800
Hamlet senses something's wrong...

331
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,040
...that he alone can set right.

332
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,240
I want two pages next Friday...

333
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,960
...about what he means
and whether he succeeds.

334
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,240
Mr. Begleiter, before my parents--

335
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,640
They ever speak about
guardians for Rhett and me?

336
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,560
Different from the Glasses? No.

337
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,560
-I think they wanted to.
-They discussed it with you?

338
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,560
No, but my parents weren't
friendly with them after they moved.

339
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,600
Ruby, the Glasses aren't your parents.

340
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,720
They'll never be your parents.

341
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,840
-If Erin or Terry has done anything--
-We sleep in one room.

342
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,240
That's not ideal.

343
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,960
The other night we were alone
in Terry's car. He--

344
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,280
What? What did he do?

345
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,680
He just put my seat belt on.

346
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,720
The way he leaned across me wasn't--
It just-- And I felt....

347
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,200
I know it sounds stupid.

348
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,880
And then...

349
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,440
...Erin was shooting up.
I saw her holding a needle.

350
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,160
Anyway, she looked really baked.

351
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,600
Ruby.

352
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,680
Ruby.

353
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,400
Try and understand this.

354
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,840
The accident, in effect...

355
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,960
...orphaned you and your brother.

356
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,800
So if this doesn't work out
with the Glasses...

357
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,360
...you've no place to go.

358
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,080
You'll become wards of the state.

359
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,360
I'm not trying to scare you.

360
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,240
I'm just telling you the facts of life.

361
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,600
I drove halfway here
with the housekeeper...

362
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,000
...and then hitchhiked
and I was scared.

363
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,040
But I told myself once I made it,
you'd help me and Rhett.

364
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,960
When we met, you said
I could trust you.

365
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,320
Okay.

366
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,560
All right.

367
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,840
I believe you. And I know
who to get in touch with.

368
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,680
It's not gonna be easy.
I can't promise you results.

369
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,760
But I promise you that I'll look
into this. You have my word on that.

370
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,960
Thank you.

371
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,280
When we spoke after the funeral...

372
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,440
...you had said that...

373
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,520
...we had more than enough.

374
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,520
How much would that be exactly?

375
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,160
That's a question for the
trust officer at the bank.

376
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,920
But between us,
four million dollars.

377
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,760
So you can see,
you're financially very secure.

378
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,120
Yeah.

379
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,360
Now why don't you go home.
And do me one more favor?

380
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,440
No hitchhiking.

381
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,440
-This is out, okay?
-Yes, sir.

382
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,440
Alvin Begleiter calling.

383
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,640
I just had a disturbing visit
from Ruby Baker.

384
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,440
Rhett, why don't you leave that now?

385
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,480
Go and do some homework.

386
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,480
I have a lot of homework too.

387
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,400
Stay a minute, would you?

388
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,760
What you saw last night
isn't what you think.

389
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,640
Erin suffers from diabetes.

390
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,960
I hid it.

391
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,240
I don't want you or Rhett to worry.
The disease is under control.

392
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,640
You saw Erin giving herself
her nightly insulin injection.

393
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,200
Must've been a shock to walk in on.

394
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,680
One more thing.

395
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,480
Terry tells me that you got a
little skittish with him last night.

396
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,000
That makes us feel sad.
We want you to trust us, Ruby.

397
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,840
We need your trust.

398
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,680
I overreacted, I'm sorry.

399
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,320
There're still things
I need to get used to.

400
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,600
We all do.

401
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,360
We're all under stress.

402
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,520
I'm gonna begin my Hamlet paper.

403
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,040
If you need help, let me know.

404
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,440
That'd be great.

405
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,120
That's fine. Put it in park
and step out.

406
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,560
And Ruby? You'll get behind
the wheel next.

407
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,520
You can apply a bit more gas.

408
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,960
Sorry, I'm a bad driver.

409
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,280
There aren't any bad,
just inexperienced.

410
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,880
Take a breath, start driving back.

411
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,800
Bye.

412
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
He's not in now.
I'll have him call you back.

413
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,400
He's not in now.
I'll have him call you back.

414
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,280
Hi.

415
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,760
-I'm Ruby Baker. Terry's--
-I know who you are.

416
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,040
Okay. Cool.

417
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,560
I came to catch a ride from Terry.

418
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,720
He's having a powwow with
some people now.

419
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,080
-If you wanna wait, there's a lounge.
-Okay, thanks.

420
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,680
-Glass Transit, may I help you?
-Any service technician to the office.

421
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,600
-What's going on, Terry?
-The usual.

422
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,600
Not to worry.
Nothing that can't be handled.

423
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,560
-We had a payment plan.
-The dates arrive, the money doesn't.

424
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,200
About that payment plan.
Nicole had a day...

425
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,120
...I'd call it unrealistic.

426
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,040
-You proposed that plan.
-I know.

427
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,120
-It's not dishonesty. We gotta--
-What is it?

428
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,520
Na"i"ve optimism.

429
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,360
But I'm an optimist by nature.

430
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,200
I'm betting on myself.

431
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
I'll be right there.

432
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,400
-Where's the money?
-You're not listening. The money--

433
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,640
-Say is, as in, "the money is."
-Yeah.

434
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,200
Can I help you?

435
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,520
-Whose car is this?
-Hell if I know. Showed up one day.

436
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,080
-One day, when?
-I don't know. Few months ago?

437
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:20,000
-We had a car like this.
-You really shouldn't be back here.

438
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,720
Ruby?

439
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,760
Ruby?

440
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,360
What happened was nothing.
Just a business glitch.

441
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,200
Hope you didn't get freaked.
People get weird about money.

442
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,520
I didn't mean to just show up.
I waited for Vicki and she never came.

443
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,240
We had to let her go.
Erin got held up at the hospital.

444
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,920
-Back up. You had to let Vicki go?
-We had to.

445
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,880
She drove you without permission.

446
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,400
Just to Santa Monica,
to the Promenade.

447
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,880
How did you know that she drove me?

448
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,600
How did we know? It's our job to know.

449
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,520
-Did you have a hard day at work?
-It was fine, thanks.

450
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,720
Hamlet.

451
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,880
Don't you hate how he can't
make up his mind?

452
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,320
To be, not be, not not be,
be, be not.

453
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,200
My father drove a Saab.

454
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,400
Terry!

455
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,320
Thank you.

456
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,920
For finishing my paper.

457
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,080
That would be wrong.

458
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,840
-Ruby.
-Yeah?

459
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,400
Come with me.

460
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,680
Sure.

461
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,160
Ruby Baker? I'm Nancy Ryan.

462
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,480
I'm an inspector with Social Services.

463
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Your lawyer said you
have problems with your guardians.

464
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:21,560
Please relax and be open.
Everything said here stays private.

465
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,200
Okay? So...

466
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,360
...you're 1 6...

467
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,880
...and your brother is 11 ,
and you share a bedroom?

468
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,600
Yeah, for now.

469
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,920
And you saw Erin Glass
injecting herself?

470
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,760
-They said she has diabetes.
-Diabetes? I'm gonna check that.

471
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,200
Now it's gonna be in writing twice.

472
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,800
My word still won't count
next to the Glasses.

473
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:58,360
Which is why I'll phone the Glasses
and ask them to meet me...

474
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,480
...so I can verify everything.

475
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,120
-Okay?
-But...

476
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,520
...how can I live with them?

477
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,000
-Do you wanna live with them?
-Sometimes things are fine.

478
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,960
Last night, Terry helped me
with something...

479
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,480
...but maybe that was
to keep me happy.

480
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,360
I know this is scary for you,
but don't worry.

481
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,560
We tell the guardians that we
perform a routine inspection.

482
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,120
If it's still in progress...

483
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,520
...you just act like we've
never met or spoken.

484
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,400
You have no idea why I'm there. Okay?

485
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,240
This is my husband, Terry Glass.

486
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,080
-Hello.
-Hello.

487
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:58,000
Is this necessary in the middle
of the day?

488
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,080
We'll get this done
as quickly as possible.

489
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,880
It's intrusive.
Let's get it over with.

490
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,040
-May l...?
-Of course.

491
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,200
Only one child sleeps here?

492
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,120
Yes, Rhett.

493
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,160
And the girl, Ruby,
she has her own room?

494
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,040
-Of course.
-She's 1 6.

495
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,560
Nice accommodations.

496
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,080
The kids are home.
Do you want to meet them?

497
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,280
Yes, I would. Just to say hi.

498
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,600
But first, Dr. Glass,
may I look upstairs?

499
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,160
This is awkward,
but it's also important.

500
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,680
It's a matter of safety,
so there's nothing...

501
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,960
...dangerous in easy reach.

502
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:43,520
-"Humulin L and U."
-Diabetes. I'm insulin-dependent.

503
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,960
We have it totally under control.

504
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,440
It would appear that you do.

505
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,440
Here's the two best kids in the world.

506
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,920
Hi, you must be Rhett. I'm Nancy Ryan.

507
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,520
Nice to meet you.

508
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,080
So Rhett, how do you spend
your evenings?

509
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,600
When I finish my homework, I read.

510
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:18,680
And you must be Ruby.
You have a very nice room.

511
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,080
You've made a wonderful home
for these children.

512
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,880
-Thank you, Dr. Glass.
-Thank you.

513
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,240
We'll see you out.

514
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,200
You read? You lie.

515
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,040
Guess who I learned from?

516
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,760
Bye now.

517
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,200
Why don't we order some dinner, hon?

518
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,760
How do you like your new room?

519
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,600
Couldn't have come at a better time.

520
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,360
Come on, Mr. Begleiter.

521
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,160
-Hello?
-Sorry to disturb you this late.

522
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,520
But I found myself wondering,
"Where's the money?"

523
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,200
You might as well know.

524
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,040
Six months ago I took on a partner.
A silent partner and...

525
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,160
...l recently found out
he was skimming cash.

526
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,240
You've lost me. What does
this have to do with our loan?

527
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,960
I'm waiting, Mr. Glass.

528
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,960
-Mr. Glass, you still there?
-Yeah.

529
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,960
He charged personal
expenses to the company.

530
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:38,320
When I want a heartbreaking
human interest story...

531
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,040
...I'll watch the news.

532
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,760
Meanwhile, your payment's due
tomorrow, close of business.

533
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,160
Do you fully understand me?

534
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,520
Mr. Glass?

535
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,400
I'm here.

536
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,200
I'm seeking full restitution
from my partner.

537
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,120
Plus I found a whole new
source of equity.

538
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,680
My big, new, personal piggy bank.

539
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,400
So you can expect another $30,000.

540
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:16,080
That barely covers interest.
You need to pay off the principal.

541
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:20,280
But I need some more time.
Not a lot more time.

542
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,600
A week at the most.

543
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:25,760
We'll give you two days,
because we like you.

544
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,600
We'd hate for you to find
your beautiful house burnt down...

545
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,160
...with your wife inside.

546
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,360
Yeah?

547
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:17,040
"I unfold a tale whose
word would harrow up thy soul...

548
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,200
...freeze thy young blood...

549
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,840
...make thy two eyes
start from their spheres...

550
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,800
...and each hair to stand an end.

551
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,040
If thou didst thy father love...

552
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:32,880
...revenge his foul and unnatural
murder. Murder most foul...

553
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:37,560
But this most foul,
strange, and unnatural...."

554
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,120
Begleiter and Brice.

555
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:48,520
-This is Ruby Baker for Mr. Begleiter.
-One moment.

556
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,080
-Did you get my e-mail?
-No, Terry trashed my account.

557
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,800
Or maybe the bill didn't get paid.

558
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,360
Did you find out about the BMW?

559
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,120
Right, the BMW.

560
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,320
It was registered
to a business: G.T.I.

561
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,680
Glass Transit Incorporated.

562
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,280
-Terry's company.
-Now don't you get it?

563
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,040
Ruby, please come with me.

564
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,520
I have to call you back later.
Bye-bye.

565
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,200
This is Miss Bassett,
our vice principal.

566
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,440
Ruby.

567
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:35,400
The paper you turned in to Mr. Kim,
that was your work, nobody helped?

568
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,560
-No.
-Not even Harold Bloom?

569
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,160
"Dance of contraries,"
didn't sound like a student.

570
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,680
I found it and other phrases
in Mr. Bloom's book:

571
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,520
Shakespeare:
The Invention of the Human.

572
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,320
We were told there's a case of
plagiarism on your school record.

573
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,960
You understand why we have to
take decisive action--

574
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,560
You were told?

575
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,280
-By who?
-That is hardly the issue here.

576
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,400
This sort of cheating
has to have real consequences.

577
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,600
We've spoken to your guardians.

578
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,720
Of course you have.

579
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,560
Frankly, we're not sure whether
you can continue at this school.

580
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,520
Well?

581
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,600
Why don't you ask Terry?

582
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:39,040
Or maybe it's time you took
some responsibility.

583
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,760
Maybe it's time.

584
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,000
This is Jack Avery.
I'm out of the country...

585
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,760
...but I'm checking my messages.

586
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,200
Wake up.

587
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,960
Don't make a sound.
Get dressed. We're gonna go.

588
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,240
-Where? With who?
-Away with me.

589
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:08,560
-Quit it! You're looking!
-Like there's something to see.

590
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:12,240
It's raining. I was sleeping.
I don't wanna go.

591
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,880
It'll be really fun.

592
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:20,400
They're giving away
Dragon Ball Z at Blockbuster.

593
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,400
We can go and avoid the rush.

594
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,720
Really?

595
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,160
Close the door.

596
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,160
What if they find out?

597
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,040
I'll take the blame.
Get in the car.

598
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,360
You don't know what you're doing.

599
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,600
Wanna slow down a little?

600
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:36,000
One thing I learned from Terry:
Buckle up.

601
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,600
-Terry's gonna kill you!
-Maybe so.

602
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,280
Turn that off.

603
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,040
Turn that shit off!

604
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,680
Look out!

605
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,920
You almost creamed that guy!

606
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,600
Right. Turn it off!

607
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,240
-I wanna go back.
-We're not.

608
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,320
-What do you mean?
-Figure it out.

609
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:52,320
We have to! You tricked me
and now I'm in trouble.

610
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,960
-The Glasses tricked you.
-What?

611
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,320
Did not. They're sleeping.

612
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:17,800
They were gonna send me away
and you'd stay home with them.

613
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,400
I like Terry. I like Erin.

614
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,920
You like the shit they buy you.
You couldn't see it.

615
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,360
They made you lie
to that social worker.

616
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,480
I didn't know she was
a social worker.

617
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,800
You didn't wanna lose
your Nintendo.

618
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,560
They bought you off.

619
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:41,400
-Where are you taking us?
-The point was to get away.

620
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,480
Crap.

621
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,200
Don't say anything stupid.

622
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,680
The highway is closed.

623
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,680
There's a mudslide.
You need to use Malibu Canyon....

624
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:19,200
-Can I see your driver's license?
-My license?

625
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,000
-And your registration too.
-It's....

626
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,400
It's over there in all my stuff.

627
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,160
I think I saw it over here.

628
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,520
Pull onto the shoulder and step out.

629
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,120
Officer!

630
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,000
These are my kids.

631
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,120
Terry Glass, Glass Transit.

632
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,840
-We loaned you limos for the parade.
-How are you?

633
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,080
Rhett, poor baby! Come with me.

634
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,280
We have a behavior problem
back at home.

635
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:08,200
Your sister's going through
a hard time right now.

636
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,720
-You know, teenage-girl stuff.
-Got you.

637
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:13,720
Good luck.

638
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,000
Move over.

639
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,400
-You can turn around here.
-Thanks.

640
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,640
Don't you have anything to say to me?

641
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:53,880
You killed my parents.

642
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,760
That's insane and hurtful.

643
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:03,360
You're threatened by your
business associates. I saw it.

644
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:06,600
Like Erin said to me,
"We need your trust."

645
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,440
You need my trust,
$4 million worth.

646
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:12,960
I got a business.
My wife's a successful doctor.

647
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,360
-I got a big, new--
-"Piggy bank."

648
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,920
That's just words out of context.

649
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:25,560
-What about the BMW my dad drove?
-What about it?!

650
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:31,960
For their anniversary,
I lent them a Beemer...

651
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,840
...so Dave wouldn't drive her
in that Saab...

652
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,440
...which I repainted.

653
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,400
No good deed goes unpunished.

654
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,960
In your trashy mind,
you twisted that into--

655
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,680
What do you think? Cut the steering,
stripped the brakes?

656
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,120
Yeah.

657
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,960
It's understandable,
basic psychology.

658
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,080
You don't wanna blame your dad.

659
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,880
That he had too much booze
that night.

660
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,480
Then you'd
ask why your mom and dad...

661
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:04,640
...hit the bottle.
Whose behavior drove them to drink?

662
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,480
Get this straight.

663
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,480
You and Rhett are mine.

664
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:46,440
I suggest you forget your lurid,
adolescent fantasies and start--

665
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,120
Help!

666
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,920
-Let me go, bastard!
-Calm down, little girl!

667
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,080
What's happening out there?

668
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,920
Your sister is having a tantrum.

669
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,120
Come on. Come back to bed.

670
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,440
Let me go! Get off!

671
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,040
Let go!

672
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:23,640
You...!

673
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,200
Listen hard, Ruby.

674
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,360
Anything happens to you,
we got Rhett...

675
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,640
...and all we need is one child.

676
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:42,600
Erin! Stop him, please!

677
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,000
Erin!

678
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:51,040
Please come help me, please!
He's not gonna hurt you!

679
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:55,680
Erin, please don't! Erin, don't! No!

680
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:03,920
Thank you for listening.

681
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:10,880
You'll feel better now, Ruby.
Rest, relax.

682
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,520
-Where to, ladies?
-The mall.

683
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,080
Time-out.
Has anyone heard from Ruby?

684
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:37,440
-Me? Not for a month.
-Same. Won't even answer my e-mails.

685
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:41,680
What up with Little Miss Malibu?
Too busy bodysurfing?

686
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,600
Then we are too busy for her.

687
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:56,760
-Hello?
-Where's the rest of our money?

688
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,800
The bank sent me a check
with the wrong zip code.

689
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:05,440
Some incompetent jerk at the bank
inverted the last digits!

690
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,680
So I'll need another--

691
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,040
We gotta expand the house,
a wing for the kids.

692
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:23,040
Our little boy gets bigger every day,
and the girl is a teen.

693
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,280
I don't know if you have kids....

694
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:32,600
Anyway, construction costs
in Malibu are off the charts.

695
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,240
I'm estimating a quarter million.

696
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:40,680
We'll need to see blueprints.
There's an approval process.

697
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,680
You can't get them
without an architect.

698
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:47,160
Mine wants a cash down payment.
He's in demand.

699
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:51,000
I believe we advanced you...

700
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:56,160
...$30,000 for that purpose
just last month.

701
01:11:56,440 --> 01:12:00,600
But that was for a room,
before I realized I needed a wing.

702
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:04,640
Isn't a guardian supposed to
keep the kids comfortable?

703
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,120
Here's the trust.

704
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,680
It authorizes me to use money
to enlarge the house.

705
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,480
And guardians aren't supposed
to suffer economically...

706
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:21,080
...in fulfilling their obligations?
I'm paying two tuitions.

707
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:26,120
I employ a nanny. The kids see
therapists to deal with the tragedy.

708
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,320
I plan trips to broaden
their horizons...

709
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:33,440
... and it's like a root canal
when I need reimbursement.

710
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:43,680
-Where'd you get it?
-You faxed it to us last week.

711
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:49,080
I'm surprised to hear you have
both children at Westcott.

712
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:56,440
Did I say Westcott? We changed our
minds about it. It's too glitzy.

713
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:02,400
-We gotta do what's best for them.
-Isn't that the truth?

714
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,040
Thank you for waiting.
I'll take your order.

715
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:09,640
I need five dozen
1 0cc syringes fentanyl...

716
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,280
...and I need two dozen
20cc syringes Demerol.

717
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:16,160
We sent up 60 of fentanyl on Monday.

718
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:20,520
I doubled the PCA infusion
rate of Demerol in six patients.

719
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,120
Dr. Glass?

720
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,920
I'm on the phone with the pharmacy.

721
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,160
Dr. Wise wants to see you.

722
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,360
The Medical Director.

723
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,400
Wake up, Ruby.

724
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:53,920
Sleeping Beauty.

725
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,720
All you do is sleep. It scares me.

726
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:15,200
So you're losing your medical license.
That's wonderful.

727
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:20,680
-I have a sickness.
-Yeah, it's called self-pity.

728
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:25,400
Complicated by being born
without a freaking backbone.

729
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,880
So I'm weak, am l?

730
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:29,880
Maybe I am.

731
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,640
At least I'm not greedy
and reckless...

732
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,360
...borrowing a million
from loan sharks--

733
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,760
Which should've been paid off!
We had a good thing going...

734
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,760
...till you put your hand in.

735
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:46,120
A good thing? You son of a bitch!

736
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:50,080
-I was a doctor!
-Yeah, but you became a junkie.

737
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:54,280
Not until you did what you did.

738
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,760
Where were you when I did it?

739
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:05,080
Right. I saw an opportunity, Erin.

740
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:08,120
I saw an opportunity and grabbed it.

741
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:12,480
I had what you didn't.
I had the nerve, the will.

742
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:15,800
Since nobody gave me
a chance, I took it.

743
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:18,240
I'm not doing this anymore.

744
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,280
It's already done.

745
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,320
This is about containing the damage.
Understand?

746
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,680
Good.

747
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,080
You know we have to
get rid of the girl.

748
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,440
Speaking of which, we're dry?

749
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:44,280
There's nothing to take care of her,
so I'll get something.

750
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:48,480
If I can't find drugs in L.A....

751
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,200
Hi!

752
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,600
Wave at the camera, Ruby.
Wave at the camera!

753
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,480
They can't catch me!

754
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,840
-Come in the water, Erin!
-Wait! I'm coming too!

755
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:48,200
Spin me, Erin! Faster!
-Good girl.

756
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,320
Rhett. Rhett, move away.

757
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:11,440
Erin! It took some doing...

758
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:14,680
...but I found some
pharmaceutical morphine.

759
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,680
Erin?

760
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,240
God, not now.

761
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:46,520
Erin?

762
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,360
Erin?

763
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,240
1 875 Montego Canyon.

764
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,240
I thought you'd wanna know.

765
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,560
Ruby?

766
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:12,920
Honey?

767
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:23,080
Terry needs to talk to you kids.

768
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:58,320
You kids are a handful,
you know that?

769
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:02,960
Where's your sister?
Where's your damn sister?

770
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,680
I should've put you here from day one.

771
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,760
What's happening?

772
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,640
He got the Jag.

773
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:54,440
-He walked back in the house.
-Keep working.

774
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,240
He's sleeping.

775
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:35,480
He fell asleep.
There's gonna be a change of plans.

776
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,320
Why would he do that?

777
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:40,800
He's bombed!

778
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,240
He finished a bottle of vodka.
It's right there.

779
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,200
I see what's weird.

780
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,160
Begleiter! What's going on?

781
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:14,280
You ought to have your
wife take a look at that.

782
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:18,560
-She's not home.
-Your office said you were home.

783
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:22,480
I kept calling but nobody answered,
so here I am.

784
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:27,760
The bank blocked your
guardianship account.

785
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,960
The officer believes
there's malfeasance.

786
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,160
The sons of bitches!

787
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,520
I went out on a limb for you.

788
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,640
I warned you about the girl's claims...

789
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:43,280
...about her accusations, because I
trusted you, as did the Bakers.

790
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,680
But if you've lied,
the courts will step in.

791
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:51,000
If they take these children,
they have no place to go.

792
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,160
He thought he was helping us.

793
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,200
Mr. Glass, where are the children?

794
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:17,440
At their music lessons.
Their piano lessons.

795
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:20,320
Next, I'll have to buy
them a Steinway...

796
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:24,440
...and the bank will say,
"Can't they play the kazoo?"

797
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:31,920
Shit!

798
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,280
That's my Testarossa.

799
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:40,320
No, that's our Testarossa.
Until we get our money back.

800
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,920
You planned to skip town today?

801
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,320
Where'd you get that idea?

802
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:49,160
-Your wife called us this morning.
-My wife?

803
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:56,680
Before you leave, how about repaying
the loan in one lump cash sum?

804
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,040
He doesn't have our money.

805
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,880
-What's going on, Terry?
-Ask him.

806
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:05,240
-Your partner?
-Bastard robbed me blind.

807
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,960
-Oh, my God. I'm leaving.
-No, no, no.

808
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:12,480
-You're not.
-Really?

809
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:15,320
-We need an explanation.
-From me?

810
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:17,320
I have nothing to do with this!

811
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:36,240
-Nobody listens anymore.
-Are you happy, Terry?

812
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,000
Feel good about that?
Terry, you're a troublemaker.

813
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:45,920
-That took care of the problem.
-No. We'll discuss this in the car.

814
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:47,880
There's nothing to discuss!

815
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:52,040
Just walk like a man out to the Jag.

816
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,680
That was the problem. You solved it.

817
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,760
The rest is pure profit.

818
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,480
Not the Jag. The Volvo.

819
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:04,760
Wait here for a minute, okay?

820
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:13,440
-Nice little drive in our car.
-No! Not in there!

821
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,760
Not in there! No! Not in there!

822
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,880
I don't even have the key!

823
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,480
We got all the keys to all the cars.

824
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,520
Take the Volvo, not the Jag!

825
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,800
-Let's go!
-Okay, you win!

826
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,360
-You win.
-It's over.

827
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,200
Just please take the Volvo, okay?

828
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,400
You're making this difficult.

829
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:36,600
-Whatever.
-Take the Volvo.

830
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,240
Brand loyalty. I like that.

831
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,600
That little bitch!

832
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:55,120
You're some kind of joker.
We'll take the Jaguar.

833
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:56,440
No!

834
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:56,120
You haven't been
to our Tarzana office.

835
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:59,120
We got a handball court and a sauna...

836
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:03,120
...and way in the back we have
this special room.

837
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:05,480
Totally soundproof.

838
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:20,960
What the--?

839
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,120
What the--?

840
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:21,840
What'd you do to this car?!
What'd you do to this car?!

841
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:10,000
Hi, you guys need some help?

842
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,080
Yes.

843
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:43,120
-Everything under control?
-We got it covered.

844
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,080
Terry.

845
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:09,480
You two kids stay in the car.

846
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:14,600
I have a possible T.C.
Southbound, Malibu Canyon.

847
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,840
-I'll be investigating.
-Copy that.

848
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,240
I have a rollover T.C...

849
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:06,960
...with one fatality.
I'll need two backup units.

850
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,160
Ruby.

851
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:27,600
It's okay.

852
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:30,960
Ruby, go! Drive!

853
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:36,840
-Where's the stupid key?!
-It's okay!

854
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:41,280
We're gonna die here! Let's go!
Come on, find them!

855
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:43,400
Ruby!

856
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,800
I need your help.

857
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:49,200
-He's getting closer!
-I got them!

858
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:51,480
He's getting closer!

859
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:55,200
Drive! Drive! Drive!

860
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,160
Why are you stopping?!

861
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:07,640
It's okay, honey.

862
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:10,920
-Buckle up.
-What're you doing?!

863
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:15,160
-All's forgiven.
-What're you doing?

864
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:02,040
You kids okay?
Go back and wait by my car.

865
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:47,520
Things will get easier from here on.

866
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:50,800
They already have.

867
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:54,440
Let's go home.

868
01:36:55,305 --> 01:37:01,664
