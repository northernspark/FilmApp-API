2
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,671
I was born 1911, Chickasaw County,
Piedmont Plantation.

3
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,132
And did you know,
as a girl growing up,

4
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,713
that one day you'd be a maid?

5
00:02:01,543 --> 00:02:03,170
Yes, ma'am, I did.

6
00:02:03,337 --> 00:02:04,839
And you knew that because...

7
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:09,515
My mama was a maid.
My grandmama was a house slave.

8
00:02:11,303 --> 00:02:14,681
House... slave.

9
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:18,814
Do you ever dream
of being something else?

10
00:02:24,148 --> 00:02:25,991
What does it feel like
to raise a white child

11
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,949
when your own child's at home being
looked after by somebody else?

12
00:02:31,405 --> 00:02:33,282
It feel...

13
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:48,055
I done raised 17 kids in my life.

14
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:51,514
Looking after white babies,
that's what I do.

15
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:54,599
Aibee, Aibee.

16
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:56,809
- Hi!
- Aibee!

17
00:02:56,972 --> 00:03:01,068
I know how to get them babies to sleep,
stop crying and go in the toilet bow/

18
00:03:01,226 --> 00:03:03,228
before their mamas even
get out of bed in the morning.

19
00:03:05,313 --> 00:03:06,860
Babies like fat.

20
00:03:07,023 --> 00:03:09,993
They like big fat legs, too.
That I know.

21
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:14,497
You is kind, you is smart...

22
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:16,909
...you is important.

23
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:19,544
- You is smart...
- Smart...

24
00:03:19,703 --> 00:03:22,252
...you is kind...
- ... you is kind...

25
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:25,258
...you is important.
- ... you is important.

26
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:27,844
That's so good.

27
00:03:30,213 --> 00:03:31,635
That's so good.

28
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:37,558
I work for the Leefolts
from eight to four; six days a week.

29
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,443
I make 95 cent an hour.
That comes to $182 every month.

30
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:50,033
I do all the cooking, cleaning, washing,
ironing and grocery shopping.

31
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:56,830
But mostly, I take care of Baby Girl.

32
00:03:58,157 --> 00:04:00,285
And, Lord, I worry she gonna be fat.

33
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:02,953
Mae Mobley.

34
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,248
Ain't going to be
no beauty queen either.

35
00:04:05,414 --> 00:04:09,044
Aibileen, bridge club is in an hour.
Did you finish the chicken salad?

36
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,211
- Yes.
- Oh, and Hilly's deviled eggs.

37
00:04:11,378 --> 00:04:13,051
- No paprika.
- Mm-hm.

38
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:17,017
Does this dress look homemade?

39
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:21,346
I reckon when you finish it won't.

40
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:23,936
Well, thank you.

41
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:28,103
Miss Leefolt still don't
pick Baby Girl up but once a day.

42
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:31,648
The birthing blues got hold
of Miss Leefolt pretty hard.

43
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:34,112
I done seen it happen plenty of times,

44
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,528
once babies start having
their own babies.

45
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,499
And the young
white ladies of Jackson...

46
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,294
...oh Lord, was they having babies.

47
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,258
But not Miss Skeeter.

48
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,255
No man and no babies.

49
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,291
- Morning.
- Hi.

50
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,551
- My name is Eugenia Phelan, and...
- Come on.

51
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,262
Eugenia Phelan, Mr. Blackly.

52
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,312
Shut the damn door.

53
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:53,944
I guarantee you, one day they're going
to figure out cigarettes will kill you.

54
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,481
OK, Miss Phelan,
let's see what you got.

55
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:02,737
Murrah High: editor.

56
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,782
Ole Miss Rebel Rouser. editor.

57
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,074
Double major.

58
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:09,251
Junior League: editor.

59
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:13,252
- Damn, girl, don't you have fun?
- Is that important?

60
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,716
- Do you have any references?
- Yes.

61
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,385
Right here.

62
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:24,344
This...

63
00:06:24,507 --> 00:06:26,225
This is a rejection letter.

64
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:28,933
Not exactly. See, Miss Stein thought...

65
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:30,768
Stein?

66
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,353
Elaine Stein, from Harper and Row
Publishing in New York.

67
00:06:33,516 --> 00:06:34,733
Oh, Lord.

68
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:36,611
I'm gonna be a serious writer,
Mr. Blackly.

69
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:40,319
I applied for a job,
but Mrs. Stein thought...

70
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:42,029
She said no.

71
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:44,115
Well, until I gain some experience.

72
00:06:44,277 --> 00:06:45,620
See? Says right there.

73
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:49,329
"Great potential. Gain some experience
and please apply again. "

74
00:06:51,493 --> 00:06:54,622
Oh, Christ. I guess you'll do.
Do you clean?

75
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:57,165
- I'm sorry. Clean?
- Clean.

76
00:06:57,332 --> 00:06:58,709
Grab that basket.

77
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:03,671
Miss Myrna has gone
shit-house crazy on us.

78
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:06,306
She drunk hairspray or something.

79
00:07:06,465 --> 00:07:08,718
I want you to read her past columns.

80
00:07:08,884 --> 00:07:11,558
Then read these letters and you
answer them just like she would.

81
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,143
Nobody is gonna know
the damn difference.

82
00:07:14,306 --> 00:07:16,308
You know who Miss Myrna is?

83
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:18,732
I read her articles all the time.

84
00:07:18,894 --> 00:07:22,194
Articles? Miss Phelan,
it's a cleaning advice column.

85
00:07:22,356 --> 00:07:25,155
Eight bucks a week.
Copy is due on Thursday.

86
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:27,991
Hello?

87
00:07:29,321 --> 00:07:32,996
Lou Ann, honey, I can't talk right now.
I'm at work.

88
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:36,537
What? Shut that goddamn door.

89
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:54,221
Mama, we're late for bridge!

90
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:56,936
Miss Hilly was the first
of the babies to have a baby.

91
00:07:57,098 --> 00:07:58,645
...Three...

92
00:07:58,808 --> 00:08:01,527
And it must have come out of her like
the 11th Commandment,

93
00:08:01,686 --> 00:08:03,939
'cause once Miss Hilly had a baby,

94
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:06,984
every girl at the bridge table
had to have one, too.

95
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:09,576
Minny, go get Mama!

96
00:08:15,616 --> 00:08:17,618
Missus Walters,
you need help coming down?

97
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:19,253
- I'm down.
- Ooh.

98
00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:21,789
- I been down.
- Give me a heart attack.

99
00:08:21,955 --> 00:08:25,084
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Missus Walters.
Here, let me help you.

100
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,220
Take that off.
It's 98 degrees out there.

101
00:08:28,378 --> 00:08:29,846
- Is it?
- Yes, ma'am.

102
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:31,678
Well, let's put my coat on then.

103
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,888
- Come on, Minny.
- All right.

104
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,518
- Here's your pocketbook.
- Thank you.

105
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:37,304
OK, let me get the pie.

106
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,939
Hold on, Missus Walters. Hold on.

107
00:08:41,975 --> 00:08:46,196
Once Missus Walters' arteries went hard,
Miss Hilly moved her into her house

108
00:08:46,354 --> 00:08:48,982
and fired the maid she had
to make room for Minny too.

109
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,120
See, Minny about the best cook
in Mississippi,

110
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:54,871
and Miss Hilly wanted her.

111
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,585
I lost my own boy, Treelore,
four years ago.

112
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,213
After that, I just didn't want
to live no more.

113
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:08,126
It took God and Minny
to get me through it.

114
00:09:09,126 --> 00:09:13,632
Minn y my best friend.
Old lady like me lucky to have her.

115
00:09:17,718 --> 00:09:22,770
After my boy died, a bitter seed
was planted inside of me.

116
00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:26,728
And I just didn't feel
so accepting any more.

117
00:09:40,324 --> 00:09:41,416
No.

118
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:44,919
You drunk up two glasses of grape juice.
I know you got to tee-tee.

119
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:46,000
No.

120
00:09:46,162 --> 00:09:48,460
I'll give you two cookies if you go.

121
00:09:52,502 --> 00:09:55,051
Mae Mobley, you're going!

122
00:09:55,588 --> 00:09:58,432
Aibileen, the girls are
pulling up, and the table isn't set.

123
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:01,094
Mae Mobley go, Mama.

124
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:03,434
Get in your room right now.

125
00:10:05,181 --> 00:10:07,183
Set out the dessert forks. Please.

126
00:10:10,895 --> 00:10:13,489
Put Mama in a chair
before she breaks a hip.

127
00:10:13,648 --> 00:10:15,742
I'm not deaf yet, Hilly.

128
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,198
Hey, girls.

129
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:23,868
Oh. Minny. Will you see if Aibileen
has some of that ambrosia?

130
00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:30,956
Hold on. Those are Miss Hilly's.

131
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:34,252
She looks like the winning
horse at the Kentucky Derby.

132
00:10:34,418 --> 00:10:36,420
All flowers and bows.

133
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:38,088
Got to have paprika on them.

134
00:10:38,255 --> 00:10:39,802
Ooh.

135
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:43,344
Forgive me, Lord, but I'm gonna have
to kill that woman, Aibileen.

136
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,389
Now she gone to putting pencil marks
on my toilet paper.

137
00:10:47,764 --> 00:10:49,266
- Did she?
- Mm-hm.

138
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:53,108
But I carry paper in from my own
damn house. That fool don't know.

139
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:58,117
Miss Leefolt got so much hairspray
on her head

140
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:00,494
she gonna blow us all up
if she light a cigarette.

141
00:11:01,403 --> 00:11:03,497
And you know she will!

142
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:12,337
- You got some ambrosia?
- You know I do.

143
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:14,043
All right, I'll be back.

144
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,174
Minny, cord, girl.

145
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:17,923
Shut up.

146
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:21,597
The Guiding Light.

147
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,511
Hi, Missus Walters.

148
00:11:27,094 --> 00:11:29,017
I'm watching my story.

149
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:30,936
OK.

150
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:32,850
Isn't it gorgeous?

151
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:34,018
Sorry I'm late.

152
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:38,318
You're home!

153
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:40,574
I missed you all, too.

154
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:46,202
Well, if it isn't "Long Haul" Skeeter.

155
00:11:46,364 --> 00:11:48,582
We didn't ever think
you'd leave Ole Miss.

156
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,084
Well, it does take four years, Jolene.

157
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:55,999
I've got a great summer planned for you.

158
00:11:56,164 --> 00:11:57,381
Great.

159
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,669
I went ahead and I picked up my black
dress from the cleaners this morning.

160
00:12:03,588 --> 00:12:04,589
What?

161
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,013
- About supper club tonight.
- What?

162
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:11,976
Honey, Stuart had to cancel.

163
00:12:12,138 --> 00:12:13,515
Again?

164
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:16,400
He got held up on the oil rig, Skeeter.

165
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,857
It's... It's offshore.

166
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:22,820
I'm starting to think this Stuart
is a figment of your imagination,

167
00:12:22,982 --> 00:12:24,234
so just forget it.

168
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:26,286
I'm just gonna go get a plate.

169
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:28,662
- Shh!
- Sorry!

170
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:36,962
I got a job today.

171
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:40,674
At The Jackson Journal.

172
00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:45,137
They'd be a fool not to hire you.

173
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:48,549
To Skeeter and her job.

174
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:50,467
Last stop till marriage.

175
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:51,847
Oh!

176
00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:58,101
- It's for the Miss Myrna column.
- Hmm.

177
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:00,361
Elizabeth, can I talk to Aibileen?

178
00:13:01,103 --> 00:13:04,277
Just to help me with some of the letters
till I get a knack for it.

179
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:07,201
My Aibileen?

180
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,532
Why can't you just
get Constantine to help?

181
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:18,210
Constantine quit us.

182
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:20,872
Oh, my gosh. Skeeter, I'm so sorry.

183
00:13:21,038 --> 00:13:25,293
Anyway, I just, um... I don't really
know how to answer these letters.

184
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,760
Well, I mean, as long as it doesn't
interfere with her work.

185
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:31,765
I don't see why not.

186
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:40,975
Leefolt residence.

187
00:13:41,142 --> 00:13:43,110
Hello. Is Elizabeth in?

188
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:45,738
She having bridge club right now.
May I take a message?

189
00:13:45,897 --> 00:13:49,776
Yes, please tell her Celia Foote
called again.

190
00:13:50,942 --> 00:13:52,660
I'll call back tomorrow.

191
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:54,867
- Yes, ma'am.
- Uh...

192
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,953
Miss?

193
00:13:57,115 --> 00:14:01,461
I'm looking for some help at my house.
Do you know any maids looking?

194
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,792
No, ma'am.

195
00:14:02,954 --> 00:14:05,457
OK. It's Celia Foote.

196
00:14:05,624 --> 00:14:09,299
Emerson-684.
Bye now.

197
00:14:15,258 --> 00:14:17,886
You scared the daylights out of me!

198
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,224
It is lunchtime,
and I am suddenly hungry.

199
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:27,646
Honestly!

200
00:14:32,983 --> 00:14:34,326
Oh.

201
00:14:34,485 --> 00:14:36,237
I'm still working on it, Aibileen.

202
00:14:39,823 --> 00:14:41,166
Who was that on the phone?

203
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:43,419
Miss Celia Foote called again.

204
00:14:44,745 --> 00:14:46,622
I've never called her back, Hilly.

205
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:50,422
She can't take a hint, can she?

206
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:52,177
Who's Celia Foote?

207
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:54,338
That tacky girl Johnny married.

208
00:14:54,505 --> 00:14:56,348
From Sugar Ditch.

209
00:14:56,507 --> 00:14:58,054
It could have been you, Hilly.

210
00:14:58,217 --> 00:15:03,565
And live 30 minutes outside of town?
No, thank you.

211
00:15:03,722 --> 00:15:08,649
Anyway, I ran into her at the beauty
parlor, and she had the nerve to ask

212
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:10,859
if she could help with
the Children's Benefit Ball.

213
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:14,194
Aren't we taking non-members?
The benefit has gotten so big.

214
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:17,452
Yes, but we're not telling her.

215
00:15:20,154 --> 00:15:21,747
Thank you, Aibileen.

216
00:15:27,203 --> 00:15:29,046
Hilly, I wish you'd just
go use the bathroom.

217
00:15:29,205 --> 00:15:30,707
I'm fine.

218
00:15:30,873 --> 00:15:32,625
Oh, she's just upset

219
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:35,545
because the nigra uses the guest bath
and so do we.

220
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:41,176
Aibileen, go check on Mae Mobley.

221
00:15:41,342 --> 00:15:42,434
Yes, ma'am.

222
00:15:43,636 --> 00:15:45,309
Just go use mine and Raleigh's.

223
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:49,146
If Aibileen uses the guest bath,
I'm sure she uses yours, too.

224
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:50,652
She does not.

225
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:54,780
Wouldn't you rather them
take their business outside?

226
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:59,026
Have you all seen the cover
of Life this week?

227
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:00,569
Jackie's never looked more regal.

228
00:16:00,736 --> 00:16:03,535
Tell Raleigh every penny he spends
on a colored's bathroom

229
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,541
he'll get back in spades
when y'all sell.

230
00:16:07,993 --> 00:16:12,089
it's just plain dangerous. They carry
different diseases than we do.

231
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,041
Pass.

232
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:17,336
That's why I've drafted
the Home Health Sanitation Initiative.

233
00:16:17,502 --> 00:16:18,799
The what?

234
00:16:18,962 --> 00:16:20,885
A disease-preventative bill

235
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:25,474
that requires every white home to have a
separate bathroom for the colored help.

236
00:16:26,345 --> 00:16:28,689
It's been endorsed
by the White Citizens' Council.

237
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:35,695
Maybe we should just build you
a bathroom outside, Hilly.

238
00:16:35,853 --> 00:16:39,357
You ought not to joke
about the colored situation.

239
00:16:40,691 --> 00:16:43,365
I'll do whatever it takes
to protect our children.

240
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,114
Your lead, Elizabeth.

241
00:16:58,876 --> 00:17:00,378
- Aibileen?
- Yes, ma'am.

242
00:17:02,546 --> 00:17:05,470
Do you think you'd be willing to help me
with those Miss Myrna letters?

243
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,054
Miss Myrna get it wrong a lot of times.
Be good to get it right.

244
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,312
Thank you, Aibileen.

245
00:17:16,726 --> 00:17:18,319
All that talk in there today...

246
00:17:19,729 --> 00:17:20,981
Hilly's talk?

247
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,613
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

248
00:17:32,826 --> 00:17:34,920
Is that Preacher Green's sermon?

249
00:17:35,078 --> 00:17:37,172
Yes, ma'am, it is.

250
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,254
That reminds me so much of my maid,
Constantine.

251
00:17:41,543 --> 00:17:44,922
I know Constantine.
We're in church circle together.

252
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,882
Have you seen her lately?

253
00:17:48,174 --> 00:17:49,471
No, ma'am.

254
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:51,181
Did you know that she had quit us?

255
00:17:51,344 --> 00:17:52,345
Quit?

256
00:17:52,512 --> 00:17:55,812
I got home from school a week ago,
and my mama told me she had quit.

257
00:17:55,973 --> 00:17:59,773
Back in March, she went to live with
her daughter, Rachel. In Chicago.

258
00:18:00,894 --> 00:18:02,942
Did you hear that?
Do you have her phone number?

259
00:18:03,105 --> 00:18:05,199
There you are, Skeeter.

260
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:09,695
Hilly wants you to put her initiative
in the League newsletter.

261
00:18:09,862 --> 00:18:10,863
OK.

262
00:18:12,448 --> 00:18:14,041
I'll be back tomorrow, Aibileen,

263
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:16,793
to get started on those
Miss Myrna letters.

264
00:18:16,952 --> 00:18:18,124
Y'all make it quick.

265
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:20,631
Tomorrow is silver-polishing day. OK?

266
00:18:39,682 --> 00:18:41,059
Hi, Jameso.

267
00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:42,477
How you, Miss Eugenia?

268
00:18:44,562 --> 00:18:45,563
Mama?

269
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:50,989
Mama.

270
00:18:51,611 --> 00:18:53,488
Yoo-hoo.

271
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:05,340
Mama?

272
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,717
Back here, honey!

273
00:19:11,923 --> 00:19:13,641
Is this a little too young?

274
00:19:14,425 --> 00:19:16,302
That's a little too everything.

275
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,392
Oh, hell. You're right.

276
00:19:35,111 --> 00:19:36,158
OK.

277
00:19:38,907 --> 00:19:40,250
Much better.

278
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:43,621
Your daddy bought me this dress in '58.

279
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:46,214
Mama, I want to ask you
about Constantine.

280
00:19:46,373 --> 00:19:49,092
Right after Ole Miss won the Sugar Bowl.
Come on. You try it on.

281
00:19:49,251 --> 00:19:50,377
What really happened?

282
00:19:50,544 --> 00:19:53,468
Skeeter, your mother is sick.
She wants to see you in this dress.

283
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,631
Unzip me.

284
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:57,346
Come on.

285
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:02,221
Did I tell you Fanny Peatrow
got engaged?

286
00:20:03,305 --> 00:20:05,103
After she got that teller job,

287
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:07,314
her mother said she was swimming
in proposals.

288
00:20:07,476 --> 00:20:09,353
Good for fair Fanny Peatrow.

289
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,774
Eugenia, your eggs are dying.
Would it kill you to go on a date?

290
00:20:13,524 --> 00:20:17,620
Just show a little gumption.
Careful now, careful.

291
00:20:17,778 --> 00:20:20,076
Oh, now look at this.

292
00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:23,993
This dress is just precious on you.

293
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,164
Just take it in a little here.
Little there.

294
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,294
- Get your hair fixed.
- I got a job today.

295
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,461
Where?

296
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:37,223
Writing for The Jackson Journal.

297
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:40,846
Great.

298
00:20:41,593 --> 00:20:43,766
You can write my obituary!

299
00:20:43,928 --> 00:20:48,058
"Charlotte Phelan, dead!
Her daughter, still single. "

300
00:20:48,224 --> 00:20:50,727
Mother, would it really be so bad
if I never met a husband?

301
00:20:50,894 --> 00:20:53,647
Skeeter! Skeeter!

302
00:20:54,689 --> 00:20:56,111
Skeeter!

303
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,197
I need to ask you something.

304
00:21:07,035 --> 00:21:10,960
I read the other day about how
some girls get unbalanced.

305
00:21:11,623 --> 00:21:12,966
They start thinking these...

306
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:16,635
...unnatural thoughts.

307
00:21:16,794 --> 00:21:18,137
Are you...

308
00:21:19,923 --> 00:21:24,723
Do you, uh... find men attractive?

309
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:30,103
Are you having unnatural thoughts
about girls or women?

310
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,942
Oh, my God.

311
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:37,777
Because this article says there's
a cure. A special root tea!

312
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:43,322
Mother, I want to be with girls as much
as you want to be with Jameso.

313
00:21:43,487 --> 00:21:45,660
- Eugenia!
- Unless, of course, you do!

314
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:47,199
Oh!

315
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:52,796
Carlton's bringing Rebecca to dinner.
Try to look presentable!

316
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,253
What the hell you know
about cleaning a house, Skeeter?

317
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:02,137
It's a start, Carlton.

318
00:22:02,296 --> 00:22:05,766
If you say so.
I thought you wanted to write books.

319
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:09,020
Now, y'all leave Sister alone.

320
00:22:09,178 --> 00:22:12,057
- I'm proud of you, sweetheart.
- The irony of it all.

321
00:22:12,223 --> 00:22:14,521
Giving advice on how to keep up a home
when she doesn't even...

322
00:22:14,684 --> 00:22:18,109
Oh, no, Pascagoula. You couldn't have
known this, but I'm allergic to almonds.

323
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,989
Sorry, Miss Eugenia,
I'll get you another one.

324
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:23,697
You know, last time I had an almond,
I stopped liking men.

325
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:25,406
Oh, my Lord.

326
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:29,324
Oh, no, Rebecca, it's fine. There's
a special root tea for that now.

327
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,833
You have pushed it, young lady.

328
00:22:31,534 --> 00:22:34,663
Daddy. What happened to Constantine?

329
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:37,127
Uh, well...

330
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:41,218
Constantine went to live in Chicago
with her family.

331
00:22:41,377 --> 00:22:43,879
People move on, Skeeter.

332
00:22:44,045 --> 00:22:46,423
But I do wish that she'd
stayed down here with us.

333
00:22:51,428 --> 00:22:53,146
I don't believe you.

334
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:57,354
She would've written and told me.

335
00:23:06,693 --> 00:23:08,320
Did you fire her?

336
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:13,117
We were just a job to her, honey.
With them, it's all about money.

337
00:23:13,283 --> 00:23:16,787
You'll understand that once you've
hired help of your own.

338
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:20,423
- She raised me.
- She did not!

339
00:23:20,582 --> 00:23:23,176
She worked here for 29 years!

340
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:25,552
It was a colored thing
and I put it behind me!

341
00:23:26,295 --> 00:23:30,095
Excuse me a moment, Rebecca. My daughter
has upset my cancerous ulcers.

342
00:24:16,844 --> 00:24:19,267
What you doing hiding out here, girl?

343
00:24:20,932 --> 00:24:24,311
I couldn't tell Mama I didn't
get asked to the dance.

344
00:24:24,477 --> 00:24:25,603
It's all right.

345
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:30,317
Some things we just got to
keep to ourselves, right?

346
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,243
All the boys say I'm ugly.

347
00:24:35,113 --> 00:24:39,209
Mama was third runner-up in
the Miss South Carolina pageant.

348
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:43,042
I wish you'd quit
feeling sorry for yourself.

349
00:24:43,204 --> 00:24:45,332
Now, that's ugly.

350
00:24:46,373 --> 00:24:49,923
Ugly is something that
goes up inside you.

351
00:24:50,085 --> 00:24:53,555
It's mean and hurtful, like them boys.

352
00:24:54,881 --> 00:24:56,679
Now you're not one of them, is you?

353
00:24:57,717 --> 00:24:59,640
I didn't think so, honey.

354
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:05,851
Every day...

355
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:10,652
Every day you're not
dead in the ground,

356
00:25:10,814 --> 00:25:15,411
when you wake up in the morning, you're
gonna have to make some decisions.

357
00:25:16,862 --> 00:25:19,285
Got to ask yourself this question:

358
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,583
"Am I gonna believe

359
00:25:21,741 --> 00:25:26,417
all them bad things them fools
say about me today?"

360
00:25:28,372 --> 00:25:29,464
You hear me?

361
00:25:29,623 --> 00:25:32,752
"Am I gonna believe all them bad things

362
00:25:32,918 --> 00:25:35,421
them fools say about me today'?"

363
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:39,425
All right?

364
00:25:42,595 --> 00:25:46,441
As for your mama,
she didn't pick her life.

365
00:25:47,892 --> 00:25:49,235
It picked her.

366
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:53,147
But you...

367
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,575
...you're gonna do
something big with yours.

368
00:26:00,696 --> 00:26:02,289
You wait and see.

369
00:26:04,658 --> 00:26:07,628
Come on, go home with me
till the dance over. Come on.

370
00:26:28,973 --> 00:26:31,943
Miss Stein, you said in your letter
to write about what disturbs me,

371
00:26:32,101 --> 00:26:33,398
particularly if it bothers no one else.

372
00:26:33,561 --> 00:26:34,562
Come on.

373
00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:36,527
And I understand that now.

374
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:39,113
Continue.

375
00:26:40,193 --> 00:26:42,912
I'd like to write something
from the point of view of the help.

376
00:26:44,447 --> 00:26:46,996
These colored women
raise white children,

377
00:26:47,158 --> 00:26:50,457
and in 20 years,
those children become the boss.

378
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:53,338
We love them and they love us,

379
00:26:53,497 --> 00:26:55,795
but they can't even use the toilets
in our houses.

380
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,551
Don't you find that ironic, Miss Stein?

381
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:58,710
I'm listening.

382
00:27:00,254 --> 00:27:02,848
Margaret Mitchell glorified
the mammy figure,

383
00:27:03,006 --> 00:27:04,679
who dedicates her whole life

384
00:27:04,841 --> 00:27:05,888
to a white family.

385
00:27:06,051 --> 00:27:09,430
But nobody ever asked Mammy
how she felt about it.

386
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:12,349
So, a side to this never before heard?

387
00:27:12,516 --> 00:27:14,439
Yes.

388
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:17,445
'Cause nobody ever really
talks about it down here.

389
00:27:20,274 --> 00:27:22,072
Skeeter, who are you
talking to in there?

390
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,453
Go away!

391
00:27:28,073 --> 00:27:31,042
- Who was that?
- My mother.

392
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,747
Look.

393
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:36,380
No maid in her right mind is ever gonna
tell you the truth.

394
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:40,089
That's a hell of a risk to take in
a place like Jackson, Mississippi.

395
00:27:40,251 --> 00:27:41,628
I already have a maid.

396
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:47,133
Really? A Negro maid has already agreed
to speak with you?

397
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,514
Yes, ma'am.

398
00:27:53,347 --> 00:27:56,351
Well... I guess I can read
what you come up with.

399
00:27:56,517 --> 00:27:58,690
The book biz could use
a little rattling.

400
00:27:58,853 --> 00:28:00,230
Thank you, Miss Stein.

401
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,148
Hey, hey, hey, all I'm saying

402
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:05,285
is that I'll let you know
if it's even worth pursuing.

403
00:28:05,443 --> 00:28:08,868
And for God's sake, you're
a 23-year-old educated woman.

404
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,203
Go get yourself an apartment.

405
00:28:15,535 --> 00:28:17,208
"Dear Miss Myrna:

406
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,837
When I'm chopping onions, how do I
keep tears out of my eyes?"

407
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:24,594
Shoot, that's easy. You tell
her hold a matchstick between her teeth.

408
00:28:26,046 --> 00:28:27,593
Is it lit?

409
00:28:27,756 --> 00:28:29,383
No, ma'am.

410
00:28:31,718 --> 00:28:34,767
Miss Leefolt said
you could start right away.

411
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:39,901
Build it just like the bathroom
at my house. Let's see.

412
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,690
- Right there. That will be nice.
- Yes, ma'am.

413
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,538
My goodness, we got to run back
to the car. Come on.

414
00:28:52,072 --> 00:28:53,448
Bye, Skeeter!

415
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:58,627
Aibileen.

416
00:28:58,786 --> 00:29:02,416
There's something else I want to
write about. I would need your help.

417
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:09,680
I want to interview you about
what it's like to work as a maid.

418
00:29:09,838 --> 00:29:13,138
I'd like to do a book of interviews
about working for white families.

419
00:29:13,967 --> 00:29:17,688
And we could show what it's like
to work for, say, Elizabeth?

420
00:29:17,846 --> 00:29:21,100
You know what Miss Leefolt do to me if
she knew I was telling stories on her?

421
00:29:21,266 --> 00:29:24,395
I was thinking that we wouldn't
have to tell her.

422
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:27,440
The other maids would have
to keep it a secret, too.

423
00:29:27,606 --> 00:29:28,949
Other maids?

424
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,779
I was hoping to get four or five.

425
00:29:34,654 --> 00:29:37,453
To show what it's really like
in Jackson.

426
00:29:40,576 --> 00:29:45,457
Show what y'all get paid,
and the babies and the bathrooms.

427
00:29:45,623 --> 00:29:46,840
The good and the bad.

428
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,378
I bought you this damn house.
I put up with your new clothes

429
00:29:50,545 --> 00:29:53,094
and trips to New Orleans,
but this takes the goddamn cake.

430
00:29:53,256 --> 00:29:54,473
Hilly spoke to the surgeon general,

431
00:29:54,632 --> 00:29:57,351
and she also said it'll add value
to our home.

432
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,354
I guess Mae Mobley can go to college
in that damn bathroom!

433
00:30:00,513 --> 00:30:01,765
Hilly's covering the cost and said

434
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:03,774
you could just do William's taxes
to pay her back.

435
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:05,981
We don't take orders
from the Holbrooks.

436
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,773
Skeeter, how you doing?

437
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:13,234
Fine.

438
00:30:17,696 --> 00:30:19,164
Fix me a sandwich, Aibileen.

439
00:30:22,492 --> 00:30:24,745
Aibileen, Mae Mobley's
crying her eyes out.

440
00:30:28,957 --> 00:30:30,584
Skeeter.

441
00:30:31,209 --> 00:30:34,088
I'm sorry, but I think it's best
if you leave now.

442
00:30:34,254 --> 00:30:36,052
Oh, sure, sure.

443
00:30:36,214 --> 00:30:39,969
And this Miss Myrna thing isn't going
to work out with Aibileen.

444
00:30:41,178 --> 00:30:42,896
I'm sorry.

445
00:30:53,482 --> 00:30:57,031
You're making it hotter,
flapping your arms like that, Minny.

446
00:31:06,327 --> 00:31:08,921
Look how big the waves are, Minny.

447
00:31:10,498 --> 00:31:13,752
Let's go to the beach.
Run, get Mr. Walters!

448
00:31:13,918 --> 00:31:15,636
He loves riding these waves!

449
00:31:15,794 --> 00:31:18,092
You know we went to Biloxi
on our honeymoon?

450
00:31:18,255 --> 00:31:19,723
Yes, ma'am.

451
00:31:20,633 --> 00:31:23,557
Are we in Biloxi, Minny?

452
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,724
No, ma'am. We ain't.

453
00:31:31,101 --> 00:31:35,072
Why don't you sit down here for a spell.

454
00:31:36,273 --> 00:31:41,028
And then me and you will go on down
to the beach in a little while.

455
00:31:41,194 --> 00:31:42,537
How about that?

456
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:56,421
Uh...

457
00:31:57,335 --> 00:31:58,336
Miss Hilly?

458
00:31:58,503 --> 00:32:00,096
Mm-hm?

459
00:32:02,632 --> 00:32:03,929
Never mind.

460
00:32:04,092 --> 00:32:06,971
You go on ahead and use
the inside bath, Minny, it's all right.

461
00:32:07,136 --> 00:32:10,060
Oh, for crying out loud,
it's just a little rain.

462
00:32:10,974 --> 00:32:13,773
She can go on up and get an umbrella
from William's study.

463
00:32:14,435 --> 00:32:18,189
I believe she was working for me
before you dragged us both here.

464
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:23,948
Daddy ruined you.

465
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:29,283
I'm just gonna get your tea.

466
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,486
Minny?

467
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:02,528
Minny, are you in there?

468
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:05,910
Yes, ma'am.

469
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:08,989
And just what are you doing?

470
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:18,544
Get off my toilet!

471
00:33:23,753 --> 00:33:26,347
You are fired, Minny Jackson!

472
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:39,893
Go on!

473
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:52,076
Eighteen people
died in Jackson that day.

474
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,333
Ten white and eight black.

475
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:03,792
God don't pay no mind to color once
He decide to set a tornado loose.

476
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,882
Aibee's here, honey.

477
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,592
Aibee's here.

478
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,575
Hurry, Aibileen! Mae Mobley
is up, and I'm off to the doctor!

479
00:34:38,492 --> 00:34:42,713
That's Aibee's bathroom, Mama.
Hey, Aibee!

480
00:34:42,871 --> 00:34:45,340
No, no, no, honey.
Promise me you won't go in there, OK?

481
00:34:45,499 --> 00:34:46,796
Yes, ma'am.

482
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:48,836
I'm right here, Baby Girl.

483
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,257
Isn't it so nice
to have your own, Aibileen?

484
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,550
Yes, ma'am.

485
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:13,576
You're my real mama, Aibee.

486
00:35:39,093 --> 00:35:41,437
- Is that Minny?
- Minny.

487
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,022
Hey, Aibileen!

488
00:35:44,723 --> 00:35:45,724
Hey, Minny!

489
00:35:45,891 --> 00:35:47,734
Mm-hmm.

490
00:35:47,893 --> 00:35:49,065
Where you headed?

491
00:35:50,437 --> 00:35:53,486
I got some business to tend to,
so y'all just mind your own.

492
00:35:54,649 --> 00:35:56,117
All right, then. Well, bye!

493
00:35:56,276 --> 00:35:58,074
Bye!

494
00:35:58,236 --> 00:36:00,910
Now is she mad at me 'cause I got
that job at Miss Hilly's?

495
00:36:01,072 --> 00:36:03,746
Don't worry about her.
She always mad about something.

496
00:36:05,786 --> 00:36:07,208
Aibileen.

497
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:12,793
Yes, ma'am. Everything OK?

498
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:15,087
Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you.

499
00:36:16,046 --> 00:36:18,299
You got some more
Miss Myrna questions for me?

500
00:36:18,465 --> 00:36:20,138
Oh, no, I just wanted to talk about...

501
00:36:24,011 --> 00:36:26,434
We never finished our conversation
at Elizabeth's.

502
00:36:26,597 --> 00:36:28,816
About that book I want to write?

503
00:36:43,697 --> 00:36:46,541
I'd really like
to interview you, Aibileen.

504
00:36:47,535 --> 00:36:48,832
I know it's scary.

505
00:36:53,165 --> 00:36:55,793
They set my cousin
Shinelle's car on fire,

506
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,008
just 'cause she went down
to the voting station.

507
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,423
A book like this has never
been written before.

508
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:02,262
'Cause there's a reason.

509
00:37:02,424 --> 00:37:05,267
I do this with you, I might as well
burn my own house down.

510
00:37:05,426 --> 00:37:06,723
I promise we'll be careful.

511
00:37:06,886 --> 00:37:09,355
This already ain't careful,
Miss Skeeter!

512
00:37:14,602 --> 00:37:17,321
You not knowing that is what's
scaring me the most.

513
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,574
Scare me more than Jim Crow.

514
00:37:22,443 --> 00:37:23,615
All right.

515
00:37:24,404 --> 00:37:26,031
Here's my phone number.

516
00:37:29,659 --> 00:37:32,959
- My car's here. I could take you home.
- No, ma'am.

517
00:37:44,507 --> 00:37:48,306
"No person shall
require any white female

518
00:37:48,468 --> 00:37:52,894
to nurse in wards or rooms
in which Negro men are placed.

519
00:37:54,892 --> 00:38:00,240
Books shall not be interchangeable
between the white and colored schools,

520
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,445
but shall continue to be used
by the race first using them.

521
00:38:07,779 --> 00:38:13,081
No colored barber shall serve as
a barber to white women or girls.

522
00:38:15,037 --> 00:38:17,381
Any person printing, publishing

00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:19,382
or circulating written matter

urging for public acceptance or social
equality between whites and Negroes

525
00:38:24,963 --> 00:38:27,090
is subject to imprisonment. "

526
00:38:28,299 --> 00:38:29,346
Hello?

527
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:32,682
Aibileen, I done went and did it now.

528
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:35,769
I went to Miss Hilly's house
this afternoon.

529
00:38:36,182 --> 00:38:37,434
Why Minny?

530
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,900
She done told every white woman
in town I'm a thief

531
00:38:41,062 --> 00:38:43,531
Said I stole a candelabra.

532
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:47,318
But I got her back.

533
00:38:47,485 --> 00:38:49,158
What you did?

534
00:38:50,488 --> 00:38:51,831
I can't tell you.

535
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:55,201
I ain't telling nobody.

536
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:03,426
I done something terrible awful
to that woman,

537
00:39:03,584 --> 00:39:06,178
and now she know what I done.

538
00:39:06,337 --> 00:39:07,634
Sorry.

539
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:12,926
Minny.

540
00:39:13,093 --> 00:39:15,095
She got what she deserved, Aibileen.

541
00:39:16,429 --> 00:39:19,057
But now I ain't gonna never get
no job again.

542
00:39:21,017 --> 00:39:23,315
Oh, Lord, Leroy gonna kill me.

543
00:39:29,526 --> 00:39:30,527
Leroy?

544
00:39:32,862 --> 00:39:34,614
What you done did now, Minny?

545
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:38,543
- Get off that phone, woman!
- Leroy, please!

546
00:39:38,702 --> 00:39:41,251
Minny? Minny!

547
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:43,632
Please! Please!

548
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:44,916
Come here!

549
00:39:53,215 --> 00:39:57,140
Please open your Bibles to Exodus.

550
00:39:57,803 --> 00:40:00,556
Chapter four, verse ten.

551
00:40:01,056 --> 00:40:05,607
God, having asked Moses
to free the Israelites...

552
00:40:07,396 --> 00:40:08,989
...Moses answered:

553
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:14,703
"Oh, my Lord. I am not eloquent.

554
00:40:15,571 --> 00:40:19,826
I am slow of speech and slow of tongue. "

555
00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:26,749
See, courage isn't just
about being brave.

556
00:40:26,915 --> 00:40:27,962
Amen!

557
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,343
Courage is daring to do what is right

558
00:40:30,585 --> 00:40:33,429
in spite of the weakness of our flesh.

559
00:40:33,588 --> 00:40:35,966
And God tells us,

560
00:40:36,674 --> 00:40:39,427
commands us, compels us,

561
00:40:39,594 --> 00:40:41,847
- to love. Amen?
- Amen.

562
00:40:44,348 --> 00:40:45,725
See, love,

563
00:40:45,892 --> 00:40:49,522
as exemplified
by our Lord Jesus Christ,

564
00:40:49,687 --> 00:40:53,533
is to be prepared to put yourself
in harm's way

565
00:40:53,691 --> 00:40:55,659
for your fellow man.

566
00:40:55,818 --> 00:40:58,116
And by your fellow man,
I mean your brother,

567
00:40:58,488 --> 00:41:03,119
your sister, your neighbor,
your friend and your enemy.

568
00:41:03,284 --> 00:41:07,289
If you can love your enemy,
you already have the victory.

569
00:41:07,455 --> 00:41:09,549
Let's stand. All right.

570
00:41:31,144 --> 00:41:32,441
Quick. Come quick.

571
00:41:32,604 --> 00:41:35,858
I parked way up on State Street and
caught a cab here, like you asked.

572
00:41:36,024 --> 00:41:37,526
Got dropped two streets over?

573
00:41:37,692 --> 00:41:39,160
Mm-hm.

574
00:41:53,249 --> 00:41:56,594
I know now that it's against the law,
what we're doing.

575
00:42:04,135 --> 00:42:05,933
I've never seen you
out of uniform before.

576
00:42:07,596 --> 00:42:09,394
You look really nice.

577
00:42:10,516 --> 00:42:11,733
Thank you.

578
00:42:30,035 --> 00:42:32,879
I ain't never had no white person
in my house before.

579
00:42:34,998 --> 00:42:36,500
Miss Skeeter...

580
00:42:39,252 --> 00:42:43,928
...what if you don't like what I
got to say... about white people?

581
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,268
This isn't about me.

582
00:42:48,928 --> 00:42:50,521
It doesn't matter how I feel.

583
00:42:58,897 --> 00:43:02,071
You gonna have to change my name.
Mine, Miss Leefolt's. Everybody.

584
00:43:03,568 --> 00:43:05,616
Do you have other maids
that are interested?

585
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:09,532
That gonna be hard.

586
00:43:09,699 --> 00:43:11,372
What about Minny?

587
00:43:11,534 --> 00:43:13,127
Minny got her some stories,
sure enough,

588
00:43:13,286 --> 00:43:17,131
but she ain't real keen on talking
to white peoples right now.

589
00:43:20,292 --> 00:43:22,886
What does it feel like
to raise a white child

590
00:43:23,045 --> 00:43:25,924
when your own child's at home being
looked after by somebody else?

591
00:43:28,759 --> 00:43:30,306
It feel...

592
00:43:42,689 --> 00:43:43,906
Is that your son?

593
00:43:49,071 --> 00:43:50,948
Yes, ma'am.

594
00:43:51,114 --> 00:43:53,287
Can we move on to the next question?

595
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:56,328
You don't have to call me ma'am.

596
00:43:56,911 --> 00:43:58,913
Not here.

597
00:44:04,877 --> 00:44:05,924
Uh...

598
00:44:06,087 --> 00:44:08,510
Do you want to talk about the bathroom?

599
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,310
Or anything about Miss Leefolt?

600
00:44:13,302 --> 00:44:17,933
How she pays you, or has she ever
yelled at you in front of Mae Mobley?

601
00:44:22,353 --> 00:44:25,698
I thought I might write my stories down
and read them to you.

602
00:44:26,399 --> 00:44:28,493
Ain't no different than writing down
my prayers.

603
00:44:32,446 --> 00:44:33,868
OK.

604
00:44:35,408 --> 00:44:36,454
Sure.

605
00:44:43,832 --> 00:44:46,301
I don't say my prayers out loud.

606
00:44:46,459 --> 00:44:49,633
I can get my point across
a lot better writing them down.

607
00:44:49,796 --> 00:44:54,848
I write an hour,
sometimes two, every night.

608
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:59,686
And after my prayers last night,
I got some stories down, too.

609
00:45:02,976 --> 00:45:04,273
Go ahead.

610
00:45:13,903 --> 00:45:16,998
"My first white baby to ever look after

611
00:45:17,157 --> 00:45:20,376
was named Alton Carrington Speers.

612
00:45:20,534 --> 00:45:24,584
It was 1925, and I had just turned 14.

613
00:45:25,247 --> 00:45:28,296
I dropped out of school
to help Mama with the bills.

614
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:31,053
Alton's mama died of lung disease. "

615
00:45:34,673 --> 00:45:38,598
I loved that baby. And he loved me.

616
00:45:41,055 --> 00:45:44,150
That's when I learned I could make
children feel proud of theyself.

617
00:45:46,852 --> 00:45:50,322
Alton used to always be asking me
how come I was black.

618
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,529
Just ate him up.

619
00:45:52,691 --> 00:45:56,571
And one time, I told him it was because
I drank too much coffee.

620
00:46:00,823 --> 00:46:03,451
You should have seen his face.

621
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:18,432
This was just so great.

622
00:46:20,426 --> 00:46:23,726
I can't tell you how much I appreciate
your doing this with me.

623
00:46:24,972 --> 00:46:26,690
What changed your mind?

624
00:46:28,393 --> 00:46:29,519
God.

625
00:46:31,687 --> 00:46:33,655
And Miss Hilly Holbrook.

626
00:46:46,868 --> 00:46:51,544
Miss Hilly, I would like to ask you
and Mr. William something.

627
00:46:55,001 --> 00:46:59,051
My twin boys graduated from high school,
both on the honor roll.

628
00:46:59,714 --> 00:47:03,184
Me and my husband, we been saving
for years to send them to Tougaloo.

629
00:47:05,178 --> 00:47:08,307
We're short about $75
on one of the tuitions.

630
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:15,322
Whoo! I am late. I gotta get going.

631
00:47:18,275 --> 00:47:19,492
See you tonight, honey.

632
00:47:19,651 --> 00:47:20,697
OK.

633
00:47:23,112 --> 00:47:24,238
Go on.

634
00:47:27,741 --> 00:47:30,620
Well, now we're...

635
00:47:30,786 --> 00:47:33,505
...faced with having to choose

636
00:47:33,664 --> 00:47:36,292
which son can go if we don't
come up with the money.

637
00:47:37,501 --> 00:47:40,129
Would you consider giving us a loan?

638
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,102
I'd work every day for free
till it was paid off.

639
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:50,265
That's not working for free.
That's paying off a debt.

640
00:47:52,766 --> 00:47:54,268
Yes, ma'am.

641
00:47:58,189 --> 00:48:02,443
As a Christian, I'm doing you a favor.

642
00:48:04,194 --> 00:48:08,415
See, God don't give charity to those
who are well and able.

643
00:48:09,574 --> 00:48:13,374
You need to come up with this money
on your own. OK?

644
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,628
Yes, ma'am.

645
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:19,258
You'll thank me one day.

646
00:48:21,794 --> 00:48:25,139
You cooking white food,
you taste it with a different spoon.

647
00:48:25,882 --> 00:48:28,010
If they see you put the tasting spoon
back in the pot,

648
00:48:28,176 --> 00:48:29,519
might as well throw it all out.

649
00:48:29,677 --> 00:48:30,849
Spoon, too.

650
00:48:31,012 --> 00:48:34,232
And you use the same cup, same fork,
same plate every day.

651
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:35,983
And you put it up in the cabinet.

652
00:48:36,142 --> 00:48:38,861
You tell that white woman that's where
you're gonna keep it from now on out.

653
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,818
Don't do it and see what happens.

654
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,652
Morning, ladies.

655
00:48:42,814 --> 00:48:44,487
When you're sewing white folks coffee,

656
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:45,947
set it down in front of them.

657
00:48:46,109 --> 00:48:48,783
Don't hand it to them,
'cause your hands can't touch.

658
00:48:49,571 --> 00:48:52,290
And don't hit on they children.

659
00:48:52,449 --> 00:48:54,998
White folks like to do
they own spanking.

660
00:48:56,286 --> 00:48:58,789
And last thing. Come here.

661
00:49:00,082 --> 00:49:01,299
Look at me.

662
00:49:01,458 --> 00:49:03,802
No Sass-mouthing.

663
00:49:05,921 --> 00:49:08,299
No Sass-mouthing.

664
00:49:08,465 --> 00:49:10,183
I mean it.

665
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:16,732
Give your mama a kiss.

666
00:49:19,393 --> 00:49:23,898
Leroy had made Sugar quit
school to help him with the bills.

667
00:49:27,775 --> 00:49:31,200
And every day Minny
went without a job,

668
00:49:31,362 --> 00:49:34,115
might have been a day Leroy
took her from our world.

669
00:49:38,578 --> 00:49:40,330
Good morning, everybody.

670
00:49:47,211 --> 00:49:48,508
But I knew.

671
00:49:48,671 --> 00:49:52,972
I knew the only white lady Miss Hilly
hadn't gotten to with her lies.

672
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:03,068
Hey!

673
00:50:03,227 --> 00:50:06,275
Come on!

674
00:50:06,438 --> 00:50:10,909
No sass-mouthing, Minny Jackson.
No Sass-mouthing.

675
00:50:12,819 --> 00:50:15,447
Aibileen said you'd be on time.

676
00:50:19,701 --> 00:50:21,578
I'm Celia Rae Foote.

677
00:50:21,745 --> 00:50:23,418
I'm Minny Jackson.

678
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,089
You, uh... cooking something?

679
00:50:29,294 --> 00:50:32,719
One of those upside-down cakes
from a magazine.

680
00:50:32,881 --> 00:50:36,636
It ain't working out too good.
Come on, let's get you a cold Coca-Cola.

681
00:50:39,346 --> 00:50:40,347
Come on.

682
00:50:42,474 --> 00:50:44,522
This here is the kitchen.

683
00:50:45,768 --> 00:50:48,066
What in the hell?

684
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,863
I guess I got some learning to do.

685
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:57,659
You sure do.

686
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:00,870
Johnny's grandmama left him this house
when she died.

687
00:51:01,033 --> 00:51:04,037
And then Johnny's mama
wouldn't let me change a thing.

688
00:51:04,203 --> 00:51:06,205
But if I had it my way,

689
00:51:06,372 --> 00:51:11,253
this place would be wall-to-wall
white carpet with gold trim.

690
00:51:11,418 --> 00:51:13,591
None of this old stuff.

691
00:51:13,754 --> 00:51:16,052
The main house has
five beds and baths,

692
00:51:16,215 --> 00:51:20,516
and then the pool house has
two more beds and baths.

693
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:22,851
When y'all gonna start
having some children,

694
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:25,107
filling up all these empty beds?

695
00:51:27,266 --> 00:51:29,894
- I'm pregnant now.
- Oh.

696
00:51:30,061 --> 00:51:33,565
Gonna be eating for two.
That's double the cooking.

697
00:51:34,607 --> 00:51:37,486
I know. It's an awful lotto do.

698
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:41,623
Five other maids have
already turned me down.

699
00:51:42,615 --> 00:51:45,243
Let me at least get you some bus money.

700
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:48,835
Now, uh... when did you hear me say
I don't want to clean this house?

701
00:51:50,081 --> 00:51:53,335
Wait. So you'll do it?

702
00:51:59,882 --> 00:52:01,600
Ooh. No hugging. No hugging.

703
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,106
I'm sorry. This is the first time
I've hired a maid.

704
00:52:08,014 --> 00:52:09,561
Come on.

705
00:52:15,814 --> 00:52:19,284
- You hungry?
- No, ma'am. Hold on a minute.

706
00:52:19,443 --> 00:52:21,491
We gots to talk about
some things first.

707
00:52:23,655 --> 00:52:25,532
Oh.

708
00:52:25,699 --> 00:52:27,326
I work Sunday through Friday.

709
00:52:27,492 --> 00:52:30,496
No, you can't work at all
on the weekends.

710
00:52:30,662 --> 00:52:34,041
OK. What time you want me here?

711
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:39,054
After 9:00, and you gotta leave
before 4:00.

712
00:52:40,213 --> 00:52:41,385
OK.

713
00:52:41,548 --> 00:52:43,266
Now...

714
00:52:43,425 --> 00:52:45,018
What your husband say you can pay?

715
00:52:46,678 --> 00:52:48,771
Johnny doesn't know
I'm bringing in help.

716
00:52:48,929 --> 00:52:51,023
And what Mr. Johnny gonna do
when he come home

717
00:52:51,182 --> 00:52:53,355
and find a colored woman in his house?

718
00:52:53,517 --> 00:52:56,316
It's not like I'd be fibbing.

719
00:52:56,479 --> 00:52:58,902
I just want him to think I can do this
on my own.

720
00:53:00,983 --> 00:53:03,361
I really need a maid.

721
00:53:05,362 --> 00:53:07,740
I'll be here tomorrow morning
about 9:15.

722
00:53:09,867 --> 00:53:10,993
Great.

723
00:53:14,205 --> 00:53:16,674
- Miss Celia?
- Hmm?

724
00:53:17,249 --> 00:53:19,126
I think you done burned up your cake.

725
00:53:22,213 --> 00:53:23,556
Doggone it!

726
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:31,972
OK, let's see.
What's first up on the agenda?

727
00:53:33,097 --> 00:53:38,274
We are running behind on our coat drive.
Hurry up and clean out those closets.

728
00:53:38,436 --> 00:53:43,488
But our Christmas benefit, however,
is right on schedule. Mary Beth?

729
00:53:44,692 --> 00:53:49,414
Well, thanks to y'all, I can announce
that we already filled

730
00:53:49,572 --> 00:53:52,621
every raffle slot for baked goods!

731
00:53:55,036 --> 00:53:58,540
Think we can put a dent in
African children's hunger this year?

732
00:53:59,624 --> 00:54:01,718
A big dent!

733
00:54:05,004 --> 00:54:06,005
Now...

734
00:54:06,172 --> 00:54:08,800
...I just found out
the surgeon general

735
00:54:08,967 --> 00:54:12,345
has reviewed the Home Health
Sanitation Initiative that I drafted,

736
00:54:12,511 --> 00:54:16,516
and he passed it along
to Governor Barnett!

737
00:54:17,266 --> 00:54:20,691
Skeeter, when can we expect to see
the initiative in the newsletter?

738
00:54:20,853 --> 00:54:22,526
I gave it to you a month ago.

739
00:54:22,688 --> 00:54:24,611
I gave that to you myself.

740
00:54:24,773 --> 00:54:27,743
Would you please stand, Skeeter?

741
00:54:32,614 --> 00:54:34,537
I'll have it in there real soon.

742
00:54:37,536 --> 00:54:38,788
Great.

743
00:54:47,129 --> 00:54:49,507
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

744
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:58,431
Thanks.

745
00:55:03,477 --> 00:55:06,697
Hilly, I really am sorry
about the newsletter.

746
00:55:06,856 --> 00:55:09,154
It's just with Mama being sick and all.

747
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:12,828
Oh, it's fine.

748
00:55:15,197 --> 00:55:17,541
I made you the egg and olive on rye,
Miss Skeeter.

749
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,078
Oh, thank you, Henry.

750
00:55:20,244 --> 00:55:21,746
You remembered.

751
00:55:21,913 --> 00:55:23,256
You're welcome.

752
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,752
Oh, Hilly, tell her.
I can hardly stand it.

753
00:55:28,628 --> 00:55:31,222
He's coming.

754
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,804
Oh, Skeeter, Stuart's definitely
coming this time. Next Saturday week.

755
00:55:34,966 --> 00:55:39,722
Well, he's canceled twice before.
Don't you think maybe that's a sign?

756
00:55:39,888 --> 00:55:42,232
Don't you dare say that.

757
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:44,142
You know I'm not gonna be his type.

758
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:46,528
Damn it, Skeeter, I'm not gonna
let you miss out on this

759
00:55:46,686 --> 00:55:49,906
because your mother convinced you you're
not good enough for somebody like him.

760
00:55:53,944 --> 00:55:55,787
Saturday night.

761
00:56:33,941 --> 00:56:36,615
Good morning.

762
00:56:36,777 --> 00:56:39,701
Good morning, Baby Girl.

763
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:42,161
Good morning.

764
00:56:54,628 --> 00:56:56,925
I reckon I'm ready to talk about
Miss Leefolt now.

765
00:57:00,008 --> 00:57:03,182
Baby Girl still gotta wear a diaper
when she sleep at night.

766
00:57:03,344 --> 00:57:05,597
And it don't get changed till
I get there in the morning.

767
00:57:05,763 --> 00:57:08,607
That about ten hours
she gotta sleep in her mess.

768
00:57:09,934 --> 00:57:12,528
Now Miss Leefolt pregnant
with her second baby.

769
00:57:13,354 --> 00:57:16,699
Lord... I pray this child
turn out good.

770
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:20,407
It's a lonely road if a mama
don't think their child is pretty.

771
00:57:23,364 --> 00:57:25,207
That's very true.

772
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:31,046
Miss Leefolt should not
be having babies.

773
00:57:35,501 --> 00:57:36,626
Write that down.

774
00:57:43,759 --> 00:57:46,433
Treelore would like me doing this.

775
00:57:46,595 --> 00:57:49,394
He always said we were gonna have
a writer in the family one day.

776
00:57:49,556 --> 00:57:51,979
I always thought it was gonna be him.
Maybe it's gonna be me.

777
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,028
Aibileen, Aibileen.

778
00:57:55,187 --> 00:57:57,986
They done set a bomb off
in Medgar Evers' carport.

779
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:10,290
Yule Mae told me what y'all was up to.
I didn't want to believe it.

780
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,129
And just what makes you think
colored people need your help?

781
00:58:17,249 --> 00:58:18,842
- Why do you care?
- Minny.

782
00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:20,799
Maybe you just want
to get Aibileen in trouble.

783
00:58:20,961 --> 00:58:22,554
No.

784
00:58:22,713 --> 00:58:25,091
I want to show her perspective.

785
00:58:25,257 --> 00:58:28,932
So people might understand
what it's like from your side.

786
00:58:29,095 --> 00:58:31,769
Well, it's a real Fourth of July picnic.

787
00:58:32,348 --> 00:58:35,602
It's what we dream of doing
all weekend long.

788
00:58:35,768 --> 00:58:38,521
Get back into they house,
polish the silver.

789
00:58:38,687 --> 00:58:43,284
And we just love not making minimum wage
or getting Social Security.

790
00:58:45,236 --> 00:58:48,160
And how we love they children
when they little.

791
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:52,118
And then they turn out
just like they mamas.

792
00:58:52,284 --> 00:58:53,331
I know.

793
00:58:55,371 --> 00:58:56,873
Maybe things can change.

794
00:58:57,039 --> 00:58:59,132
What law's gonna say you
gotta be nice to your maid?

795
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:00,837
You don't have to do this now, Minny.

796
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,627
You damn right I don't!

797
00:59:03,461 --> 00:59:05,509
You two give me the heart palpitations.

798
00:59:10,009 --> 00:59:11,101
And that's a good mood.

799
00:59:23,231 --> 00:59:25,654
All right. I'm gonna do it.

800
00:59:25,817 --> 00:59:29,788
But I need to make sure she understands
this ain't no game we playing here.

801
00:59:31,823 --> 00:59:34,451
Slide your chair out from under
that table. Face me.

802
00:59:37,245 --> 00:59:40,999
I need to see you square on
at all times.

803
00:59:50,716 --> 00:59:52,309
I gotta come up with
your questions, too?

804
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:53,559
Oh.

805
00:59:54,928 --> 00:59:59,149
Uh, let's begin
with where you were born.

806
00:59:59,308 --> 01:00:03,063
Belzoni, Mississippi,
on my great-auntie's sofa.

807
01:00:03,228 --> 01:00:04,354
Next.

808
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:06,865
- I put the green beans in first.
- OK.

809
01:00:07,024 --> 01:00:10,153
Then I get on the pork chops so I can
get started on that cornbread.

810
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:13,823
Once Minny got to talking
about food, she liked to never stop.

811
01:00:15,574 --> 01:00:19,295
And when she got to talking about
the white ladies, it took all night.

812
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:23,958
Then she say, "Oh, Minny,
I'm gonna give you a paid vacation. "

813
01:00:24,123 --> 01:00:26,672
I ain't never had no paid vacation
in my life.

814
01:00:26,834 --> 01:00:29,428
A week later I come back,
and they done moved to Mobile.

815
01:00:30,796 --> 01:00:34,016
Miss Lazy Fingers scared I'd find
a new job before she moved.

816
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,223
Ain't that right, Aibileen?

817
01:00:41,933 --> 01:00:43,560
We gots to get some more maids.

818
01:00:44,602 --> 01:00:47,071
It hard. You go try and see.

819
01:00:49,357 --> 01:00:50,859
OK, I will.

820
01:00:57,323 --> 01:00:58,700
We gone and done it now.

821
01:01:01,284 --> 01:01:06,461
Skeeter! Get down here! Something just
arrived from New York for you.

822
01:01:22,055 --> 01:01:23,056
What is that?

823
01:01:23,223 --> 01:01:26,898
The Shinalator.
All the way from New York City.

824
01:01:27,727 --> 01:01:30,606
I'm a good mother.
Come on. Sit down.

825
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:37,412
The whole system cost 11 dollars.
Even smells expensive.

826
01:01:39,072 --> 01:01:42,496
You're gonna look beautiful
on your date tonight.

827
01:01:42,658 --> 01:01:45,002
I can feel the hope in your fingers.

828
01:01:47,997 --> 01:01:49,999
Holy shit.

829
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:52,759
- You shrunk five inches.
- Oh, my God.

830
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:54,966
You'll be able to wear heels tonight.

831
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:59,141
You're not leaving the house in those
awful Mexican man shoes.

832
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,392
Can I take the Cadillac?

833
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:02,974
We promised the Cadillac
to Carlton and Rebecca tonight,

834
01:02:03,137 --> 01:02:06,266
so William's cousin will just
have to come pick you up himself.

835
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:09,026
- I'll take the truck.
- It's hooked up to the motor grader.

836
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:10,185
I'll drive slow.

837
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:13,105
Skeeter! Skeeter!

838
01:02:13,272 --> 01:02:18,119
Now remember, no gentleman wants
to spend the evening with a sourpuss.

839
01:02:18,277 --> 01:02:21,531
Don't mope! Smile!

840
01:02:21,697 --> 01:02:27,044
And for heaven's sakes, don't sit like
some squaw Indian! Cross your ankles!

841
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,712
I love you!

842
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,765
Stuart, she'll be here any minute.

843
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:43,597
Hey. -

844
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,271
Skeeter.

845
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,649
Boys, we'll be right back. Y'all talk
about quarterbacks or something.

846
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:55,609
Yule Mae, get Miss Skeeter a Coca-Cola.

847
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:56,944
Yes, ma'am.

848
01:03:11,161 --> 01:03:12,162
Want a drink?

849
01:03:12,329 --> 01:03:14,127
Just water, please.

850
01:03:15,582 --> 01:03:19,553
Double Old Kentucky, straight
with a water back. Make that two backs.

851
01:03:19,711 --> 01:03:22,590
You sure you don't want to just make it
the whole bottle and a straw?

852
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:26,056
Honey, there's the lieutenant governor.
Let's go say hi.

853
01:03:30,514 --> 01:03:33,017
Good to see you, sir.
You remember my wife?

854
01:03:33,183 --> 01:03:34,400
Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

855
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:42,781
So, what do you do with your time?

856
01:03:43,944 --> 01:03:44,991
You work?

857
01:03:45,778 --> 01:03:47,200
I write.

858
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:50,742
But right now I'm working on
a domestic maintenance column

859
01:03:50,908 --> 01:03:52,000
for The Jackson Journal.

860
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,292
You mean housekeeping.

861
01:03:56,455 --> 01:04:00,005
Jesus, I can't think of anything worse
than reading a cleaning column,

862
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:02,010
except for maybe writing one.

863
01:04:02,169 --> 01:04:03,716
Well, I can.

864
01:04:03,879 --> 01:04:07,975
Working with a bunch of greasy,
stinky men in the middle of the ocean.

865
01:04:08,134 --> 01:04:11,638
It sounds like a ploy to find a husband,
becoming an expert in keeping house.

866
01:04:11,804 --> 01:04:15,434
Well, aren't you a genius?
You figured out my whole scheme.

867
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:18,819
Isn't that what all you girls
from Ole Miss major in...

868
01:04:18,978 --> 01:04:20,696
...professional husband hunting?

869
01:04:20,855 --> 01:04:23,779
Who is hungry?

870
01:04:23,941 --> 01:04:27,535
I'm sorry, but were you dropped
on your head as an infant?

871
01:04:27,694 --> 01:04:29,287
Or were you just born stupid?

872
01:04:51,134 --> 01:04:53,182
So, what can you cook?

873
01:04:54,471 --> 01:04:57,771
Oh, um, I can cook cornpone.

874
01:04:58,933 --> 01:05:00,435
Boil potatoes.

875
01:05:01,478 --> 01:05:02,570
I can do grits.

876
01:05:06,107 --> 01:05:07,153
Well...

877
01:05:08,066 --> 01:05:11,991
...I reckon if there's anything you
ought to know about cooking, it's this.

878
01:05:12,154 --> 01:05:15,249
The most important invention since
they put mayonnaise in a jar.

879
01:05:17,409 --> 01:05:19,377
You got gum in your hair,

880
01:05:19,536 --> 01:05:21,755
you got a squeaky door hinge...

881
01:05:21,914 --> 01:05:22,915
Crisco.

882
01:05:24,666 --> 01:05:26,293
How pretty.

883
01:05:28,212 --> 01:05:30,135
Looks like frosting.

884
01:05:30,297 --> 01:05:33,176
You got bags under your eyes.

885
01:05:33,342 --> 01:05:35,310
Want to soften your husband's
scaly feet.

886
01:05:36,428 --> 01:05:38,055
Mm-hm. Crisco.

887
01:05:39,473 --> 01:05:42,522
But it's best for frying chicken.

888
01:05:43,769 --> 01:05:45,442
Frying chicken just...

889
01:05:46,605 --> 01:05:48,698
...tend to make you
feel better about life.

890
01:05:52,235 --> 01:05:53,657
At least me, anyway.

891
01:05:55,029 --> 01:05:57,703
Mm, I love me some fried chicken.

892
01:05:59,283 --> 01:06:00,375
Now...

893
01:06:02,411 --> 01:06:03,412
...shake that.

894
01:06:03,579 --> 01:06:05,081
Oh.

895
01:06:09,919 --> 01:06:12,763
This is so much fun!

896
01:06:14,173 --> 01:06:17,643
All right, all right.
The chicken already dead, Miss Celia.

897
01:06:21,389 --> 01:06:22,766
Yep. He dead.

898
01:06:33,942 --> 01:06:35,285
There you are.

899
01:06:36,611 --> 01:06:41,492
I'm starved. Looks so good.

900
01:06:42,033 --> 01:06:43,751
We done been over this, Miss Celia.

901
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:47,790
You supposed to eat in the dining room.
That's how it works.

902
01:06:47,956 --> 01:06:49,128
Let me take your plate back.

903
01:06:49,791 --> 01:06:51,885
I'm fine right here, Minny.

904
01:07:11,395 --> 01:07:12,396
What?

905
01:07:13,856 --> 01:07:16,075
I just want you to know
I'm real grateful you're here.

906
01:07:16,233 --> 01:07:18,986
You gots plenty more
to be grateful for than me.

907
01:07:20,404 --> 01:07:23,749
And look, now I ain't
messing around no more.

908
01:07:23,907 --> 01:07:25,204
Now Mr. Johnny gonna catch me here,

909
01:07:25,367 --> 01:07:28,211
and shoot me dead right here
on this no-wax floor.

910
01:07:29,288 --> 01:07:30,335
You gots to tell him.

911
01:07:30,497 --> 01:07:33,341
Ain't he wondering how
the cooking's so good?

912
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,127
You're right.

913
01:07:36,962 --> 01:07:38,964
Maybe we ought to
burn the chicken a little.

914
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:42,723
Minny don't burn chicken.

915
01:07:45,429 --> 01:07:49,059
I like this Sarah Ross. She testifies
without complaining too much.

916
01:07:49,224 --> 01:07:52,853
And that Bertha,
she's got chutzpah, I'll give her that.

917
01:07:53,019 --> 01:07:54,362
So you liked it?

918
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,148
Eugenia, Martin Luther King
just invited

919
01:07:57,315 --> 01:08:00,285
the entire country to march with him
in D.C. in August.

920
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:01,786
This many Negroes and whites

921
01:08:01,944 --> 01:08:04,322
have not worked together since
Gone with the Wind.

922
01:08:04,489 --> 01:08:07,242
How many stories have you
recorded thus far?

923
01:08:07,408 --> 01:08:09,410
The ones you've read.

924
01:08:09,577 --> 01:08:11,420
Two domestics, that's all?

925
01:08:13,665 --> 01:08:15,588
I'm real close to
getting more interviews.

926
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:19,755
Don't send me anything else
until you do have more maids.

927
01:08:19,921 --> 01:08:22,765
Yes, ma'am. How... how many more?

928
01:08:22,924 --> 01:08:25,803
I don't know. At least a dozen.

929
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:29,313
My advice to you is to write it
and write it fast

930
01:08:29,472 --> 01:08:31,816
before this whole civil rights thing
blows over.

931
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:33,646
Now good night to you, Miss Phelan.

932
01:08:46,113 --> 01:08:48,161
We need a dozen more.

933
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:53,245
Me and Aibileen done asked everybody
we know. Thirty-one maids.

934
01:08:54,162 --> 01:08:56,210
They all too scared. Think we crazy.

935
01:08:58,083 --> 01:09:00,211
If we don't get more,
we're not getting published.

936
01:09:00,377 --> 01:09:03,347
I gots plenty stories,
Miss Skeeter.

937
01:09:03,505 --> 01:09:07,100
Just write them down
and invent the maid that said it.

938
01:09:07,259 --> 01:09:09,808
You're already making up names.
Just make up the maids, too.

939
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:13,894
We're not gonna do that.
That would be wrong.

940
01:09:14,056 --> 01:09:15,399
Don't give up on this, Miss Skeeter.

941
01:09:15,558 --> 01:09:17,185
It wouldn't be real.

942
01:09:18,728 --> 01:09:20,275
They Killed my son.

943
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:30,323
He fell carrying two-by-fours
at the mill.

944
01:09:31,907 --> 01:09:34,080
Truck run over him, crushed his lung.

945
01:09:34,243 --> 01:09:35,836
Aibileen.

946
01:09:39,165 --> 01:09:41,918
That white foreman threw his body
on back of a truck.

947
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:45,589
Drove to the colored hospital...

948
01:09:45,755 --> 01:09:47,723
...dumped him there and honked the horn.

949
01:09:58,183 --> 01:10:02,404
There was nothing they could do,
so I brought my baby home.

950
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:09,403
Laid him down on that sofa right there.

951
01:10:13,031 --> 01:10:15,033
He died right in front of me.

952
01:10:17,619 --> 01:10:21,249
He was just 24 years old, Miss Skeeter.
Best part of a person's life.

953
01:10:22,874 --> 01:10:26,469
Anniversary of his death comes...

954
01:10:26,628 --> 01:10:29,006
...every year, and I can't breathe.

955
01:10:29,172 --> 01:10:31,391
But to y'all, it's just
another day of bridge.

956
01:10:35,844 --> 01:10:37,312
You stop this...

957
01:10:38,597 --> 01:10:42,397
...everything I wrote, he wrote,
everything he was is gonna die with him.

958
01:10:52,611 --> 01:10:55,831
I am just honored
to be hosting Elizabeth's shower.

959
01:10:55,989 --> 01:10:58,208
Doesn't she look glowing, everybody?

960
01:10:58,367 --> 01:11:00,836
Yes, she does!

961
01:11:00,994 --> 01:11:03,417
Honey, you hold on to it,
to the bitter end.

962
01:11:05,082 --> 01:11:07,130
- I'll try.
- Well, congratulations.

963
01:11:09,169 --> 01:11:11,263
I'm hungry, Mommy.

964
01:11:11,421 --> 01:11:12,593
She's always hungry.

965
01:11:15,592 --> 01:11:17,184
You know she can hear you, Elizabeth.

966
01:11:17,343 --> 01:11:21,598
I'll cut you
a piece of cake, baby. Go on, now.

967
01:11:25,643 --> 01:11:30,490
Aibileen, are you enjoying your new
bathroom over at Elizabeth's'?

968
01:11:30,648 --> 01:11:34,403
Nice to have your own.
Isn't it, Aibileen?

969
01:11:38,948 --> 01:11:42,248
Yes, ma'am. And I thank you.

970
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:45,084
Separate, but equal.

971
01:11:45,788 --> 01:11:48,211
That's what Ross Barnett says,
and you can't argue with the governor.

972
01:11:48,374 --> 01:11:52,595
Well, certainly not in Mississippi,
the birthplace of modern-day government.

973
01:12:08,935 --> 01:12:12,360
Hey, Miss Skeeter.
Can I get you something?

974
01:12:12,522 --> 01:12:13,523
No, thanks.

975
01:12:14,816 --> 01:12:17,194
Yule Mae, I wanted to talk to you
about something.

976
01:12:19,779 --> 01:12:21,952
I already know what you're gonna ask,
Miss Skeeter.

977
01:12:24,576 --> 01:12:26,328
Minny and Aibileen already did.

978
01:12:31,499 --> 01:12:34,093
I'm trying to get my boys
off to college.

979
01:12:35,962 --> 01:12:38,965
It's worthwhile what
y'all are doing, but...

980
01:12:39,131 --> 01:12:41,725
...but my boys are worth more.

981
01:12:42,509 --> 01:12:43,556
I understand.

982
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:50,901
What do you understand, Skeeter?

983
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:57,651
Yule Mae was just saying how excited she
is that her boys are going to college.

984
01:12:58,484 --> 01:13:01,158
Did you also ask Miss Skeeter
if you could borrow money?

985
01:13:01,987 --> 01:13:03,330
Of course not.

986
01:13:05,491 --> 01:13:07,493
I'm gonna put Billy down for his nap.

987
01:13:09,453 --> 01:13:10,875
Excuse me.

988
01:13:13,916 --> 01:13:15,259
Come on, baby.

989
01:13:22,924 --> 01:13:27,680
Skeeter, are you intentionally not
putting my initiative in the newsletter?

990
01:13:27,845 --> 01:13:31,645
No, not at all. I just have been
really busy with Mama.

991
01:13:31,808 --> 01:13:33,651
I know.

992
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:37,440
I know, you must be so worried
about your mother, but...

993
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,362
I'm worried about you.

994
01:13:41,401 --> 01:13:42,994
Reading this stuff?

995
01:13:43,861 --> 01:13:47,786
Believe it or not, there are real
racists in this town.

996
01:13:48,533 --> 01:13:50,706
If the wrong person caught you
with anything like that,

997
01:13:50,868 --> 01:13:52,870
you'd be in serious trouble.

998
01:13:54,747 --> 01:13:56,420
I'll be on the lookout.

999
01:14:00,627 --> 01:14:02,629
Put my initiative in the newsletter.

1000
01:14:06,299 --> 01:14:07,516
OK?

1001
01:14:57,016 --> 01:14:59,235
Skeeter, get up!

1002
01:14:59,393 --> 01:15:01,737
- No! What?
- We've got to get dressed.

1003
01:15:03,481 --> 01:15:04,607
What's wrong?

1004
01:15:04,774 --> 01:15:07,118
Don't panic. Don't panic.

1005
01:15:07,276 --> 01:15:12,157
There's a particularly tall and very
handsome man named Stuart here for you.

1006
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,083
Oh, God.

1007
01:15:15,242 --> 01:15:17,244
Oh, mother.

1008
01:15:17,411 --> 01:15:19,960
You would not like him. Trust me.

1009
01:15:20,122 --> 01:15:21,374
He's a drunken asshole.

1010
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:25,760
Love and hate are two horns on the same
goat, Eugenia, and you need a goat.

1011
01:15:25,919 --> 01:15:28,047
Put that on. Hurry!

1012
01:15:34,844 --> 01:15:36,221
Look, I know it was a few weeks back,

1013
01:15:36,387 --> 01:15:40,312
but I came to say I'm sorry
for the way I acted.

1014
01:15:40,475 --> 01:15:42,443
Who sent you, William or Hilly?

1015
01:15:42,602 --> 01:15:43,728
Neither.

1016
01:15:43,895 --> 01:15:46,273
Hilly. But I wanted to come, OK.

1017
01:15:46,439 --> 01:15:48,533
I was rude, and I've been
thinking about it a lot.

1018
01:15:49,109 --> 01:15:52,113
- Well, I haven't. So you can just go.
- Goddamn it!

1019
01:15:53,988 --> 01:15:57,868
I told Hilly I wasn't ready to go out on
any date. Wasn't even close to ready.

1020
01:16:02,413 --> 01:16:04,881
I was engaged last year. She ended it.

1021
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,383
I'm sure she did.

1022
01:16:06,542 --> 01:16:08,965
It's not like that.
I'm not always a jerk.

1023
01:16:11,463 --> 01:16:14,808
We had been dating since we were 15,
and you know how it is.

1024
01:16:14,967 --> 01:16:17,971
Actually, I don't. I've never really
dated anyone before.

1025
01:16:18,595 --> 01:16:19,596
Ever?

1026
01:16:20,681 --> 01:16:21,682
Ever.

1027
01:16:23,684 --> 01:16:26,062
All right, I, uh...

1028
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:29,448
Well, that must be it, then.

1029
01:16:29,606 --> 01:16:30,949
- What?
- You, Skeeter.

1030
01:16:31,108 --> 01:16:33,531
I've never met a woman that says
exactly what she's thinking.

1031
01:16:33,694 --> 01:16:36,493
- Well, I got plenty to say.
- Yeah, I'll bet you do.

1032
01:16:38,365 --> 01:16:40,493
You make me laugh, smile.

1033
01:16:44,288 --> 01:16:46,005
Would you like to come
have dinner with me?

1034
01:16:47,582 --> 01:16:50,927
We could talk. I could actually
listen to you this time.

1035
01:16:51,878 --> 01:16:53,801
I can't think of anything worse.

1036
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:57,388
I understand, and I'm sorry.

1037
01:16:57,550 --> 01:17:00,099
That's what
I came here to say, and I said it.

1038
01:17:07,435 --> 01:17:08,527
Just give me a minute.

1039
01:17:09,478 --> 01:17:10,730
Let me get my sweater.

1040
01:17:16,903 --> 01:17:18,576
Not a big fan of oysters, huh?

1041
01:17:18,738 --> 01:17:21,457
Oysters are a vehicle
for crackers and ketchup.

1042
01:17:23,159 --> 01:17:25,537
Well, here's to new beginnings.

1043
01:17:31,249 --> 01:17:32,717
Mm.

1044
01:17:34,836 --> 01:17:35,928
You're disgusting.

1045
01:17:36,087 --> 01:17:37,680
You've already made that pretty clear.

1046
01:17:38,715 --> 01:17:41,389
And just so you know,
the boys caught me reading

1047
01:17:41,551 --> 01:17:43,519
your Miss Myrna column
on the rig the other day.

1048
01:17:43,678 --> 01:17:46,181
Really? You read them?

1049
01:17:46,348 --> 01:17:47,349
All of them.

1050
01:17:48,308 --> 01:17:49,685
Very informative, too.

1051
01:17:49,851 --> 01:17:52,650
I had no idea that ground egg shells
got grease out of clothes.

1052
01:17:52,812 --> 01:17:54,234
Well, I do my homework.

1053
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,993
You're a good writer, Skeeter.

1054
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:04,491
Thank you.

1055
01:18:07,201 --> 01:18:08,828
I want to be a journalist.

1056
01:18:09,912 --> 01:18:13,041
Or maybe a novelist. Or maybe both.

1057
01:18:13,749 --> 01:18:15,171
I like that.

1058
01:18:17,503 --> 01:18:19,847
You're really smart. And pretty.

1059
01:18:28,722 --> 01:18:30,065
Skeeter.

1060
01:18:31,392 --> 01:18:33,235
I hope you get to write something
really good.

1061
01:18:34,436 --> 01:18:35,779
Something you believe in.

1062
01:18:48,199 --> 01:18:49,200
Hello?

1063
01:18:51,452 --> 01:18:54,547
What? I'm coming!

1064
01:18:54,706 --> 01:18:58,085
Aibileen! Come on. We have to go
help Hilly. Right now!

1065
01:19:02,714 --> 01:19:06,218
Oh! You're trespassing!

1066
01:19:06,384 --> 01:19:08,307
It's Skeeter!

1067
01:19:08,469 --> 01:19:09,812
She put it in the newsletter.

1068
01:19:09,971 --> 01:19:11,188
Oh, my God.

1069
01:19:11,347 --> 01:19:15,978
I specifically said,
"Drop old coats at my house. "

1070
01:19:16,144 --> 01:19:18,192
Not commodes!

1071
01:19:18,354 --> 01:19:20,197
Why would she do this to me?

1072
01:19:20,356 --> 01:19:22,199
I don't know. I don't Know, Hilly.

1073
01:19:22,358 --> 01:19:25,032
It's so embarrassing.

1074
01:19:33,076 --> 01:19:34,794
Oh, Lord.

1075
01:19:34,953 --> 01:19:36,330
I go potty, Mommy.

1076
01:19:37,331 --> 01:19:39,379
No! Mae Mobley!

1077
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,589
You get off of that toilet!

1078
01:19:43,253 --> 01:19:45,551
- You will catch diseases, you hear me?
- Mommy!

1079
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:47,716
You will catch diseases
on those toilets.

1080
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:05,576
You is kind, you is smart,

1081
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:07,953
you is important.

1082
01:20:18,412 --> 01:20:21,382
Don't shop for anything
on Capitol Street.

1083
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:26,421
Let's let the merchants down on
Capitol Street feel the economic pinch.

1084
01:20:26,587 --> 01:20:28,510
Let me say this to you.

1085
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:31,391
I had one merchant to call me,
and he said,

1086
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:36,181
"I want you to know that I've
talked to my national office today,

1087
01:20:36,347 --> 01:20:39,647
and they want me to tell you that we
don't need nigger business. "

1088
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:44,815
These are stores that help to support
the White Citizens' Council,

1089
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:49,201
the council that is dedicated to keeping
you and I second-class citizens.

1090
01:20:49,735 --> 01:20:51,202
Mama!

1091
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:55,577
Don't encourage them like that.

1092
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:58,118
- That is national news.
- I won't have it!

1093
01:21:01,037 --> 01:21:02,334
You understand?

1094
01:21:12,757 --> 01:21:14,100
How you doing, Miss Clark?

1095
01:21:15,718 --> 01:21:18,312
All right, Henry.

1096
01:21:18,471 --> 01:21:20,348
Thank you. How you doing?

1097
01:21:21,683 --> 01:21:25,438
If God is willing, Miss Clark.
If God is willing.

1098
01:21:25,603 --> 01:21:27,025
That's good.

1099
01:21:27,188 --> 01:21:28,781
- Yeah.
- That's good.

1100
01:21:37,489 --> 01:21:38,866
What's going on out there, mister?

1101
01:21:39,032 --> 01:21:41,000
Colored people off.

1102
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:42,753
The rest of you,
let me know where you're going.

1103
01:21:42,911 --> 01:21:44,037
I'll get you close as I can.

1104
01:21:44,204 --> 01:21:45,797
What happened?

1105
01:21:45,956 --> 01:21:47,754
I don't know. Some nigger got shot.

1106
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:50,718
- Where you headed?
- Woodrow Wilson.

1107
01:21:50,878 --> 01:21:52,846
Woodrow Wilson. All right.

1108
01:22:01,972 --> 01:22:05,772
- You gonna be all right, Miss Clark?
- I'll be all right. You go on now.

1109
01:22:05,934 --> 01:22:08,187
- You want me to walk you?
- No, thank you. I'll be all right.

1110
01:22:09,521 --> 01:22:10,864
You have a good night.

1111
01:22:11,523 --> 01:22:13,240
Which way you going?

1112
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:24,210
We View this as a cold,

1113
01:22:24,368 --> 01:22:26,336
brutal, deliberate...

1114
01:22:27,497 --> 01:22:31,752
...killing in a savage,
uncivilized state.

1115
01:22:31,918 --> 01:22:37,095
There is no state with a record that
approaches that of Mississippi

1116
01:22:37,256 --> 01:22:41,432
in inhumanity murder, brutality

1117
01:22:41,594 --> 01:22:43,642
and racial hatred.

1118
01:22:43,804 --> 01:22:47,479
It is absolutely at the bottom
of the list.

1119
01:22:48,976 --> 01:22:50,102
Fifteen minutes past midnight,

1120
01:22:50,269 --> 01:22:54,023
Evers got out of his car beside his home
in a Negro residential area.

1121
01:22:54,189 --> 01:22:56,112
In a vacant lot about 40 yards away

1122
01:22:56,274 --> 01:22:59,699
a sniper fired a single shot from a
high-powered rifle at Evers' silhouette.

1123
01:22:59,861 --> 01:23:02,205
I'm all right. Sit down. You all right?

1124
01:23:02,364 --> 01:23:03,957
- I'm OK.
- The bullet hit him in the back,

1125
01:23:04,115 --> 01:23:06,994
crashed through his body
through a window, into the house.

1126
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,629
He died within an hour
at a Jackson hospital.

1127
01:23:09,788 --> 01:23:12,132
City detectives believe the fatal shot
was fired from...

1128
01:23:12,290 --> 01:23:16,295
KKK shot him. An hour ago.

1129
01:23:18,046 --> 01:23:20,014
Right in front of his children,
Aibileen.

1130
01:23:21,591 --> 01:23:24,640
We're gonna pray for the Evers.
We're gonna pray for Myrlie.

1131
01:23:24,803 --> 01:23:28,148
We living in hell. Trapped.

1132
01:23:29,099 --> 01:23:30,521
Our kids, trapped.

1133
01:23:33,979 --> 01:23:36,481
Sugar, take your brothers and sisters
and y'all go on to bed.

1134
01:23:41,944 --> 01:23:43,787
Good night.

1135
01:23:43,946 --> 01:23:46,290
Good night. Good night.

1136
01:23:48,659 --> 01:23:50,832
Oh. Good night, baby.

1137
01:24:02,423 --> 01:24:04,551
What they gonna do if they catch us
with Miss Skeeter?

1138
01:24:05,551 --> 01:24:06,928
We're gonna be careful.

1139
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:12,942
Hitch us to a pickup? Drag us behind?
Shoot me in front of my children?

1140
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:15,603
We ain't doing civil rights.

1141
01:24:15,769 --> 01:24:18,692
We're just telling stories
like they really happened.

1142
01:24:20,565 --> 01:24:22,909
You're a fool, old woman.

1143
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:25,532
A fool.

1144
01:24:56,100 --> 01:25:01,071
Miss Phelan, the presses are heating up.
We needed Miss Myrna 30 minutes ago.

1145
01:25:01,688 --> 01:25:02,689
Yes, Sir.

1146
01:25:02,856 --> 01:25:04,403
Chop-chop.

1147
01:25:05,692 --> 01:25:07,069
Good Lord.

1148
01:25:23,001 --> 01:25:24,753
Miss Celia?

1149
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,567
Miss Celia?

1150
01:25:43,729 --> 01:25:45,731
Go home.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1151
01:25:45,898 --> 01:25:48,151
You mess up your hair coloring again?

1152
01:25:48,317 --> 01:25:51,787
I helped you ix it last time.
We got it back to butter batch.

1153
01:25:51,946 --> 01:25:53,539
Was real pretty, remember?

1154
01:25:57,576 --> 01:25:58,919
Miss Celia.

1155
01:26:00,037 --> 01:26:01,880
I told you, go home!

1156
01:26:17,847 --> 01:26:19,393
I said get out!

1157
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,829
Why is there so much blood?

1158
01:26:43,413 --> 01:26:47,338
Next one's gonna catch, Miss Celia.
You just wait and see.

1159
01:26:49,669 --> 01:26:52,343
We got married 'cause I was pregnant.

1160
01:26:54,758 --> 01:26:57,102
Then I lost it a month later.

1161
01:26:59,637 --> 01:27:01,604
Johnny wants kids now.

1162
01:27:05,142 --> 01:27:06,894
What's he gonna do with me?

1163
01:27:09,938 --> 01:27:11,190
Well...

1164
01:27:12,608 --> 01:27:14,610
Mr. Johnny just gonna have
to get over it.

1165
01:27:17,154 --> 01:27:19,202
He doesn't know about the baby.

1166
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:25,287
Or the two before.

1167
01:28:20,174 --> 01:28:21,517
Yule Mae Davis?

1168
01:28:24,427 --> 01:28:26,725
- What do you want me to do?
- You're under arrest.

1169
01:28:27,931 --> 01:28:31,276
Just call my husband.
Just call my husband.

1170
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:38,280
- Wait a minute. I want my purse.
- No, you're under arrest.

1171
01:28:38,441 --> 01:28:42,241
I want to get my purse.
I want to get my purse! Aibee!

1172
01:28:43,029 --> 01:28:45,202
- Don't fight, Yule Mae!
- Aibee!

1173
01:28:45,365 --> 01:28:49,461
Aibee, I want my purse! I want my purse!

1174
01:28:53,373 --> 01:28:55,296
Just let me go!

1175
01:28:56,084 --> 01:28:58,337
Yule Mae, don't fight.

1176
01:29:06,886 --> 01:29:10,015
I knew she was a thief
the day she started.

1177
01:29:10,848 --> 01:29:15,024
A nigra walks into a pawn shop
with a ring of such size and color.

1178
01:29:16,353 --> 01:29:19,448
It took them all of ten minutes
to find out where she worked.

1179
01:29:21,483 --> 01:29:23,781
I am desperate for
a grilled cheese sandwich.

1180
01:29:23,944 --> 01:29:26,367
Are you? Are you?
Do you want a grilled cheese sandwich?

1181
01:29:26,530 --> 01:29:28,203
Oh, yes.

1182
01:29:28,365 --> 01:29:30,117
Just go sit down over there.

1183
01:29:36,790 --> 01:29:41,170
Miss Skeeter, you best head on over
to Miss Aibileen's house.

1184
01:29:41,962 --> 01:29:42,963
Now.

1185
01:30:13,451 --> 01:30:15,624
I'm gonna help with your stories.

1186
01:30:16,996 --> 01:30:19,340
I'm gonna help, too. Mm-hm.

1187
01:30:21,209 --> 01:30:22,381
We all are.

1188
01:30:22,543 --> 01:30:25,512
- That's right.
- I'll help you.

1189
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:29,349
I used to take
a shortcut every day

1190
01:30:29,508 --> 01:30:32,227
when I went to work
at Dr. Dixon's house.

1191
01:30:32,886 --> 01:30:35,935
Cut through that farmer's lower 40
to get there.

1192
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:39,944
One day this farmer
was waiting for me with a gun.

1193
01:30:40,102 --> 01:30:43,697
Said he'd shoot me dead
if I walked on his land again.

1194
01:30:44,398 --> 01:30:50,121
Dr. Dixon went and paid that farmer
double for two of those acres.

1195
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:53,498
Told him he was gonna
start farming, too.

1196
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:59,125
But he bought that just for me,
so I could get to work easy.

1197
01:31:00,414 --> 01:31:01,631
He did.

1198
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:04,839
I worked for Miss Jolene's mother
till the day she died.

1199
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:09,214
Then her daughter, Miss Nancy,
asked me to come and work for her.

1200
01:31:10,297 --> 01:31:12,595
Miss Nancy is a real sweet lady.

1201
01:31:13,592 --> 01:31:17,972
But Miss Jolene's ma done put it in her
will I got to work for Miss Jolene.

1202
01:31:19,015 --> 01:31:21,859
Miss Jolene's a mean woman.

1203
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:23,565
Mean for sport.

1204
01:31:25,896 --> 01:31:28,570
Lord, I tried to find another job.

1205
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:31,778
But in everybody's mind

1206
01:31:31,944 --> 01:31:35,323
the French family
and Miss Jolene owned me.

1207
01:31:37,491 --> 01:31:38,834
Owned me.

1208
01:31:44,582 --> 01:31:46,380
I leave early
this week for Thanksgiving.

1209
01:31:46,542 --> 01:31:49,340
Our last editors' meeting
is December 17th,

1210
01:31:49,502 --> 01:31:51,254
so if you want a prayer
of this getting read,

1211
01:31:51,421 --> 01:31:54,425
- I'd better have it by then.
- That's in three weeks, Miss Stein.

1212
01:31:54,591 --> 01:31:57,094
Well, otherwise it goes in the pile.

1213
01:31:57,260 --> 01:32:00,059
You do not want it in the pile.

1214
01:32:00,221 --> 01:32:01,313
Yes, ma'am.

1215
01:32:01,473 --> 01:32:04,818
And put something personal in there.
Write about the maid who raised you.

1216
01:32:06,186 --> 01:32:07,529
I understand.

1217
01:32:15,195 --> 01:32:17,994
Well, we have a lot of work to do
before the benefit, don't we?

1218
01:32:18,156 --> 01:32:21,160
I know, but I think We're on track.
We're doing quite well.

1219
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,002
- it's so good.
- Mm-hm.

1220
01:32:31,168 --> 01:32:33,011
- Who's there?
- I don't know.

1221
01:32:33,796 --> 01:32:34,797
Aibileen?

1222
01:32:37,299 --> 01:32:38,892
Hey, Elizabeth!

1223
01:32:39,051 --> 01:32:41,395
It's me, Celia Foote.

1224
01:32:43,514 --> 01:32:46,984
I was in the neighborhood.
Thought I'd drop by.

1225
01:32:48,644 --> 01:32:51,363
Everybody hide.
Everybody get down, get down.

1226
01:32:52,272 --> 01:32:54,525
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1227
01:32:57,736 --> 01:32:59,659
- Turn off the music.
- Who are we hiding from?

1228
01:32:59,822 --> 01:33:01,665
Shh!

1229
01:33:04,993 --> 01:33:07,746
Hey!

1230
01:33:07,913 --> 01:33:08,960
Shh!

1231
01:33:12,875 --> 01:33:14,218
I brought a chocolate pie!

1232
01:33:16,546 --> 01:33:18,799
My maid, Minny, made it.

1233
01:33:26,139 --> 01:33:28,392
She's in the bushes.

1234
01:33:50,204 --> 01:33:54,959
Don't be taking those women
any more pies, you understand?

1235
01:34:03,258 --> 01:34:06,683
They made me stand there like I was
the vacuum salesman.

1236
01:34:08,763 --> 01:34:09,935
Why, Minny?

1237
01:34:12,058 --> 01:34:15,938
Because they know about you getting
knocked up by Mr. Johnny.

1238
01:34:16,104 --> 01:34:18,027
Mad you married one of their mens.

1239
01:34:18,857 --> 01:34:22,782
And especially since Miss Hilly and
Mr. Johnny had just broke up, too.

1240
01:34:22,944 --> 01:34:25,493
Hilly probably thinks that I was
fooling around with Johnny

1241
01:34:25,655 --> 01:34:27,328
when they were still going steady.

1242
01:34:27,490 --> 01:34:29,584
Mm-hm.

1243
01:34:29,743 --> 01:34:33,997
And Missus Walters always said Miss
Hilly still sweet on Mr. Johnny, too.

1244
01:34:35,873 --> 01:34:37,375
No wonder!

1245
01:34:40,377 --> 01:34:44,553
They don't hate me.
They hate what they think I did.

1246
01:34:45,424 --> 01:34:48,098
They hate you 'cause they think
you white trash.

1247
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:51,184
I'm just going to have to tell Hilly
I ain't no boyfriend stealer.

1248
01:34:52,806 --> 01:34:55,605
In fact, I'll tell her Friday night
at the benefit.

1249
01:34:56,727 --> 01:34:59,025
You don't need to be going
to that benefit, Miss Celia.

1250
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:03,784
Did you hear me? You just stay home.

1251
01:35:07,905 --> 01:35:09,077
That looks bad.

1252
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:12,792
Let me take a look.

1253
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:15,333
I got to get these peas on.

1254
01:35:15,495 --> 01:35:18,248
I know you didn't fall
in no tub, Minny.

1255
01:35:39,519 --> 01:35:42,068
You know what I'd do if I were you?

1256
01:35:43,815 --> 01:35:45,909
I'd give it right back to him.

1257
01:35:47,443 --> 01:35:50,322
I'd hit him over the head
with a skillet,

1258
01:35:50,488 --> 01:35:53,241
and I'd tell him, "Go straight to hell. "

1259
01:36:03,667 --> 01:36:06,011
From here, the members of the family...

1260
01:36:09,381 --> 01:36:12,726
...visitors from foreign countries
and others

1261
01:36:12,884 --> 01:36:15,888
will walk to St. Matthew's Cathedral.

1262
01:36:22,436 --> 01:36:25,235
Senator Edward Kennedy
getting out of the car.

1263
01:36:27,274 --> 01:36:28,617
Mrs. Kennedy.

1264
01:36:30,027 --> 01:36:32,029
Robert Kennedy, Attorney General.

1265
01:36:32,195 --> 01:36:34,289
Sweetheart, I gotta
get down to the coast.

1266
01:36:35,573 --> 01:36:37,200
I'll be back in time for the benefit.

1267
01:36:49,503 --> 01:36:51,926
The world done gone crazy,
Miss Skeeter, and I'm scared.

1268
01:36:52,673 --> 01:36:55,927
What if people ind out what we writing,
figure out Niceville really Jackson,

1269
01:36:56,093 --> 01:36:57,436
figure out who who?

1270
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:02,562
Maybe we need us some insurance.

1271
01:37:05,061 --> 01:37:08,531
I told God I'd never speak of it again.

1272
01:37:09,732 --> 01:37:11,530
But we ain't got no choice.

1273
01:37:13,027 --> 01:37:14,028
Sorry.

1274
01:37:15,154 --> 01:37:19,033
I need to tell y'all about the terrible
awful I done to Miss Hilly.

1275
01:37:20,533 --> 01:37:22,661
It might be the only thing
that keep us safe.

1276
01:37:27,582 --> 01:37:29,129
Mmm.

1277
01:37:29,292 --> 01:37:31,260
Mm-mm-mm.

1278
01:37:34,631 --> 01:37:35,883
So...

1279
01:37:37,717 --> 01:37:40,561
Nobody wanted to hire a sass-mouthing,
thieving nigra.

1280
01:37:43,431 --> 01:37:44,603
Did they?

1281
01:37:51,981 --> 01:37:54,575
Oh. Pie's as good as always, Minny.

1282
01:37:54,734 --> 01:37:55,986
I'm glad you like it.

1283
01:37:56,152 --> 01:37:57,528
Mmm.

1284
01:37:59,154 --> 01:38:01,202
Oh.

1285
01:38:01,365 --> 01:38:06,292
If I take you back, I'll have to cut
your pay five dollars a week.

1286
01:38:06,453 --> 01:38:07,921
Take me back?

1287
01:38:10,416 --> 01:38:14,171
What do you put in here
that makes it taste so good?

1288
01:38:14,336 --> 01:38:17,089
That good vanilla from Mexico...

1289
01:38:17,256 --> 01:38:19,884
...and something else real special.

1290
01:38:21,427 --> 01:38:22,679
Mmm.

1291
01:38:22,845 --> 01:38:27,021
No, no, no, Missus Walters.
That's Miss Hilly's special pie.

1292
01:38:30,018 --> 01:38:31,440
Mama can have a piece.

1293
01:38:33,439 --> 01:38:35,487
Cut her one.

1294
01:38:37,276 --> 01:38:38,618
Go get a plate.

1295
01:38:43,573 --> 01:38:44,790
Eat my shit.

1296
01:38:49,036 --> 01:38:50,413
What'd you say?

1297
01:38:50,997 --> 01:38:54,627
I said, "Eat... my... shit. "

1298
01:39:03,968 --> 01:39:05,561
Have you lost your mind?

1299
01:39:07,221 --> 01:39:12,523
No, ma'am, but you about to,
'cause you just did.

1300
01:39:13,227 --> 01:39:15,855
Did what?

1301
01:39:36,917 --> 01:39:38,965
And you didn't eat just one.

1302
01:39:39,127 --> 01:39:41,300
You had two slices!

1303
01:39:51,389 --> 01:39:54,142
Run, Minny, run!

1304
01:39:58,730 --> 01:40:00,322
You trying to get yourself killed?

1305
01:40:00,481 --> 01:40:03,405
No! I wasn't planning on telling.

1306
01:40:05,361 --> 01:40:07,204
I just wanted to see her take a bite.

1307
01:40:08,489 --> 01:40:12,369
Then I was gonna leave.
Be done with her forever.

1308
01:40:13,577 --> 01:40:16,296
Before I knew it, I had done
told that woman what was in that pie!

1309
01:40:19,291 --> 01:40:21,168
I done ask God to forgive me.

1310
01:40:23,170 --> 01:40:26,049
But more for what happened
to poor Miss Walters.

1311
01:40:28,092 --> 01:40:32,848
Miss Hilly threw her in that
nursing home... just for laughing.

1312
01:40:34,431 --> 01:40:36,149
We can't put that story in the book.

1313
01:40:37,017 --> 01:40:38,394
We ain't got no choice.

1314
01:40:39,103 --> 01:40:42,606
Hilly Holbrook can't let nobody know
that pie story about her.

1315
01:40:42,772 --> 01:40:44,900
Exactly. If people find out
the terrible awful

1316
01:40:45,066 --> 01:40:47,319
was you and Miss Hilly
we in trouble there ain't words for.

1317
01:40:47,485 --> 01:40:49,579
Right! But don't you see?

1318
01:40:49,737 --> 01:40:53,037
She gonna go to her grave convincing
folks this book ain't about Jackson.

1319
01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:55,952
Now, that keeps us safe. Insured.

1320
01:40:57,287 --> 01:40:58,664
No.

1321
01:40:59,706 --> 01:41:01,049
No, that's too dangerous.

1322
01:41:05,461 --> 01:41:08,840
Y'all two brought me into this,
but I'm gonna finish it.

1323
01:41:09,716 --> 01:41:13,061
Either put it in, or pull my parts
out altogether. Y'all pick!

1324
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:27,449
Thank you, Tommy. I should be out
by 10:00. See you then.

1325
01:41:33,071 --> 01:41:36,746
This is Jolene French, reporting from
the African Children's Benefit Ball,

1326
01:41:36,908 --> 01:41:40,253
and I'm here with League President,
Miss Hilly Holbrook.

1327
01:41:40,412 --> 01:41:44,918
Thanks, Jolene. And I'm just so excited
for the auction tonight, aren't you?

1328
01:41:45,083 --> 01:41:47,051
I'm absolutely thrilled.

1329
01:41:47,919 --> 01:41:49,512
Scandalous!

1330
01:41:52,132 --> 01:41:53,133
Thank you.

1331
01:42:02,933 --> 01:42:04,731
Hi!

1332
01:42:11,734 --> 01:42:13,407
Did you see what Miss Celia got on?

1333
01:42:13,569 --> 01:42:16,743
Lord, have mercy. Women better hold onto
their husbands tonight.

1334
01:42:18,199 --> 01:42:20,418
Miss Leefolt been working on that dress
for four weeks

1335
01:42:20,576 --> 01:42:21,702
and that's what she came up with?

1336
01:42:21,869 --> 01:42:24,543
Here.

1337
01:42:36,467 --> 01:42:37,639
Kiss me.

1338
01:43:11,626 --> 01:43:13,594
Everybody enjoying the evening?

1339
01:43:18,425 --> 01:43:21,429
Let's give a nice round of applause
for the help.

1340
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:28,400
For all the men and women who have
helped make tonight possible.

1341
01:43:30,185 --> 01:43:33,029
A cause I'm sure is dear
to their hearts as well.

1342
01:43:35,482 --> 01:43:37,610
- Your cocktail.
- Thank you.

1343
01:43:39,236 --> 01:43:43,412
Honey, don't you think
you've had enough to drink?

1344
01:43:43,574 --> 01:43:45,292
I wish you'd try and eat something.

1345
01:43:45,451 --> 01:43:47,670
I'm not having my stomach poke out.

1346
01:43:51,582 --> 01:43:55,462
OK, OK, everybody, quiet down.
I got the list of the winners!

1347
01:43:57,588 --> 01:43:58,840
OK.

1348
01:43:59,006 --> 01:44:03,762
The winner of the beautiful
mink car coat is...

1349
01:44:04,428 --> 01:44:05,645
...Charlotte Phelan!

1350
01:44:07,513 --> 01:44:09,265
Congrats, Miss Phelan.

1351
01:44:09,432 --> 01:44:11,605
Ladies, I hope
your husbands take note of that.

1352
01:44:13,144 --> 01:44:16,569
Now it's time for the baked goods.

1353
01:44:17,774 --> 01:44:19,697
Ooh, yummy, yummy!

1354
01:44:19,859 --> 01:44:23,079
The highest bid
in baked goods goes to

1355
01:44:23,237 --> 01:44:26,081
Minny Jackson's chocolate pie.

1356
01:44:27,867 --> 01:44:29,369
Congratulations...

1357
01:44:30,036 --> 01:44:31,754
...Hilly Holbrook!

1358
01:44:32,121 --> 01:44:36,297
- Oh! Hilly.
- That's funny.

1359
01:44:36,459 --> 01:44:38,132
I didn't bid on anything.

1360
01:44:38,294 --> 01:44:41,844
All right. And now it's time
for Danica's strawberry jam.

1361
01:44:42,006 --> 01:44:43,258
Shh!

1362
01:44:45,968 --> 01:44:47,844
Congratulations, Hilly!

1363
01:44:48,011 --> 01:44:51,140
I didn't know you were a fan
of Minny's pies.

1364
01:44:52,724 --> 01:44:55,193
I've been wanting to talk to you
all night.

1365
01:44:55,352 --> 01:44:57,320
Minny said why you won't be my friend.

1366
01:44:57,479 --> 01:44:59,732
It's 'cause you think me and Johnny
went behind your back.

1367
01:45:01,399 --> 01:45:03,322
Wait. I want to talk...

1368
01:45:03,485 --> 01:45:04,862
Oh, no.

1369
01:45:05,028 --> 01:45:06,701
I'm so sorry.

1370
01:45:09,908 --> 01:45:11,660
Come here, sweetheart.

1371
01:45:11,827 --> 01:45:13,579
Let me bring you back to your table.

1372
01:45:16,039 --> 01:45:18,508
- I'm really sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.

1373
01:45:19,793 --> 01:45:23,388
What are you trying to do to me?
What are you and that nigra up to?

1374
01:45:23,547 --> 01:45:25,220
I don't know what you're talking about.

1375
01:45:25,382 --> 01:45:26,929
You liar! Who did you tell?

1376
01:45:27,092 --> 01:45:29,389
Hilly, I got pregnant
after you and Johnny broke up!

1377
01:45:29,552 --> 01:45:32,226
- Oh, shit!
- Shut up, Mother!

1378
01:45:32,388 --> 01:45:35,813
Johnny never cheated on you.

1379
01:45:36,725 --> 01:45:38,227
At least not with me.

1380
01:45:38,394 --> 01:45:41,773
Oh, Johnny would never cheat on me.

1381
01:45:41,939 --> 01:45:45,318
I'm so sorry! I thought you'd be tickled
you won that pie!

1382
01:45:46,193 --> 01:45:50,573
You tell that nigra, if she tells
anybody, I will make her suffer!

1383
01:45:50,739 --> 01:45:53,037
Hey, that is enough.

1384
01:45:53,617 --> 01:45:54,618
Celia.

1385
01:45:54,785 --> 01:45:56,287
Hey, baby, what's the matter?

1386
01:45:56,453 --> 01:45:59,047
- Oh!
- Cel?

1387
01:46:00,082 --> 01:46:01,083
Oh!

1388
01:46:02,710 --> 01:46:06,010
Oh, shit. What a mess. Napkins.

1389
01:46:07,506 --> 01:46:10,179
Why don't we get back to the auction?

1390
01:46:10,341 --> 01:46:13,265
- Next up, Debby's peppermint bark.
- Celia!

1391
01:46:13,845 --> 01:46:15,893
It goes great with hot cocoa.

1392
01:46:21,769 --> 01:46:23,988
Oh, just come on home with us
tonight, Mother.

1393
01:46:24,147 --> 01:46:27,401
No, thanks. I've got a pie to eat.

1394
01:46:27,567 --> 01:46:29,990
You throw that pie away right now.

1395
01:46:30,153 --> 01:46:32,281
I spent good money on this pie.

1396
01:46:33,197 --> 01:46:34,995
I won it just for you.

1397
01:46:35,158 --> 01:46:37,286
You signed me up?

1398
01:46:37,452 --> 01:46:41,502
I may have trouble remembering my own
name, or what country I live in,

1399
01:46:41,664 --> 01:46:44,087
but there are two things
I can't seem to forget:

1400
01:46:44,250 --> 01:46:47,800
that my own daughter
threw me into a nursing home,

1401
01:46:47,962 --> 01:46:49,964
and that she ate Minny's shit.

1402
01:46:51,048 --> 01:46:52,220
Good night.

1403
01:46:56,428 --> 01:46:59,898
- Hey, how about a nightcap?
- Let's go.

1404
01:47:07,022 --> 01:47:10,196
I'm not right for this
kind of life, Minny.

1405
01:47:12,069 --> 01:47:15,243
I don't need a dining room table
for 12 people.

1406
01:47:16,073 --> 01:47:19,452
I couldn't get two people
over here if I begged.

1407
01:47:23,747 --> 01:47:26,091
I can't do this to Johnny any more.

1408
01:47:28,502 --> 01:47:30,800
That's why I've gotta go back
to Sugar Ditch.

1409
01:47:32,505 --> 01:47:34,724
You can't move back to Sugar Ditch.

1410
01:47:36,968 --> 01:47:39,016
Lord.

1411
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:41,977
I reckon it's time you knew.

1412
01:47:42,139 --> 01:47:43,311
Sit down.

1413
01:47:54,026 --> 01:47:57,075
So Miss Hilly thought you knew about
the terrible awful.

1414
01:47:58,364 --> 01:48:00,366
That you was making fun of her.

1415
01:48:03,369 --> 01:48:05,918
It's my fault she pounced on you.

1416
01:48:08,416 --> 01:48:10,418
If you leave Mr. Johnny...

1417
01:48:12,752 --> 01:48:15,847
...then Miss Hilly done won
the whole ball game.

1418
01:48:18,008 --> 01:48:19,851
Then she done beaten me...

1419
01:48:21,261 --> 01:48:23,355
...and she done beat you.

1420
01:48:30,395 --> 01:48:32,944
Thank you for telling me that.

1421
01:48:40,447 --> 01:48:44,077
Lord, look at all these pages. 266.

1422
01:48:44,534 --> 01:48:46,411
Mm-mm!

1423
01:48:47,662 --> 01:48:50,541
So we just send it off?
Just wait and see?

1424
01:48:50,707 --> 01:48:52,425
Hope Miss Stein gonna publish it?

1425
01:48:52,584 --> 01:48:56,713
Well, I have one more story to type
before I put it in the mail,

1426
01:48:56,879 --> 01:48:58,381
but other than that, we're done.

1427
01:48:58,547 --> 01:49:00,140
Which one you got left?

1428
01:49:02,634 --> 01:49:03,806
Uh, mine.

1429
01:49:14,438 --> 01:49:16,907
I need to talk to you about Constantine.

1430
01:49:17,399 --> 01:49:21,404
Oh, Eugenia, that was so long ago.

1431
01:49:21,945 --> 01:49:23,117
What happened?

1432
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:25,658
Oh.

1433
01:49:26,450 --> 01:49:28,293
What happened?

1434
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:35,167
She didn't give me a choice.

1435
01:49:40,296 --> 01:49:45,223
The Daughters of America had just
appointed me state regent.

1436
01:49:48,012 --> 01:49:51,357
Grace Higginbotham, our esteemed
president, came all the way down

1437
01:49:51,516 --> 01:49:55,487
from Washington, D.C.,
to our house for the ceremony.

1438
01:49:57,105 --> 01:50:01,110
That's just beautiful. Look at that.

1439
01:50:04,612 --> 01:50:08,333
She'd gotten so old and slow, Skeeter.

1440
01:50:12,036 --> 01:50:13,253
Yes, ma'am.

1441
01:50:15,914 --> 01:50:19,339
It's such an honor
that you came all this way.

1442
01:50:28,051 --> 01:50:29,098
That's all right.

1443
01:50:33,932 --> 01:50:36,606
- Hello, Miss Charlotte.
- Rachel.

1444
01:50:38,645 --> 01:50:40,773
We were expecting you next week.

1445
01:50:40,939 --> 01:50:42,737
I decided to come early
and surprise Mama.

1446
01:50:42,899 --> 01:50:44,822
Oh.

1447
01:50:45,861 --> 01:50:47,238
I'm entertaining.

1448
01:50:47,404 --> 01:50:49,782
Why don't you go around back.
Wait in the kitchen.

1449
01:50:55,453 --> 01:50:56,749
Go on now.

1450
01:50:59,915 --> 01:51:01,417
I am sorry.

1451
01:51:04,378 --> 01:51:07,006
Rachel, what are you doing?

1452
01:51:07,173 --> 01:51:10,427
I'm just doing as I was told,
Miss Charlotte.

1453
01:51:10,593 --> 01:51:12,095
Going to the kitchen.

1454
01:51:12,261 --> 01:51:14,355
But I'm going to see my mama first.

1455
01:51:15,806 --> 01:51:18,559
Hello, Mama.

1456
01:51:18,726 --> 01:51:21,445
Go on to the kitchen, baby.
I'll be there directly.

1457
01:51:21,604 --> 01:51:25,780
You may put up with this kind
of nonsense, but I do not.

1458
01:51:32,489 --> 01:51:34,036
Get out of this house, Rachel.

1459
01:51:38,161 --> 01:51:40,539
You heard her. Go on, girl.

1460
01:51:40,705 --> 01:51:44,835
Miss Charlotte, let me take her to
the kitchen. Come on, baby. Let's go.

1461
01:51:46,711 --> 01:51:48,133
Charlotte.

1462
01:51:52,550 --> 01:51:54,473
Both of you.

1463
01:51:54,636 --> 01:51:57,264
Leave. Now.

1464
01:52:01,434 --> 01:52:02,777
Come on, Mama.

1465
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:36,847
Come on now.

1466
01:52:50,482 --> 01:52:52,985
Constantine didn't do anything wrong.

1467
01:52:54,695 --> 01:52:56,618
And you love Rachel. I know you do.

1468
01:52:56,780 --> 01:52:59,953
She was our president.
What was I supposed to do?

1469
01:53:00,950 --> 01:53:05,296
She did you the biggest favor of
your life. She taught me everything.

1470
01:53:05,454 --> 01:53:08,628
Well, you idolized her too much.
You always have.

1471
01:53:08,791 --> 01:53:10,919
I needed someone to look up to.

1472
01:53:14,338 --> 01:53:15,715
Well, I...

1473
01:53:16,549 --> 01:53:20,224
I went to her house the next day,
but she had already gone.

1474
01:53:50,957 --> 01:53:52,504
How could you not tell me all this?

1475
01:53:52,667 --> 01:53:56,171
Because I didn't want to upset you
during your final exams.

1476
01:53:56,338 --> 01:53:59,057
I knew you'd blame me,
and it wasn't my fault!

1477
01:53:59,215 --> 01:54:00,808
I have to go find her. She needs me.

1478
01:54:00,967 --> 01:54:02,264
- Eugenia.
- What?

1479
01:54:04,179 --> 01:54:07,649
We sent your brother up to Chicago
to bring Constantine home.

1480
01:54:16,566 --> 01:54:17,988
When he got there...

1481
01:54:22,071 --> 01:54:23,618
...she had died.

1482
01:54:39,755 --> 01:54:41,849
You broke her heart.

1483
01:54:47,429 --> 01:54:52,356
I'm...
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

1484
01:54:55,437 --> 01:54:57,064
I'm sorry.

1485
01:55:52,868 --> 01:55:54,836
They printed a few thousand copies

1486
01:55:54,995 --> 01:55:58,340
with the worst advance Miss Stein
had ever seen.

1487
01:55:58,498 --> 01:56:01,126
Baby, what you doing with Alicia book?
You can't read.

1488
01:56:02,210 --> 01:56:07,558
They sent Miss Skeeter $600. She broke
that money up and gave it to each of us.

1489
01:56:08,383 --> 01:56:13,310
Divided 13 ways,
that came to about $46 each.

1490
01:56:19,394 --> 01:56:20,737
Y'all finish your homework.

1491
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:28,494
Aibileen. Aibileen!

1492
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:31,994
We just got this from Miss Skeeter.
Look at it.

1493
01:56:32,156 --> 01:56:33,703
Look at it.

1494
01:56:33,866 --> 01:56:35,584
Look at it!

1495
01:56:35,743 --> 01:56:37,711
Minny, we're rich!

1496
01:56:39,622 --> 01:56:43,092
"She fired me
for using her inside toilet.

1497
01:56:43,250 --> 01:56:48,006
Put me out in a storm and told me never
to come back. But I did come back.

1498
01:56:48,172 --> 01:56:52,348
I came back with a pie I had baked
to say I'm sorry.

1499
01:56:53,385 --> 01:56:54,728
I watched her eat... "

1500
01:57:05,105 --> 01:57:07,277
Well, it's a wonderful book, Hilly.

1501
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:11,365
Filled with gripping testimonials
from Mississippi's housekeepers.

1502
01:57:12,195 --> 01:57:14,038
OK, Mama. I need to run.

1503
01:57:14,197 --> 01:57:18,998
Well. You should read the book, Hilly.
It's quite scandalous.

1504
01:57:19,160 --> 01:57:22,755
Sounds like... Jackson, if you ask me.

1505
01:57:23,248 --> 01:57:24,591
Quite scandalous.

1506
01:57:25,917 --> 01:57:27,169
What book?

1507
01:57:27,335 --> 01:57:28,552
What's it called again?

1508
01:57:28,795 --> 01:57:29,796
Uh...

1509
01:57:30,129 --> 01:57:32,848
The Help. H-E-L-P.

1510
01:58:00,617 --> 01:58:01,960
There it is.

1511
01:58:10,294 --> 01:58:11,762
You told me to write something good.

1512
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:14,093
- Something I believed in.
- It's not what I believe in.

1513
01:58:14,256 --> 01:58:17,100
That joke you pulled with Hilly
with the toilets, that's funny.

1514
01:58:18,635 --> 01:58:20,603
Why would you do this to us?

1515
01:58:21,597 --> 01:58:23,190
I don't even know why you care.

1516
01:58:23,348 --> 01:58:26,192
- What?
- Things are fine around here.

1517
01:58:26,351 --> 01:58:27,772
Why go stir up trouble?

1518
01:58:27,935 --> 01:58:30,313
Trouble's already here, Stuart.

1519
01:58:30,479 --> 01:58:32,447
I had to tell you this.
You needed to know.

1520
01:58:32,607 --> 01:58:35,486
Goddamn right I needed to know. You
should have told me this from the start.

1521
01:58:40,281 --> 01:58:41,908
You're a selfish woman, Skeeter.

1522
01:58:43,784 --> 01:58:44,831
Stuart.

1523
01:58:44,994 --> 01:58:47,122
I think you're better off being alone.

1524
01:59:35,293 --> 01:59:36,840
Yeah.

1525
01:59:37,003 --> 01:59:39,756
Did you get to that part yet
that I was telling you about?

1526
01:59:39,923 --> 01:59:41,800
Don't read ahead, whatever you do.

1527
01:59:41,966 --> 01:59:44,264
"What you done put up in this?"

1528
01:59:44,427 --> 01:59:47,806
"She Said, 'My Shit. "'

1529
02:00:02,695 --> 02:00:04,242
What's the matter, Hilly?

1530
02:00:05,739 --> 02:00:09,494
- Get off of me! Get off!
- Ouch! Stop hitting me!

1531
02:00:11,620 --> 02:00:14,248
I heard that Betty character
might be Mary Elizabeth.

1532
02:00:14,415 --> 02:00:16,793
It's not Jackson.

1533
02:00:16,959 --> 02:00:21,339
And that book is garbage. I bet the
whole thing is made up by some nigra.

1534
02:00:21,505 --> 02:00:23,428
And Jolene, didn't your mama

1535
02:00:23,590 --> 02:00:25,592
leave Cora to you in her will?

1536
02:00:25,759 --> 02:00:29,684
Yes, but that's not odd, is it?
Happens all the time, right?

1537
02:00:29,847 --> 02:00:32,565
The book is not about Jackson.

1538
02:01:57,473 --> 02:01:58,975
What the hell?

1539
02:02:00,309 --> 02:02:01,811
What are you doing here?

1540
02:02:03,687 --> 02:02:05,940
I've contacted my lawyer.

1541
02:02:06,106 --> 02:02:08,734
Hibbie Goodman? He's the best
libel attorney in the state.

1542
02:02:08,901 --> 02:02:10,528
Oh, Missy, you're going to jail.

1543
02:02:10,694 --> 02:02:12,446
You can't prove anything.

1544
02:02:12,613 --> 02:02:15,958
Oh, I 100 percent know you wrote it.
Nobody else in town is as tacky as you.

1545
02:02:16,116 --> 02:02:17,993
You don't know anything, Hilly.

1546
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:19,662
Oh, I don't, do I?

1547
02:02:20,329 --> 02:02:23,378
You tell Aibileen the next time
she wants to write

1548
02:02:23,541 --> 02:02:26,420
about my dear friend Elizabeth...

1549
02:02:26,585 --> 02:02:30,510
Uh-huh.
Remember her? Had you in her wedding.

1550
02:02:30,673 --> 02:02:33,892
Let's just say Aibileen ought to have
been a little bit smarter

1551
02:02:34,050 --> 02:02:36,724
before putting in about that
L- shaped scratch

1552
02:02:36,886 --> 02:02:39,560
in poor Elizabeth's dining table.

1553
02:02:41,641 --> 02:02:45,441
And that nigger Minny,
do I have plans for her.

1554
02:02:46,104 --> 02:02:50,905
Careful, Hilly. That's chapter 12.

1555
02:02:51,067 --> 02:02:53,240
Don't give yourself away now.

1556
02:02:53,695 --> 02:02:55,322
That was not me!

1557
02:02:56,239 --> 02:02:58,412
I've come to tell your mother
what a hippie you've become.

1558
02:02:58,575 --> 02:03:00,623
She's going to be disgusted by you.

1559
02:03:00,785 --> 02:03:04,415
Why, Hilly. Is everything OK, you two?

1560
02:03:04,581 --> 02:03:05,582
Oh, Mrs. Phelan.

1561
02:03:05,748 --> 02:03:09,628
Hilly, you're a sweaty mess.
Are you ill?

1562
02:03:10,503 --> 02:03:11,504
No, ma'am.

1563
02:03:11,671 --> 02:03:16,642
Darling, oh, no husband wants
to come home and see that.

1564
02:03:16,967 --> 02:03:18,594
Oh.

1565
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:20,228
I didn't have time to get fixed up.

1566
02:03:20,387 --> 02:03:22,355
You know, Hilly, if I didn't
know any better,

1567
02:03:22,514 --> 02:03:26,189
I'd say you've been eating too much pie.

1568
02:03:30,647 --> 02:03:33,947
Mrs. Phelan, I came here...

1569
02:03:34,109 --> 02:03:36,612
In fact, I'm sure of it.

1570
02:03:36,778 --> 02:03:38,997
Now you get your raggedy ass
off my porch.

1571
02:03:39,656 --> 02:03:41,533
Go on.

1572
02:03:41,700 --> 02:03:44,795
Get off my property. Now!

1573
02:03:45,871 --> 02:03:49,125
Before we all get one of those
disgusting things on our lips!

1574
02:04:04,472 --> 02:04:07,726
Eugenia. Take me inside, please.

1575
02:04:08,851 --> 02:04:09,852
Yes, ma'am.

1576
02:04:25,493 --> 02:04:28,497
Skeeter, do you have plans tomorrow?

1577
02:04:29,205 --> 02:04:30,832
- No, ma'am.
- Good.

1578
02:04:32,541 --> 02:04:35,044
Because we are going shopping.

1579
02:04:36,962 --> 02:04:39,431
No single daughter of mine is
going to New York City

1580
02:04:39,589 --> 02:04:41,182
representing the great state
of Mississippi

1581
02:04:41,341 --> 02:04:43,764
without a proper cosmopolitan wardrobe.

1582
02:04:43,927 --> 02:04:45,304
How do you know about New York?

1583
02:04:45,470 --> 02:04:48,269
Oh, well, Miss Stein called last night.

1584
02:04:55,981 --> 02:04:58,905
Courage sometimes skips a generation.

1585
02:05:01,861 --> 02:05:04,660
Thank you for bringing it back
to our family.

1586
02:05:13,957 --> 02:05:16,085
I can't leave you like this.

1587
02:05:16,584 --> 02:05:19,712
Eugenia, I have made a decision.

1588
02:05:19,878 --> 02:05:22,347
My health's been on the uptick
these last few weeks,

1589
02:05:22,506 --> 02:05:25,680
and I know the doctor says it's
some kind of last strength nonsense,

1590
02:05:25,843 --> 02:05:30,269
but I have decided not to die.

1591
02:05:35,769 --> 02:05:36,941
Oh, Mama.

1592
02:05:37,104 --> 02:05:38,822
It's too late.
I tried calling Fanny Mae's

1593
02:05:38,981 --> 02:05:41,234
to make all your hair appointments
for the next 20 years,

1594
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:43,823
but they wouldn't allow it.

1595
02:05:46,113 --> 02:05:50,584
I have never been more proud of you.

1596
02:05:55,497 --> 02:05:57,215
Thank you.

1597
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:07,217
Mama.

1598
02:06:35,411 --> 02:06:36,913
Need some help with those?

1599
02:06:39,082 --> 02:06:40,298
Minny.

1600
02:06:40,457 --> 02:06:42,334
- Miss Celia!
- Minny, hey, stop! Minny!

1601
02:06:42,501 --> 02:06:44,128
- Miss Celia!
- Minny!

1602
02:06:44,294 --> 02:06:48,174
- Stay back!
- I'm not here to hurt you! Girl...

1603
02:06:50,092 --> 02:06:51,765
You gonna put the stick down?

1604
02:06:51,927 --> 02:06:53,645
Uh-uh.

1605
02:06:56,306 --> 02:06:59,856
Listen, Celia finally told me
about the babies.

1606
02:07:01,061 --> 02:07:02,404
All of them.

1607
02:07:04,189 --> 02:07:07,864
But I also know, the minute
you started working here,

1608
02:07:08,026 --> 02:07:09,869
she started getting better.

1609
02:07:10,987 --> 02:07:12,830
So, you saved her life.

1610
02:07:16,284 --> 02:07:19,003
You knew I was here the whole time?

1611
02:07:19,162 --> 02:07:22,461
Fried chicken and okra
on the first night?

1612
02:07:23,666 --> 02:07:26,169
Y'all could have at least put
some cornpone on the table.

1613
02:07:28,879 --> 02:07:30,051
No.

1614
02:07:31,715 --> 02:07:34,059
I couldn't let you eat no more cornpone,
Mr. Johnny.

1615
02:07:34,218 --> 02:07:37,062
Thanks to you, now I've had to let out
every pair of pants I own.

1616
02:07:45,062 --> 02:07:47,406
You just leave that.

1617
02:07:48,065 --> 02:07:49,408
Here you go.

1618
02:07:50,401 --> 02:07:52,074
Let's head on up the house.

1619
02:08:16,759 --> 02:08:17,851
What's this?

1620
02:08:18,720 --> 02:08:20,393
I cooked it all by myself.

1621
02:08:20,555 --> 02:08:23,149
Yes, she did.
She was up all night.

1622
02:08:24,767 --> 02:08:26,861
I wanted to do something special.

1623
02:08:28,104 --> 02:08:30,232
I wanted to say thank you.

1624
02:08:33,401 --> 02:08:34,402
So...

1625
02:08:35,445 --> 02:08:37,038
...I ain't losing my job?

1626
02:08:39,032 --> 02:08:42,707
No, you got a job here
for the rest of your life.

1627
02:08:42,869 --> 02:08:44,085
If you want it.

1628
02:08:50,459 --> 02:08:52,553
That's a mile-high meringue, Miss Celia.

1629
02:09:02,012 --> 02:09:04,265
- Please.
- Thank you.

1630
02:09:08,268 --> 02:09:10,191
Ooh.

1631
02:09:10,354 --> 02:09:11,822
You remember to check the thighs?

1632
02:09:11,980 --> 02:09:15,575
- Mm-hm. Cooked clean through.
- Ain't pink in the middle?

1633
02:09:15,734 --> 02:09:18,908
Uh-uh. Just the way you taught me.

1634
02:09:19,071 --> 02:09:20,948
Looky here.

1635
02:09:24,784 --> 02:09:27,788
That table of food
gave Minny the strength she needed.

1636
02:09:28,871 --> 02:09:33,468
She took her babies out from under Leroy
and never went back.

1637
02:09:38,005 --> 02:09:40,633
What are all these cars
doing out here? Are we late?

1638
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:42,143
No, we ain't late.

1639
02:09:43,761 --> 02:09:44,808
Why ain't you singing?

1640
02:09:44,971 --> 02:09:47,099
We got to worry about getting
in there and getting our seats.

1641
02:09:47,265 --> 02:09:48,482
Come on now, we late!

1642
02:09:57,441 --> 02:10:00,741
- Who we clapping for?
- Honey, we clapping for you!

1643
02:10:04,282 --> 02:10:05,999
Come on down, Sister Clark!

1644
02:10:06,908 --> 02:10:08,080
Come on.

1645
02:10:26,261 --> 02:10:27,683
Come on.

1646
02:10:30,473 --> 02:10:31,816
All right, all right.

1647
02:10:33,435 --> 02:10:38,612
Now, uh... this is an important time
in our community.

1648
02:10:39,399 --> 02:10:43,654
And we have to thank you
for what you have done.

1649
02:10:46,031 --> 02:10:47,156
Now...

1650
02:10:48,282 --> 02:10:50,910
We know you couldn't put
your name in here,

1651
02:10:52,328 --> 02:10:54,046
so we all signed our own.

1652
02:10:56,457 --> 02:10:57,549
Thank you.

1653
02:10:59,877 --> 02:11:03,677
Come on, now. Come on.

1654
02:11:41,250 --> 02:11:45,130
Churches over two counties
signed our books. All for you and me.

1655
02:11:49,133 --> 02:11:50,476
It's beautiful.

1656
02:11:53,805 --> 02:11:54,931
What's wrong?

1657
02:12:01,145 --> 02:12:03,614
I got a job offer from Harper and Row
in New York.

1658
02:12:04,232 --> 02:12:06,030
Congratulations!

1659
02:12:06,192 --> 02:12:09,786
- I'm not taking it.
- What you mean you're not taking it?

1660
02:12:09,945 --> 02:12:11,572
I can't just leave you two here

1661
02:12:11,738 --> 02:12:14,161
when things are getting bad
from the mess that I created.

1662
02:12:14,324 --> 02:12:19,080
No. If bad things happen,
ain't nothing you can do about it.

1663
02:12:19,246 --> 02:12:21,624
And now it's for a reason
we can be proud of.

1664
02:12:23,875 --> 02:12:25,877
I don't mean to rub salt in your wound,

1665
02:12:26,044 --> 02:12:28,513
but you ain't got a good life here
in Jackson.

1666
02:12:28,672 --> 02:12:30,140
Plus, your mama's getting better.

1667
02:12:30,298 --> 02:12:33,677
You ain't got nothing left here
but enemies in the Junior League.

1668
02:12:33,844 --> 02:12:35,767
You done burned every bridge there is.

1669
02:12:35,929 --> 02:12:38,398
And you ain't never gonna
get another man in this town.

1670
02:12:38,557 --> 02:12:40,776
Everybody know that.

1671
02:12:40,934 --> 02:12:44,359
So don't walk your white butt
to New York, run it!

1672
02:12:46,356 --> 02:12:50,030
Looky here, Miss Skeeter.
I'm gonna take care of Aibileen.

1673
02:12:52,194 --> 02:12:53,992
And she's gonna take care of me.

1674
02:13:05,749 --> 02:13:08,218
Go find your life, Miss Skeeter.

1675
02:13:21,807 --> 02:13:24,185
Aibileen, can you come in here, please?

1676
02:13:30,315 --> 02:13:31,362
Good morning.

1677
02:13:32,108 --> 02:13:36,989
Aibileen, the silver
I lent Elizabeth last week.

1678
02:13:37,155 --> 02:13:39,249
It not polished good?

1679
02:13:39,407 --> 02:13:42,661
Humidity been fighting me
on polishing day.

1680
02:13:42,827 --> 02:13:47,503
When you returned it, three pieces
were missing from the felt wrapper.

1681
02:13:48,833 --> 02:13:52,087
A fork and two spoons.

1682
02:13:52,253 --> 02:13:55,803
Let me... Let me go check in the
kitchen. Maybe I left some behind.

1683
02:13:55,965 --> 02:13:59,014
You know as well as I do that silver's
not in the kitchen.

1684
02:14:01,346 --> 02:14:03,599
You check in Mae Mobley's bed?

1685
02:14:04,724 --> 02:14:06,818
Since the Lil Man was born,
she been putting things...

1686
02:14:06,976 --> 02:14:08,728
Do you hear her, Elizabeth?

1687
02:14:09,771 --> 02:14:11,568
She's trying to blame it on a toddler.

1688
02:14:13,732 --> 02:14:15,405
I ain't got no silver.

1689
02:14:15,567 --> 02:14:17,661
She says she doesn't have them.

1690
02:14:18,153 --> 02:14:22,408
Then it behooves me to inform you
that you are Tired, Aibileen.

1691
02:14:23,534 --> 02:14:25,707
And I'll be calling the police.

1692
02:14:27,621 --> 02:14:30,420
Aibee, my throat hurts.

1693
02:14:32,584 --> 02:14:35,303
I'll go get some syrup, Miss Leefolt.

1694
02:14:36,004 --> 02:14:38,507
Elizabeth can take care
of her own children.

1695
02:14:41,927 --> 02:14:44,771
- I'll go get the cough syrup.
- Come here, Lil Man.

1696
02:14:44,930 --> 02:14:46,352
I'm OK.

1697
02:14:56,732 --> 02:14:58,780
I didn't steal no silver.

1698
02:14:58,943 --> 02:15:02,664
Maybe I can't send you to jail
for what you wrote,

1699
02:15:02,822 --> 02:15:04,699
but I can send you for being a thief.

1700
02:15:04,865 --> 02:15:07,288
I know something about you.
Don't you forget that.

1701
02:15:07,994 --> 02:15:11,123
From what Yule Mae says, there's a lot
of time to write letters in jail.

1702
02:15:11,289 --> 02:15:14,964
Plenty of time to write the truth
about you. And the paper is free.

1703
02:15:15,126 --> 02:15:17,800
- Nobody will believe what you wrote!
- I don't know!

1704
02:15:18,337 --> 02:15:21,637
I been told I'm a pretty good writer.
Already sold a lot of books.

1705
02:15:26,387 --> 02:15:28,560
Call the police, Elizabeth.

1706
02:15:29,307 --> 02:15:32,026
All you do is scare and lie
to try to get what you want.

1707
02:15:32,184 --> 02:15:33,185
Aibileen, stop!

1708
02:15:33,352 --> 02:15:35,399
You a godless woman.

1709
02:15:37,439 --> 02:15:39,533
Ain't you tired, Miss Hilly?

1710
02:15:42,193 --> 02:15:43,536
Ain't you tired?

1711
02:15:56,958 --> 02:15:59,381
Aibileen, you have to go now.

1712
02:16:14,017 --> 02:16:16,439
Don't go, Aibee.

1713
02:16:17,645 --> 02:16:19,989
Baby, you need to get back to bed.

1714
02:16:20,522 --> 02:16:24,572
- Please don't leave.
- I gots to, baby. I am so sorry.

1715
02:16:24,735 --> 02:16:27,488
Are you going to take care
of another little girl?

1716
02:16:27,655 --> 02:16:29,623
No, that's not the reason.

1717
02:16:29,782 --> 02:16:33,332
I don't want to leave you,
but it's time for me to retire.

1718
02:16:33,494 --> 02:16:35,747
- You're my last little girl.
- No!

1719
02:16:35,913 --> 02:16:37,915
Baby. Baby.

1720
02:16:38,916 --> 02:16:41,419
I need you to remember everything
I told you, OK?

1721
02:16:41,585 --> 02:16:43,713
- OK.
- You remember what I told you?

1722
02:16:43,879 --> 02:16:49,306
You is kind. You is smart.

1723
02:16:49,468 --> 02:16:51,141
You is important.

1724
02:16:51,303 --> 02:16:53,180
That's right, Baby Girl.

1725
02:16:58,393 --> 02:16:59,861
Don't go, Aibee.

1726
02:17:00,019 --> 02:17:01,236
I gots to, baby.

1727
02:17:03,898 --> 02:17:05,821
You give my sweet girl a chance.

1728
02:17:22,125 --> 02:17:24,378
Mae Mobley was my last baby.

1729
02:17:26,838 --> 02:17:29,717
In just ten minutes,
the only life I knew was done.

1730
02:17:29,882 --> 02:17:32,601
Aibee!

1731
02:17:35,972 --> 02:17:38,065
God says we need to love our enemies.

1732
02:17:38,223 --> 02:17:39,566
No!

1733
02:17:41,476 --> 02:17:42,819
It hard to do.

1734
02:17:49,067 --> 02:17:51,195
But it can start by telling the truth.

1735
02:17:56,366 --> 02:17:59,961
No one had ever asked me
what it felt like to be me.

1736
02:18:03,331 --> 02:18:05,379
Once I told the truth about that...

1737
02:18:07,377 --> 02:18:09,050
...I felt free.

1738
02:18:17,471 --> 02:18:20,565
And I got to thinking
about all the people I know.

1739
02:18:22,600 --> 02:18:24,602
And the things I seen and done.

1740
02:18:30,357 --> 02:18:34,703
My boy, Treelore, always said we going
to have a writer in the family one day.

1741
02:18:38,032 --> 02:18:40,160
I guess it's gonna be me.

1742
02:18:41,305 --> 02:18:47,823
