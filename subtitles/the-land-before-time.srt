Once upon this same earth,

4
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,360
beneath this same sun,

5
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,200
long before you...

6
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,120
before the ape
and the elephant as well,

7
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,960
before the wolf,
the bison, the whale,

8
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,320
before the mammoth
and the mastodon

9
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,280
in the time
of the dinosaurs.

10
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,080
Come on!

11
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,480
Dinosaurs
were of two kinds...

12
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,280
Some had flat teeth
and ate the leaves of trees.

13
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,640
Some had sharp teeth
for eating meat.

14
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,520
They preyed upon
the leaf-eaters.

15
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,880
Then leaves began to die.

16
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,720
The mighty beasts,
who appeared to rule earth,

17
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,080
were ruled, in truth,
by the leaf.

18
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,520
Desperate for food,

19
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,720
some dinosaur herds
struck out toward the west,

20
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,160
some dinosaur herds
struck out toward the west,

21
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,680
searching for
their Great Valley,

22
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,560
a land still lush and green.

23
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,520
It was a journey toward life.

24
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,960
It was a march of many dangers.

25
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,880
Sharpteeth stalked the herds,

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,760
waiting to seize
any who strayed.

27
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,160
The leaf-eaters stopped only
to hatch their young.

All that remained
of his herd

63

was his mother,

65
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,840

by scent and by their love.

67
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,080
He knew they would
be together always.

00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,440
Now, you be careful,
my Littlefoot.

I'm sorry, my dear.

75
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,080
The land has been changing.

That is why we must walk
as far as we can each day

until we reach the Great Valley.

more than you could ever eat

than you could ever drink.

176
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,720
Ohh! Sharptooth!

177
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,480
Help!

178
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,280
Mother! Help!

179
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,760
[Grrr]

180
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,200
[Grrr]

181
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,240
[Grrr]

182
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,040
Go.

183
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,040
This way.

184
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,000
Mm-mmm.

185
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,440
Come back.
You're going the wrong way!

186
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,320
Aah!

187
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,800
Whoa!

188
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,760
Ohh!

00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,400

Mother?

197
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,640
Run!

198
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,320
Look out!

199
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,120
Aah!

200
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,360
Ohh!

201
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,880
Oh!

202
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,640
- Help!

00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,920
[Grrr]

204
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,480

[Grrr]

206
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,040

Aah!

211
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,000
In this time
of the clash of continents,

212
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,400
an earthquake split the land.

213
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,240
Herds were divided,
families were cut in two.

214
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,200
Littlefoot was separated
from his grandparents.

215
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,200
Cera!

216
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,640
Mama! Daddy!

217
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,400
Cera was on one side
of the divide,

218
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,360
her parents
were on the other.

219
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,640
Mother!

220
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,440
Mother!

221
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,080
Uh!

222
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,640
Mother?

223
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,720
Where are you?

224
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,840
Oh.

225
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,840
Mother.

226
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,680
Mother?

227
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,640
Oh.

228
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,880
Please get up.

229
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,120
I'm...

230
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,640
not sure I can, Littlefoot.

231
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,080
Yes, you can.

232
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,640
Get up.

233
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,640
Dear, sweet Littlefoot,

234
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,880
do you remember the way
to the Great Valley?

235
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,320
I guess so,

236
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,280
but why do I have to know?

237
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,960
You're going to be with me.

238
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,880
I'll be with you,

239
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,760
even if you can't see me.

240
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,080
What do you mean
if I can't see you?

241
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,480
I can always see you.

242
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,040
Littlefoot,
let your heart guide you.

243
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,800
It whispers.

244
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,320
So listen closely.

245
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,400
Mother? Mother?

246
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,520
Mmm.

247
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,680
Mmmmm.

248
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,960
Hey!

249
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,400
What's going on here?

250
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,560
[Crying]

251
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,560
What's your problem?

252
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,080
You're not hurt.

253
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,120
It's not fair.

254
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,320
She should have known better.

255
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,720
That was a sharptooth.

256
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,640
It's all her fault.

257
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,640
All whose fault?

258
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,680
Mother's.

259
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,480
Oh...

260
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,520
I see. I see.

261
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,240
Why did I wander
so far from home?

262
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,640
Oh, it's not your fault.

263
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,040
It's not your mother's fault.

264
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,120
You pay attention to old Rooter.

265
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,200
It is nobody's fault.

266
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,520
The great circle
of life has begun,

267
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,960
but, you see,

268
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,280
not all of us arrive
together at the end.

269
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,720
What'll I do?

270
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,120
I miss her so much.

271
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,160
You'll always miss her,

272
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,920
but she'll always be with you

273
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,360
if you remember
what she taught you.

274
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,680
You'll never really be apart,

275
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,520
for you're still
a part of each other.

276
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,160
My tummy hurts.

277
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,760
Well, that, too,
will go in time, little fella...

278
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,280
only in time.

Littlefoot could only
think about his mother.

288
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,160
He hardly noticed his hunger

289
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,600
and forgot that he must
reach the Great Valley.

Dear Littlefoot,

296
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,920
do you remember the way
to the Great Valley?

297
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,160
Follow the bright circle

298
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:29,040
past the great rock
that looks like a long-neck

299
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,920
and past the mountains
that burn.

300
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,840
I'll be in your heart,
Littlefoot.

301
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,800
Let your heart guide you.

303
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,400

00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Mother!

305
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,200
Hee hee hee!

Mother!

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,280
Heh heh! It's you!

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,240
Wait!

310
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,160
Then Littlefoot
knew for certain

311
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,160
that he was alone

312
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,040
and that though
the Great Valley

313
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,480
was far away

314
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,400
and the journey perilous,

315
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,800
he'd have to find his way,

316
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,640
or the chain of life
would be broken.

Nothing. Where are you going?

I'm going to find my own kind.

They're on the other side.

323

You can't climb
up the other side.

324
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,880
Maybe you can't.

325
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,840
Uhh!

Uhh!

I'm going to the Great Valley.

328
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,080
We could... help each other.

329
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,520
Ha! A three-horn...

Uhh!

331
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,920

W-well, at least
we wouldn't be alone.

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,960
Well, when I find my sisters,

336

I won't be alone,

337
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,640
so go away.

338

Three-horns can
be very dangerous.

339
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,480
They only talk with
other three-horns,

with other three-horns.

Are you not scared? Huh?

[Yawn]

525
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,520
We're going
to the Great Valley.

526
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,400
You could go with us. Yes.

527
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,800
Uh, you are a spiketail,

528
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,760
so we will call you Spike.

Ducky!

530
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,640
So the five
hungry dinosaurs

531
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,040
left for the Great Valley.

532
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,400
There had never been
such a herd...

A long-neck, a three-horn,

a bigmouth,
a flier, and a spiketail,

535
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,480
All knowing that
if they lost their way,

536
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,920
they would starve

537
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,360
or find themselves
in sharptooth's shadow.

538
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,480
Hmm. Tree stars grow

539
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,880
where there's lots of water.

540
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,680

they were close.

with us anyway.

Come on.

695
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,200
Cera's way is easier.

696
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,880
I think so, too.

697
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,320
Oh, Flathead, wait!

698
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,200
Ooh! Aah! Ow!

699
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,560
No be angry.

700
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,720
Wait!

701
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,120
Cera, wait for us!

702
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,600
We're coming with you, Cera!

703
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,640
Cera, Spike, wait!

704
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,320
I wish Littlefoot
was here with us now.

705
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,000
Me, too.

706
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,120
Spike.

707
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,480
Spike, do not stop.

708
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,680
We must stay together.

709
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,280

Help, Cera!

715
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,840
Cera, where are you?

Hang on! I'm coming!

Quick, this way!

00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,720
Hang on, Petrie!

Oh, Petrie am so happy.

Get away from me!

Help!

743
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,960
Petrie, Spike, Ducky, help!

744
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,040

00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:09,560
I knew it was you
all along. I did!

Oh, get out of my way.

Cera, come back!

00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,560
Come back!

752
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:41,400
Cera was still too proud
to admit that...

753
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,960
she'd gone the wrong way.

Sharptooth!

758
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,480
It's sharptooth.

759
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,240
Let's get rid of him for good.

760
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,400
We'll coax him to deep water.

761
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,480
He can't swim
with scrawny arms.

762
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:42,080
Me and Spike will push
that rock on his head.

763
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,480
He'll fall into the water.

764
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,880
Petrie, whistle when he's
where the water gets dark.

765
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,280
Now we need some bait.

Hmm.

I tried to do
what you told me,

but it's just too hard.

was all they dreamed
it would be...

A land of green,
leaves and life.

There were waterfalls,
grassy meadows,

enough tree stars
to feast on forever

found his grandmother
and grandfather at last...

01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,400
If we hold on

870
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:50,080
Together

871
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,440
I know our dreams

872
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,000
Will never die

873
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,560
Dreams see us through

874
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:03,120
To forever

875
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:09,760
Where clouds roll by

876
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:16,160
For you and I

877
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:20,400
When we are out there

878
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,800
In the dark

879
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:28,720
We'll dream about the sun

880
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,280
In the dark

881
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:36,320
We'll feel the light

882
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,360
Warm our hearts

883
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:45,040
Every one

884
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,440
If we hold on

885
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,280
Together

886
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:57,520
I know our dreams will never die

887
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:03,360
Dreams see us through to forever

888
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:09,000
As high as souls can fly

889
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:13,040
The clouds roll by

890
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:24,080
or you and I
