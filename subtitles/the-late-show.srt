2
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,685
Mr. Wells?

3
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:01,242
Mr. Wells?

4
00:02:02,563 --> 00:02:05,665
- Yes, Mrs. Schmidt?
- You've got company, Mr. Wells.

5
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,743
That's some bender you've been on, pal.

6
00:02:25,847 --> 00:02:30,258
They're gonna have to put a night shift
on Jack Daniel's just to keep up with you.

7
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:38,558
Mrs. Schmidt, call the police. 485-2581.

8
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:43,396
Tell them to get an ambulance here fast.
Tell them we got a dying man.

9
00:02:52,113 --> 00:02:53,740
Police emergency?

10
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:59,746
Can you send an ambulance?
We've got a man here. I think he's dying.

11
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:03,249
The address is 1405 Beechwood.

12
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:06,294
It's not as bad as the time in San Diego.

13
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:10,256
Ira, I got a deal for us.

14
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,383
Harry, who did it?

15
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:15,803
It's a chance for us to make a lot of dough.

16
00:03:16,137 --> 00:03:18,723
Harry, you're dying. Tell me who did it.

17
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,236
How did it happen?

18
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,730
Don't worry, Ira, I'm cutting you in.
Fair deal.

19
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:31,444
Just don't try to throw a scare into me.
It won't work.

20
00:03:33,154 --> 00:03:35,281
I'll lay it all out for you.

21
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:39,285
Just get me to a hospital.

22
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,342
God damn you, Harry!

23
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,765
Letting somebody walk up
and drill you like that...

24
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:02,767
point-blank.

25
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:07,230
Nobody can palm a.45.

26
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,443
Jesus Christ.

27
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:16,489
You never had the brains
God gave a common dog.

28
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,453
Sorry you're going off, pal.

29
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,586
You were real good company.

30
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:35,925
The best.

31
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:49,480
The very best.

32
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,968
Margo, that's him.

33
00:05:19,427 --> 00:05:22,128
Jeez, Charles,
he doesn't look so hot to me.

34
00:05:22,232 --> 00:05:26,100
Let me tell you, kiddo,
Ira Wells used to be one of the greats.

35
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,898
Whatever it is, Charlie, the answer is no.

36
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:35,015
What do you mean no?
Did I say a word? Did I?

37
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,277
- No.
- Yeah.

38
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:38,363
Ira, Margo. Margo, Ira.

39
00:05:38,696 --> 00:05:40,584
- Mr. Wells...
- Margo here's a pal of mine.

40
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:43,534
How do you feel about cats?

41
00:05:44,118 --> 00:05:46,590
- I beg your pardon?
- Cats. How do you feel about them?

42
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:48,164
I'm not sure.

43
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:51,219
What I mean is that
somebody stole Winston.

44
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:54,045
- Somebody stole who?
- Winston, my cat.

45
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,537
Somebody stole him.
I have a picture of him.

46
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:59,498
- What the hell is she talking about?
- I wanna show it to you.

47
00:05:59,603 --> 00:06:00,937
See, Brian stole Winston.

48
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:04,232
And he said he would strangle him
if I don't pay him the money.

49
00:06:04,336 --> 00:06:06,735
Margo owes this guy $500 for a long time.

50
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:09,425
Come on, Charles,
six months is hardly a long time.

51
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:10,676
He gets PO'd at her...

52
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,242
and steals the cat and threatens to kill it
if she doesn't give the dough.

53
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:16,307
- So pay him.
- I can't pay him.

54
00:06:16,411 --> 00:06:18,288
I don't have the money to pay him.

55
00:06:18,392 --> 00:06:22,699
I see. You want me to find the guy
that stole your cat and bring it back, right?

56
00:06:22,824 --> 00:06:24,356
- Thanks, pal.
- He's easy to identify.

57
00:06:24,461 --> 00:06:26,859
I can't help you out.
Try the fire department.

58
00:06:26,963 --> 00:06:29,862
- I'm out of the business.
- His collar is...

59
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:32,531
Come on, this is the kind of play
you can handle easy.

60
00:06:32,636 --> 00:06:34,909
Mr. Wells, if it's money...

61
00:06:35,013 --> 00:06:38,423
I had planned to offer you $25.
I have it right here.

62
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:42,510
- Charlie, how long have I known you?
- I don't know, 16, 17 years.

63
00:06:43,344 --> 00:06:46,942
In all that time, did you
ever hear of Ira Wells taking a two-bit job?

64
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:48,891
I heard what you said.

65
00:06:50,184 --> 00:06:52,186
This is not a two-bit job.

66
00:06:53,855 --> 00:06:57,452
I mean, if I offended you,
I'm very sorry, and I apologize...

67
00:06:57,556 --> 00:07:00,820
because I didn't mean to offend
the great Ira Wells.

68
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:05,533
Charlie, I want you to know
I appreciate you coming to Harry's funeral.

69
00:07:06,534 --> 00:07:08,453
I enjoy talking to you.

70
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,831
Maybe I don't act like it, but I do.

71
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:15,168
There aren't many guys left
from the old days.

72
00:07:16,377 --> 00:07:20,590
I think you ought to teach your pal here
some respect for her elders.

73
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:25,793
Yeah, well,
maybe you should learn a little respect...

74
00:07:25,897 --> 00:07:29,057
for other little creatures
that are walking under your...

75
00:07:29,557 --> 00:07:32,977
- Where are you headed?
- I'm going to the track, Hollywood Park.

76
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:37,899
This little kitty is just a little honey bun!

77
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:41,444
Give this little cat a break!

78
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,697
<i>It's Bank Vault going away</i>
<i>by a length-and-a-half.</i>

79
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:58,617
<i>Wild Chase is second by four lengths.</i>
<i>Easy Victor, on the inside, is third.</i>

80
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:00,682
<i>Kewpie Doll and Top Target are tied.</i>

81
00:08:00,786 --> 00:08:04,373
<i>The rest of the field is well back. Down</i>
<i>the course Bank Vault pulls away.</i>

82
00:08:04,477 --> 00:08:05,791
<i>Wild Chase is leading.</i>

83
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:08,805
<i>Easy Victor and Kewpie Doll</i>
<i>unable to close any ground.</i>

84
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:17,980
<i>... and Kewpie Doll is the fourth horse.</i>

85
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:21,891
<i>Timing the race for six furlongs,</i>
<i>covering three-quarters of a mile...</i>

86
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:25,519
<i>one minute, ten seconds flat.</i>
<i>In the winner's circle is Bank Vault...</i>

87
00:08:25,624 --> 00:08:29,210
<i>with Hollywood Park's leading apprentice</i>
<i>jockey, Benny de Angelino...</i>

88
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:31,254
<i>getting his fifth in the current leading.</i>

89
00:08:31,358 --> 00:08:34,111
<i>And for those looking for a hot bet</i>
<i>on Friday the 13th...</i>

90
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:37,917
<i>this might have been the horse</i>
<i>they were looking for luck on the 13th.</i>

91
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:50,555
All right, Charlie, give out with it.

92
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:53,974
I thought you was going to the track.

93
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:57,884
How long has it been
since I've seen you, Charlie?

94
00:08:57,988 --> 00:08:59,980
Close to a year, isn't it?

95
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:04,401
Somebody puts the freeze
on Harry Regan...

96
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:08,416
next thing I know, you show up
at Harry's funeral with some dolly...

97
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:12,493
and a song and dance about a stolen cat,
and all that hot comedy.

98
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:16,289
What's it all got to do with Harry?

99
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,576
Harry was working for the dolly.

100
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:26,247
Are you telling me that Harry
got himself killed on account of some cat?

101
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:27,508
Listen.

102
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,763
I know Margo maybe six or seven years.

103
00:09:32,847 --> 00:09:34,547
Used to be a client of mine.

104
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:39,312
One night, a couple of weeks ago, she
comes into this bar where I'm working...

105
00:09:40,438 --> 00:09:43,514
Just sort of temporary.
The talent business is slow.

106
00:09:43,618 --> 00:09:48,102
Anyway, it turns out that she's mad as hell
about this guy stealing her cat.

107
00:09:48,206 --> 00:09:49,530
I'm listening...

108
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:53,023
and all of a sudden
I remember Harry Regan.

109
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:56,287
And I think to myself,
"He's still in the business...

110
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:59,540
"if there's any business left for him to do."

111
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,835
He took the job.

112
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:08,038
So he finds this guy that stole the cat
and starts to follow him.

113
00:10:08,143 --> 00:10:10,916
- Yeah.
- Who is this guy Harry was tailing?

114
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:13,888
I wouldn't know him
from a hole in my sock.

115
00:10:14,263 --> 00:10:15,515
The dolly?

116
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:21,521
- The dolly? What about her?
- Where does she live, Charlie?

117
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:25,400
Some place called La Paloma...

118
00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:28,945
over on Franklin, near Vermont.

119
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:33,366
That's where you live, isn't it, Charlie?

120
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,243
Yeah.

121
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:51,384
<i>As we begin to meditate...</i>

122
00:10:52,093 --> 00:10:53,970
<i>take a deep breath.</i>

123
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,755
Charlotte, listen to me.
Tonight is important.

124
00:10:57,859 --> 00:10:59,965
I don't want you to get uptight about it.

125
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,698
Because this guy books
a lot of Holiday Inns all over the country.

126
00:11:03,803 --> 00:11:05,429
I think it's a good place to start.

127
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:08,516
I mean, it's a good place to work out
a lot of problems.

128
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,727
You're gonna be absolutely terrific tonight.
Who's taking you?

129
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:14,532
- What's he gonna wear?
<i>- Imagine the joy...</i>

130
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:18,536
Wait. I'll tell you what.
I think he should wait outside.

131
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,861
No, because that's very important.

132
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:24,959
I'm telling you, the entire picture,
the entire impression, is important.

133
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:30,496
Charlotte, this is another
self-destructive act, in my opinion.

134
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,499
Listen, if I am gonna handle your career...

135
00:11:33,603 --> 00:11:36,043
and if I am going to be...
Wait a second, Charlotte.

136
00:11:36,147 --> 00:11:39,932
Charlotte, listen, I got to go.
No. Somebody just walked in.

137
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,353
I'll see you at 10:30.
You're gonna be terrific.

138
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,938
Think positive. Okay, bye-bye.

139
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:50,307
Why don't you just come in
and make yourself comfortable?

140
00:11:50,412 --> 00:11:55,156
<i>... descending into the boundless water...</i>

141
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:58,618
<i>as it rises over...</i>

142
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,913
<i>your tired, weary body.</i>

143
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,750
<i>You begin to relax.</i>

144
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:09,201
Harry Regan was a pal of mine
close to 24 years.

145
00:12:09,306 --> 00:12:12,840
Whoever it was that killed him
is gonna be goddamn sorry.

146
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,969
Mr. Wells, I can understand
your feeling that way.

147
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:20,723
I mean, as an actress,
I understand it as a motivation.

148
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:25,478
- What about this guy who took your cat?
- Brian Hemphill.

149
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,650
He's this guy, he's really sort of a tuna.
He just hangs around, you know.

150
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:35,738
And we used to have this thing going,
kind of a sexual interlude.

151
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,700
It never really came to anything.

152
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:42,193
Now Brian and his friend
sometimes give me money...

153
00:12:42,297 --> 00:12:45,206
to schlep things to this guy in Bakersfield.

154
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,710
- Things? What things?
- You know, things.

155
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:52,296
Material things.
I mean, worldly possessions:

156
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,801
Washing machines, TV sets,
clock radios. Things.

157
00:12:56,926 --> 00:13:00,252
Did it ever cross your mind
these things might be hot?

158
00:13:00,357 --> 00:13:04,225
Who's to know? I mean,
I'm not by nature a curious person.

159
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,674
I'll bet.

160
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:09,105
- I mean, go with the flow.
- That's what I always say.

161
00:13:10,064 --> 00:13:12,723
This guy in Bakersfield,
he paid you off in cash, right?

162
00:13:12,827 --> 00:13:13,849
Yes.

163
00:13:13,954 --> 00:13:17,603
Then you'd bring the dough to this punk,
Brian, then you'd get your cut?

164
00:13:17,707 --> 00:13:18,750
Yes.

165
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:22,525
Only on this last trip, you decided you
wanna keep the money yourself, right?

166
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:26,153
So Brian gets mad because
he wants his dough. So he steals your cat.

167
00:13:26,258 --> 00:13:28,823
- And you go crying to Harry Regan.
- It was just a loan.

168
00:13:28,927 --> 00:13:33,755
I did not take the money, it was a loan,
just till I get my dress business going.

169
00:13:34,505 --> 00:13:38,134
- Your dress business?
- I design all the clothes I make.

170
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:43,462
- I thought you were an actress.
- Are you kidding? I did the whole star trip.

171
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:46,173
I just never could learn
how to push myself, you know.

172
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:50,063
I don't like to go begging.
I don't want anybody to do me any favors.

173
00:13:50,271 --> 00:13:53,775
I just never could learn
how to play the Hollywood game.

174
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:57,487
My shrink says
that I'm a very conflicted personality.

175
00:13:57,653 --> 00:13:59,614
- Jesus Christ.
- But my astrologist...

176
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,574
What is that supposed to mean?

177
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:04,879
Back in the '40s, this town was crawling
with dollies like you.

178
00:14:04,984 --> 00:14:08,279
Good-looking cokeheads trying
their damnedest to act tough as hell.

179
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,417
I got news for you:
They did it better back then.

180
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:15,171
This town doesn't change.
They just push the names around.

181
00:14:16,297 --> 00:14:19,967
Same dames,
screwing up their lives just the same way.

182
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:25,337
All right. What about this guy Brian?
Where can I find him?

183
00:14:25,442 --> 00:14:27,767
Who's to know. He just hangs around.

184
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:31,343
- Where is around?
- Around is around.

185
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:33,888
I mean, around is no particular place.

186
00:14:33,992 --> 00:14:37,892
The only time I hear from him is when he
calls me up to torment me about my cat.

187
00:14:37,996 --> 00:14:40,978
The next time he calls you up,
I want you to set up a meet.

188
00:14:41,082 --> 00:14:42,365
All right.

189
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:47,495
Mr. Wells, listen,
I don't want you to get the wrong idea...

190
00:14:47,912 --> 00:14:52,667
- about me schlepping those things...
- Doll, I'm not interested in your life story.

191
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,753
Just set up a meet with your friend Brian.

192
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:05,555
Yes? I'm coming.

193
00:15:06,431 --> 00:15:07,765
Just a minute.

194
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,258
I don't care what you say, you understand?

195
00:15:11,363 --> 00:15:13,844
- Yes?
- Hi, I'm Margo Sperling.

196
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:16,357
We'd like to talk to your husband.

197
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,152
No, my husband passed on
seven years ago.

198
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,237
What's going on in here?

199
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:25,272
We were playing canasta
right there in the living room.

200
00:15:25,377 --> 00:15:27,358
Kid, the you-know-what has hit the fan.

201
00:15:27,462 --> 00:15:30,694
Look, I wouldn't make a federal case
out of everything, Charlie.

202
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,406
Mrs. Schmidt, would you leave us alone
for a couple of minutes?

203
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:38,546
I have some personal business
to talk over with these people.

204
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,287
Of course, Mr. Wells.

205
00:15:40,392 --> 00:15:43,509
- It was very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

206
00:15:43,718 --> 00:15:47,180
Anytime, Mr. Wells,
your friends are more than welcome.

207
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:50,641
- Thank you.
- I like the color of your sweater.

208
00:15:51,768 --> 00:15:53,853
- Thank you.
- Very much.

209
00:15:57,732 --> 00:16:00,933
- The man's a killer, you ding-a-ling!
- Don't call me a ding-a-ling!

210
00:16:01,037 --> 00:16:02,111
Hold it!

211
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:04,666
This happens to be where I live, okay?

212
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:08,482
It may not look like a hell of a lot to you,
but it suits me.

213
00:16:08,587 --> 00:16:11,819
Now, Mrs. Schmidt, that's my landlady,
we get along just fine.

214
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:15,239
At least we did until a few days ago.
If you two would simmer down...

215
00:16:15,343 --> 00:16:17,220
tell me what's going on, I'd appreciate it.

216
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:19,910
Okay. You wanted to take
a meeting with Brian, right?

217
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:21,579
So he called me.

218
00:16:21,683 --> 00:16:24,853
I'm listening to him carefully
because I've known him a long time.

219
00:16:24,957 --> 00:16:28,043
And Brian's not very evolved.
In fact, he's rather de-evolved.

220
00:16:28,148 --> 00:16:31,797
I was talking to him, and I'm very sensitive
to the vibrations he gives out.

221
00:16:31,901 --> 00:16:33,591
Because I know what karma he has...

222
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:37,011
- What is she talking about?
- She said you was looking for this guy...

223
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:40,201
- because of what happened to Harry.
- That's what I said.

224
00:16:40,306 --> 00:16:42,892
She said if he didn't come here
you'd come gunning for him.

225
00:16:42,996 --> 00:16:46,041
- That's right.
- The punk that nailed Harry's coming here?

226
00:16:46,145 --> 00:16:48,731
Wait a second. You are so paranoid.

227
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:52,912
You don't know for sure.
You don't know that that's true at all!

228
00:16:53,788 --> 00:16:57,417
- Maybe Brian didn't even do it.
- I got a pretty good idea.

229
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:02,755
Charlie may be a chiseler and a crook,
but he's the best information man in town.

230
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:09,595
Wait a second. What is that for?

231
00:17:11,472 --> 00:17:13,474
It's for if Charlie's right.

232
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:15,685
Please. Come on. No, don't do this.

233
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,283
Do you know people who play with guns
are generally impotent?

234
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:22,400
What's ever settled with a gun?

235
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,394
Come on, hold on a second.
Now, just a second.

236
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:30,106
How many people you're gonna shoot?
Hold on a second.

237
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,952
I think it's him. It's him.

238
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:36,070
Mrs. Schmidt...

239
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:39,073
I'll use the living room
for a few minutes, if you don't mind.

240
00:17:39,177 --> 00:17:41,659
That's fine, Mr. Wells.
Just don't make a mess.

241
00:17:41,763 --> 00:17:44,839
Come on, lighten up
on this cops and robbers stuff.

242
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:49,469
I can handle this.

243
00:17:51,261 --> 00:17:52,388
Christ!

244
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:54,389
Watch it!

245
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:53,105
He's getting away. Don't let him!

246
00:18:53,209 --> 00:18:54,607
- Take it easy.
- Go, get him.

247
00:18:54,711 --> 00:18:55,900
- Are you crazy?
- Plug him!

248
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:58,006
God damn it! Kill him! You could get him!

249
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,457
I could get a heart attack,
that's what I could get...

250
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,532
running all that way.

251
00:19:03,637 --> 00:19:07,088
How far do you think I'd get
with this leg of mine? That's one.

252
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:12,218
Two: Whoever that guy is,
he's no snob about how he kills people.

253
00:19:12,927 --> 00:19:15,138
It's a goddamn.45 he's using.

254
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:23,688
There are a lot of ways to play any game.
I play mine on the house percentages.

255
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:36,117
485-2581, Mr. Wells. I remembered.

256
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,995
Thank you very much, Mrs. Schmidt.

257
00:19:39,537 --> 00:19:42,332
- I'm sorry about all this.
- It's no bother.

258
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,172
Where's my cat, you creep?

259
00:19:52,342 --> 00:19:55,678
Come on in, doll, before you catch a cold.

260
00:20:15,406 --> 00:20:17,825
All right, Charlie, hand it over.

261
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,455
What do you mean?

262
00:20:23,998 --> 00:20:26,334
Whatever you took off the stiff.

263
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:29,671
Hand it over.

264
00:20:31,172 --> 00:20:34,050
Jesus, kid,
I always said you were the best.

265
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:37,387
Didn't I tell you he was the best?

266
00:20:44,018 --> 00:20:45,395
What's that?

267
00:20:49,607 --> 00:20:50,775
Stamps?

268
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,026
- The Whiting job.
- Who? Whiting?

269
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,236
About 10 days ago,
some place out in the Valley.

270
00:21:04,341 --> 00:21:05,404
Whiting? Who's that?

271
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:07,948
Whiting had a stamp collection
worth almost $50,000.

272
00:21:08,053 --> 00:21:10,972
- Who's Whiting?
- There's a murder one tied to it, right?

273
00:21:11,076 --> 00:21:13,631
Okay, don't tell me. What do I care?

274
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,249
Two guys broke into a house
out in the Valley.

275
00:21:17,354 --> 00:21:20,649
They tied up Whiting and his wife,
and started to lift the stamps.

276
00:21:20,753 --> 00:21:22,692
Then something must have gone wrong...

277
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:24,986
because they beat up Whiting
and killed his wife.

278
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:26,801
Disgusting. I don't wanna hear any more.

279
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:29,491
- That's what Harry was onto, right?
- I don't know.

280
00:21:29,595 --> 00:21:30,721
I don't wanna hear any more.

281
00:21:30,825 --> 00:21:33,015
Harry knew about the stamps
and he also told you.

282
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:35,309
That's why you knew
what to look for on the punk.

283
00:21:35,413 --> 00:21:38,104
Kid, I swear he didn't tell me anything.

284
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:42,160
Hear that? That's the cops.
They'll be here in a couple minutes.

285
00:21:42,785 --> 00:21:47,373
Either you start to play it on the square
with me, or I'll feed you to them.

286
00:21:47,582 --> 00:21:51,210
- Which, considering your record...
- You wouldn't do that.

287
00:21:54,297 --> 00:21:56,549
Okay, here's the house number.

288
00:22:01,095 --> 00:22:05,308
Harry is tailing this guy, Brian,
looking for Margo's cat...

289
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:10,021
when Brian and this pal of his
pull off the Whiting heist.

290
00:22:10,772 --> 00:22:13,514
The next day, Harry met me
and laid out the whole thing.

291
00:22:13,618 --> 00:22:17,028
Wants me to check out the reward angle.
I nose around.

292
00:22:17,487 --> 00:22:22,241
Sure enough, Continental Insurance is
offering $15,000 for the goddamn stamps.

293
00:22:23,284 --> 00:22:25,453
You guys were gonna split it.

294
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:30,833
Just the kind of cheap grift
Harry would go for.

295
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:02,813
Listen, Charlotte,
I'm having a lot of trouble.

296
00:23:02,918 --> 00:23:06,869
- I had a lot of big trouble...
- Kid, you know who just kicked off?

297
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:11,624
That dame,
the one that almost nailed you back in '53.

298
00:23:13,418 --> 00:23:15,420
Jesus, what was her name?

299
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:19,298
- Madeline? No. Marilyn Thornton.
- That's her.

300
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,262
- I'm still carrying some of that lead.
- I'll talk to you later.

301
00:23:26,055 --> 00:23:30,018
Pit city. I mean, pit city!

302
00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:34,564
Not only did I still not get my cat back,
thanks to you...

303
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:38,224
not only did I
almost get mowed down here tonight...

304
00:23:38,328 --> 00:23:40,810
not only did I sit here with yellow socks...

305
00:23:40,914 --> 00:23:44,834
and perjure myself in front of the entire
Los Angeles Police Department...

306
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:47,483
on top of that,
I promised a singer that I manage...

307
00:23:47,587 --> 00:23:49,902
I would be there
for a very important audition.

308
00:23:50,006 --> 00:23:52,613
And of course, you can probably tell,
I'm not there.

309
00:23:52,717 --> 00:23:55,209
And on top of that, I got my period.

310
00:23:57,211 --> 00:24:00,340
Listen, doll, let's get something straight.

311
00:24:00,923 --> 00:24:03,165
As long as we're gonna be
working together...

312
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,678
try to act like a lady, will you?

313
00:24:06,554 --> 00:24:08,848
Who says we're working together?

314
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:13,592
Do you have any ideas
about who might have wanted to kill him?

315
00:24:13,697 --> 00:24:15,094
No, I don't.

316
00:24:15,198 --> 00:24:18,639
What about the guy that helped
your boyfriend pull off the Whiting heist?

317
00:24:18,743 --> 00:24:19,828
Ray Escobar.

318
00:24:19,932 --> 00:24:21,809
Mr. Wells, a truly evolved person...

319
00:24:21,913 --> 00:24:25,865
doesn't go around ratting on her friends,
if you catch my drift.

320
00:24:26,574 --> 00:24:27,857
This guy, Escobar, who is he?

321
00:24:27,961 --> 00:24:30,067
There is no point in this discussion.

322
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:32,987
If you only knew how far behind
I've gotten in everything...

323
00:24:33,091 --> 00:24:36,949
just because of all this ridiculous...
And I don't even have my cat yet!

324
00:24:37,053 --> 00:24:39,493
I don't wanna even talk about it,
because I'm finished.

325
00:24:39,598 --> 00:24:42,048
I mean, I am finished. <i>Finalissimo!</i>

326
00:24:44,467 --> 00:24:45,510
Kid.

327
00:24:48,346 --> 00:24:49,962
Let me talk to Margo alone.

328
00:24:50,066 --> 00:24:53,048
I don't wanna be talked to alone,
or talked to in a crowd.

329
00:24:53,153 --> 00:24:56,062
I don't wanna be talked to by you, Charles.

330
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:01,859
- Just hear me out, okay?
- Please!

331
00:25:02,193 --> 00:25:03,976
- Look, sugar.
- I'm not listening.

332
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,312
You're two payments
behind on the car, right?

333
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:09,523
I know, because you already tried
to hit me up for loan.

334
00:25:09,628 --> 00:25:12,495
What do you think you owe the dentist
for your caps?

335
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,206
<i>- Om.</i>
- Okay.

336
00:25:18,459 --> 00:25:22,880
What about that trip to Vegas? How much
do you think you're in hock for that?

337
00:25:23,715 --> 00:25:26,134
And what about the Japanese lessons?

338
00:25:27,468 --> 00:25:31,014
Let's see. How much do you figure
that's all totaled up to...

339
00:25:31,848 --> 00:25:34,215
at least $4,000?

340
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,353
Now can you think about $15,000
in reward money...

341
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:40,773
strictly on the up and up, split two ways.

342
00:25:43,985 --> 00:25:45,028
Well?

343
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:53,119
Boy, it's really lucky for you that I just
happen to be a self-destructive person.

344
00:25:53,911 --> 00:25:54,954
Okay.

345
00:25:57,415 --> 00:26:00,126
Start talking from the top.

346
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:05,214
Okay, as long as
we're gonna be working together.

347
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:10,814
Brian had this creepy friend.

348
00:26:10,918 --> 00:26:13,921
Far be it for me to go around
passing judgments on people...

349
00:26:14,025 --> 00:26:16,559
but Ray Escobar is truly Pittsville.

350
00:26:16,684 --> 00:26:20,594
They had some kind of arrangement,
a deal going with this guy named Birdwell.

351
00:26:20,699 --> 00:26:22,565
- Ronny Birdwell?
- Yeah.

352
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:26,788
He's a fence. New since your day.
Got a setup over on Sunset place.

353
00:26:26,892 --> 00:26:31,147
Check around the street, Charlie.
See what you can pick up on Escobar.

354
00:26:31,251 --> 00:26:33,826
- Can do.
- That's it?

355
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,737
Charles, wait!
Give me a lift out to the airport.

356
00:26:38,842 --> 00:26:41,501
Jesus, Margo! It's 2:00 in the morning!

357
00:26:41,751 --> 00:26:45,838
- Okay, so I'll buy gas.
- One more thing, doll, about my fee.

358
00:26:47,965 --> 00:26:49,175
My fee.

359
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:53,930
- I get $25 a day plus expenses.
- What's he talking about?

360
00:26:54,639 --> 00:26:58,320
Listen, sweetheart, you're talking
to Ira Wells, not some low-rent gumshoe.

361
00:26:58,424 --> 00:27:02,271
- I'm the best, and I get paid like the best.
- All right.

362
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:06,067
Okay.

363
00:28:16,637 --> 00:28:17,633
Birdwell?

364
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:20,933
No. I work for Mr. Birdwell.
My name is Jeff Lamar.

365
00:28:21,142 --> 00:28:23,936
- Won't you come in, Mr. Wells?
- Thank you.

366
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:57,011
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

367
00:29:00,056 --> 00:29:01,933
No hard feelings, sir.

368
00:29:04,018 --> 00:29:05,311
I know that.

369
00:29:19,701 --> 00:29:20,952
Come on.

370
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:45,184
This is Mr. Wells.

371
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:07,373
You said on the phone you had something
I might be interested in.

372
00:30:08,082 --> 00:30:11,586
Before we do any talking,
better warn this cheesehead.

373
00:30:12,587 --> 00:30:15,757
Next time he tries anything with me,
I'll kill him.

374
00:30:16,257 --> 00:30:19,093
I won't give him a chance. I'll kill him.

375
00:30:20,094 --> 00:30:21,346
Okay, pop.

376
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,516
Now that you've got that off your chest,
what's your business?

377
00:30:25,725 --> 00:30:27,352
The Whiting job.

378
00:30:27,935 --> 00:30:30,469
- Postage stamps, right?
- That's right.

379
00:30:30,573 --> 00:30:34,525
- What's that got to do with me?
- The word is, it could be tied in to you.

380
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:38,602
I'm gonna tell you I don't know
dick about the Whiting job, right?

381
00:30:38,707 --> 00:30:41,105
You'll tell me
you'll take this hotshit information...

382
00:30:41,209 --> 00:30:43,201
of yours to somebody else.

383
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:46,548
Then I'll tell you I'd be interested
if the price is right.

384
00:30:46,652 --> 00:30:50,917
Then we'll dance for a couple of hours.
So let's just cut to the chase.

385
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:52,710
You like music?

386
00:30:53,044 --> 00:30:57,037
I got a Panasonic hi-fi over there
that is a sensation to the ears.

387
00:30:57,142 --> 00:31:00,583
Automatic record changer, air suspension,
plus an eight-track tape.

388
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:04,920
Last week a pal of mine was tailing one
of the guys that pulled the Whiting job.

389
00:31:05,025 --> 00:31:06,724
He turned up dead.

390
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,593
I'll throw in a couple of suits.
Manufacturers' name brands.

391
00:31:10,697 --> 00:31:13,554
Hart Shafner and Marx,
Botany 500, Petrocelli. What do you say?

392
00:31:13,658 --> 00:31:14,941
Bullshit!

393
00:31:15,483 --> 00:31:19,612
His name was Harry Regan.
I mean to have the louse that nailed him.

394
00:31:19,737 --> 00:31:21,604
I never heard of any guy named Regan.

395
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:24,023
I'll tell you, pop,
I'm in a kind of line of work...

396
00:31:24,127 --> 00:31:26,942
- that you pick up things, you know?
- I can see that.

397
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:30,362
It could be I have some information
about your buddy.

398
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:33,741
Come on, Ronny.
How do you know he really has anything...

399
00:31:33,845 --> 00:31:37,453
- and isn't just jerking you around?
- You know something, punk?

400
00:31:37,557 --> 00:31:41,092
If he was to finger you,
I'd give him a Petrocelli suit.

401
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:45,179
Stamps are a specialty item.
Not just anybody can move them.

402
00:31:45,513 --> 00:31:49,976
When a guy pulls a heist like that,
he's got the fence lined up in front.

403
00:31:50,226 --> 00:31:53,312
- So far, I couldn't give less of a shit.
- Maybe.

404
00:31:53,855 --> 00:31:57,473
But one of the punks
that pulled the Whiting job works for you.

405
00:31:57,577 --> 00:31:59,110
Brian Hemphill.

406
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:02,447
You are peddling Brian Hemphill.

407
00:32:07,035 --> 00:32:10,111
I know the son of a bitch
pulled the Whiting robbery.

408
00:32:10,215 --> 00:32:12,457
You know who told me? The cops.

409
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:16,461
Yeah. I was down
at the station house already.

410
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:20,506
Two hours, they kept me there.
They ran my ass ragged.

411
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:26,012
I told them the same thing I'll tell you.
I fired Hemphill two months ago.

412
00:32:27,221 --> 00:32:31,340
He was a thief, he was robbing me blind.
I haven't seen the little turd since.

413
00:32:31,444 --> 00:32:34,468
I'll tell you something else.
They know he was shot last night.

414
00:32:34,572 --> 00:32:36,939
They're looking for a pal of his.

415
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,737
You're a little late, pop. About 40 years.

416
00:32:48,076 --> 00:32:49,369
Come here.

417
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:56,250
I like you.

418
00:33:03,341 --> 00:33:07,731
I admire a guy your age that's got the balls
to try a hustle like that.

419
00:33:07,835 --> 00:33:10,139
Right, Lamar? What's your size?

420
00:33:11,015 --> 00:33:13,382
- What?
- In the collar and sleeve?

421
00:33:13,486 --> 00:33:17,636
I got a shipment of Van Heusen shirts
yesterday that will knock your eyes out.

422
00:33:17,741 --> 00:33:19,847
On account of what Lamar did to you.

423
00:33:19,951 --> 00:33:23,736
You're a 17-34. Something else.

424
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:28,981
The police know
that Brian Hemphill is an alias.

425
00:33:29,085 --> 00:33:31,786
His real name is Earl Hampton.

426
00:33:31,953 --> 00:33:35,123
He did time in Illinois
for robbing a jewelry store.

427
00:33:36,124 --> 00:33:38,876
This is you. It's perfect.

428
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:42,088
You wear that, you'll drive the girls crazy.

429
00:33:43,506 --> 00:33:44,841
Okay, pop?

430
00:33:49,178 --> 00:33:50,763
No hard feelings.

431
00:33:57,937 --> 00:34:00,857
Must be around here somewhere.
There he is. Ira.

432
00:34:02,316 --> 00:34:03,724
Where are you headed?

433
00:34:03,828 --> 00:34:07,228
I'm on my way to the Brown Derby
to meet Louis B. Mayer.

434
00:34:07,332 --> 00:34:09,021
Where does it look like I'm headed?

435
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:12,108
Where were you all morning?
I must have called you 20 times.

436
00:34:12,212 --> 00:34:15,653
- I went to see Birdwell.
- What did you wanna do that for?

437
00:34:15,757 --> 00:34:18,948
Trying to figure out why two guys
who heist $50,000 in stamps...

438
00:34:19,052 --> 00:34:22,076
are still hanging around town,
waiting for the cops to wise up...

439
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,452
and grab them on murder rap.

440
00:34:23,556 --> 00:34:27,748
I could have told you that.
Because they are dumb. They're D-U-M-B.

441
00:34:27,852 --> 00:34:30,928
- I'll remember you said that.
- How'd it go?

442
00:34:32,055 --> 00:34:34,265
With Birdwell? Piece of cake.

443
00:34:35,683 --> 00:34:39,854
Didn't I say he was the greatest?
Didn't I say that before? Damn.

444
00:34:39,979 --> 00:34:42,357
Wait a minute!

445
00:34:43,274 --> 00:34:45,860
Come on, start this thing. Mr. Wells!

446
00:34:49,155 --> 00:34:50,615
Wait a second!

447
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,204
For crying out loud, don't tell me
how to drive when I'm driving!

448
00:34:56,871 --> 00:35:00,500
This car is not only a toilet,
but you are the attendant.

449
00:35:06,297 --> 00:35:07,715
There he is.

450
00:35:19,852 --> 00:35:22,772
Did you dig up anything
on this guy Escobar?

451
00:35:25,024 --> 00:35:26,818
But it's gonna cost.

452
00:35:27,819 --> 00:35:28,861
Yeah?

453
00:35:29,487 --> 00:35:31,395
I found a guy who knows another guy...

454
00:35:31,499 --> 00:35:34,669
that saw Escobar holed up
someplace over in Santa Monica.

455
00:35:34,774 --> 00:35:38,703
- That's the part that costs.
- He wants a C-note for the address.

456
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,416
You got that kind of dough?

457
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:45,003
- What about you?
- $46. That's all I've got.

458
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:51,259
It might interest you to know that I dug up
a few items about your pal Brian today.

459
00:35:52,093 --> 00:35:54,189
Such as, his real name is Earl Hampton.

460
00:35:54,293 --> 00:35:57,525
Did a stretch in the pen
a couple of years back for armed robbery.

461
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,642
His name was Earl Hampton.

462
00:36:00,768 --> 00:36:05,021
$68, but that's every penny.
I'm not kidding. I mean, every penny.

463
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:09,474
Birdwell tried to put some muscle on me
and I had to get tough with him.

464
00:36:09,578 --> 00:36:13,448
He's starting to crack,
but it's not Christmas yet, understand?

465
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:19,870
- You shouldn't put that in first.
- I beg your pardon.

466
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:23,405
If you still wanna cash in
on the reward money, I got to move.

467
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,251
I got to move fast.

468
00:36:25,752 --> 00:36:28,744
How come I'm the one
that has to raise the money?

469
00:36:28,848 --> 00:36:32,091
How come nobody else here
in this group has any cash?

470
00:36:32,467 --> 00:36:34,208
What's wrong with you, Charles?

471
00:36:34,312 --> 00:36:38,431
Why don't you try to come up
with a little scratch once in a while?

472
00:36:38,556 --> 00:36:40,808
You two have a real class act.

473
00:36:42,643 --> 00:36:47,065
Charlie, take a couple of hours
and dig up anything you can on Birdwell.

474
00:36:47,982 --> 00:36:50,412
- There's something screwy going on there.
- Got you.

475
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:53,404
I'll tell you what you do.
Call up Tom Wyman.

476
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:56,105
He works out of
the Bureau of Detectives, downtown.

477
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:59,660
Tell him I told you to call.
He owes me a favor anyway.

478
00:37:00,703 --> 00:37:03,498
Kid, Tom's dead.

479
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,710
He's been dead almost six months.

480
00:37:09,045 --> 00:37:13,341
Then find somebody else.
Jesus Christ, Charlie, use your brains!

481
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:19,889
All right. I'll try to raise $100.

482
00:37:35,988 --> 00:37:38,793
Birdwell showed up out here
about six years ago.

483
00:37:38,898 --> 00:37:42,995
Went to work for a guy who had
a fence operation out in the Valley.

484
00:37:44,831 --> 00:37:47,698
A couple of years ago, the guy retires...

485
00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:50,545
buys himself a condominium in Florida.

486
00:37:50,878 --> 00:37:53,506
- Birdwell buys him out.
- That's it?

487
00:37:55,133 --> 00:37:57,416
What did you expect, <i>Gone with the Wind</i>?

488
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,587
If three people get killed, I expect
more than a condominium in Florida.

489
00:38:01,691 --> 00:38:04,142
Nothing's ever good enough for you.

490
00:38:07,729 --> 00:38:09,188
That's three.

491
00:38:11,566 --> 00:38:15,653
- The word is he's got dolly trouble.
- Any dolly in particular?

492
00:38:16,904 --> 00:38:18,197
His wife.

493
00:38:19,198 --> 00:38:22,035
- She was chippying around on him.
- With?

494
00:38:23,077 --> 00:38:26,039
Jesus, kid. All I had was a couple of hours.

495
00:38:32,086 --> 00:38:33,379
Want one?

496
00:38:36,341 --> 00:38:37,967
Are you kidding?

497
00:38:38,134 --> 00:38:40,355
You know what one of those
would do to my gut?

498
00:38:40,459 --> 00:38:42,055
Must be tough.

499
00:38:42,722 --> 00:38:45,589
Does Birdwell know his wife
was cheating on him?

500
00:38:45,694 --> 00:38:48,728
If he does, he's playing it close to the vest.

501
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,272
I gotta have a Coke.

502
00:38:52,774 --> 00:38:55,902
- Did you bring the dough?
- Please use the scoop.

503
00:38:57,236 --> 00:39:00,938
Yes, I brought the dough,
and I want it all back, you guys.

504
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:04,160
I mean it. From the top.
I'm keeping track, too.

505
00:39:04,452 --> 00:39:07,862
There's been $50 for Mr. Wells,
$20 for expenses...

506
00:39:07,966 --> 00:39:12,616
plus 75, 85, 95, 100...

507
00:39:12,721 --> 00:39:15,296
10, 25. You count it.

508
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,132
And I want a receipt, too.

509
00:39:19,342 --> 00:39:22,720
Come on, hurry up.
I've got this guy waiting outside.

510
00:39:28,976 --> 00:39:32,397
- This is Pepsi.
- Hurry up. Come on.

511
00:39:38,945 --> 00:39:42,563
You know what I had to go through
to hassle up this dough?

512
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:46,108
I laid off four ounces
of pure red Columbian...

513
00:39:46,212 --> 00:39:48,162
for $15 an ounce.

514
00:39:49,122 --> 00:39:51,082
I mean, it's disgusting.

515
00:39:51,624 --> 00:39:56,379
Some freak over on Pico
thinks I'm Santa Claus, I swear to God.

516
00:39:57,255 --> 00:39:58,756
$15 an ounce.

517
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:03,970
- You have a lot of faith in me, don't you?
- Come on. This is just business.

518
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:09,924
$15 an ounce.
This grass was so great, I can't tell you.

519
00:40:10,028 --> 00:40:13,980
There was so much resins in it,
it made your lips stick together.

520
00:40:16,315 --> 00:40:18,651
How long have you been pushing?

521
00:40:18,985 --> 00:40:22,155
Who says I'm pushing?
You've got a lot of nerve.

522
00:40:23,698 --> 00:40:25,324
I'm not pushing.

523
00:40:25,575 --> 00:40:29,276
You think if I was a pusher,
I'd have a little empty purse like this?

524
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:31,612
You make it sound
like I hang around schoolyards...

525
00:40:31,716 --> 00:40:34,042
trying to prey on 12-year-old kids.

526
00:40:35,251 --> 00:40:38,629
Anyways, I'm only doing it
till I get my shrink paid.

527
00:40:39,297 --> 00:40:40,965
That makes sense.

528
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,470
I had a session with her today...

529
00:40:47,638 --> 00:40:49,849
and I told her all about you.

530
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:03,196
- Don't you wanna know what I told her?
- Not particularly.

531
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:11,746
I told her that you were cute.

532
00:41:13,831 --> 00:41:15,708
You told her I was cute?

533
00:41:19,712 --> 00:41:20,922
Got it.

534
00:41:21,923 --> 00:41:24,425
Okay, that's all for me, right?

535
00:41:24,676 --> 00:41:27,793
Everything's cool?
Because I am out of here.

536
00:41:27,897 --> 00:41:30,098
Wait a minute. Just stay put.

537
00:41:31,557 --> 00:41:34,018
- Stay put? Why?
- Stay put.

538
00:41:35,103 --> 00:41:36,479
I've got a job for you.

539
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,367
Look, I don't wanna go in there.

540
00:41:39,472 --> 00:41:41,932
Let me just sit in the van here.
I can keep watch.

541
00:41:42,037 --> 00:41:46,197
According to Charlie,
this is where Escobar is hiding out, right?

542
00:41:46,447 --> 00:41:47,464
Yeah.

543
00:41:47,568 --> 00:41:49,482
- You know him, right?
- I know him.

544
00:41:49,586 --> 00:41:51,379
He's gonna be nervous. He'll have a gun.

545
00:41:51,484 --> 00:41:54,205
- He'll have a what?
- He'll have a gun.

546
00:41:55,123 --> 00:41:57,490
You can look at me and say,
"He'll have a gun"?

547
00:41:57,594 --> 00:42:00,451
- You bought into this, toots.
- Look, just back off. I mean...

548
00:42:00,555 --> 00:42:03,673
- Come on.
- Let me explain something to you...

549
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,512
I'm not good at this stuff.
Maybe I could just...

550
00:42:11,264 --> 00:42:12,932
- Okay.
- Get the key.

551
00:43:23,878 --> 00:43:24,921
Ira?

552
00:43:30,885 --> 00:43:34,013
Okay, you've seen enough.
Let's get out of here.

553
00:43:35,056 --> 00:43:37,475
Ira, don't make any noise.

554
00:43:44,482 --> 00:43:46,734
Winston. Ira, it's Winston.

555
00:43:48,695 --> 00:43:52,813
Winstie, is that you? It's Winston, my cat.

556
00:43:52,918 --> 00:43:55,733
Look, he's okay. Hello, Winstie.

557
00:43:55,837 --> 00:43:58,736
Come on, let's get out of here.
I got my cat back.

558
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,280
I take back everything
I ever thought about you.

559
00:44:01,384 --> 00:44:03,783
I swear to God. Thank you.
Let's get out of here.

560
00:44:03,887 --> 00:44:05,868
Everything's copasetic.

561
00:44:05,972 --> 00:44:08,183
I am not gonna tell you again.
I swear to God...

562
00:44:08,287 --> 00:44:10,685
if we don't get out of here,
I'm gonna start to panic.

563
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:13,292
- You're an actress, aren't you?
- I'm begging you.

564
00:44:13,396 --> 00:44:14,637
Act calm.

565
00:44:16,264 --> 00:44:19,183
- Ira, don't go in there.
- Stay put.

566
00:44:20,435 --> 00:44:22,145
Ira, wait a second.

567
00:44:27,108 --> 00:44:29,225
It's all right.
Don't leave me out here. Come on.

568
00:44:29,329 --> 00:44:31,487
Please let me in.

569
00:45:28,711 --> 00:45:33,080
Come on. It's not me, it's Winston.
He needs to stretch his little legs.

570
00:45:33,184 --> 00:45:35,426
I think he's been brainwashed.

571
00:45:42,684 --> 00:45:46,552
- Holy moly, where did she come from?
- I found her in the bathtub.

572
00:45:46,656 --> 00:45:49,899
- Aren't you gonna do something?
- You got any ideas?

573
00:45:50,149 --> 00:45:52,683
- Listen, both of you.
- I'm the one who hired you.

574
00:45:52,787 --> 00:45:56,614
- I'm warning you.
- Lady, do me a favor. Put that thing down.

575
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,191
- Margo here is not too stable.
- Yeah.

576
00:46:00,295 --> 00:46:02,485
She's liable to try something dumb.

577
00:46:02,589 --> 00:46:05,039
- Just a minute.
- Just hold your water.

578
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:10,493
Maybe I'm wrong, but you don't look like
you've had a lot of experience...

579
00:46:10,597 --> 00:46:12,547
handling a.357 magnum.

580
00:46:13,047 --> 00:46:16,300
Even so, at this close distance,
you couldn't miss.

581
00:46:16,467 --> 00:46:20,054
If something happened,
it wouldn't be a great loss to the world...

582
00:46:21,723 --> 00:46:25,852
but you'd go over on a manslaughter.
That's minimum eight to twelve.

583
00:46:26,728 --> 00:46:28,187
That's right.

584
00:46:41,034 --> 00:46:42,493
That's better.

585
00:46:53,254 --> 00:46:56,257
- Mister...
- Wells. Ira Wells.

586
00:46:57,383 --> 00:47:00,428
I'm a detective, private detective.

587
00:47:02,388 --> 00:47:07,060
I'm sorry about before, about the part
with the gun, but I was so afraid.

588
00:47:08,436 --> 00:47:09,854
Mr. Wells...

589
00:47:10,396 --> 00:47:13,691
I am going to be totally open
and honest with you.

590
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,726
I'm going to lay myself naked before you.
I hope you appreciate that.

591
00:47:17,831 --> 00:47:21,209
- He'll try.
- Get me a glass of water, will you, doll?

592
00:47:21,313 --> 00:47:25,244
Why don't you ask her
what she's doing here in the first place?

593
00:47:25,953 --> 00:47:29,457
- What did I ever do without you?
- Very little, I'm sure.

594
00:47:31,209 --> 00:47:35,546
- Now, then, Mrs...
- Birdwell. Laura Birdwell.

595
00:47:38,049 --> 00:47:41,928
- You seem like a very intelligent man.
- I've had my moments.

596
00:47:42,303 --> 00:47:44,847
I really cannot relate on this level.

597
00:47:46,432 --> 00:47:48,810
I'm in a great deal of trouble.

598
00:47:50,103 --> 00:47:53,898
I don't know how much
I can open up to you.

599
00:47:54,982 --> 00:47:58,476
Why don't you just tell it to me
in your own way, Mrs. Birdwell?

600
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:59,779
Laura.

601
00:48:03,574 --> 00:48:07,829
I got a call this afternoon from a man
who said his name was Escobar.

602
00:48:08,121 --> 00:48:11,290
- He said he had certain items.
- Here you go, ace.

603
00:48:11,624 --> 00:48:14,658
You drink too much of that,
you're gonna start seeing red rats.

604
00:48:14,763 --> 00:48:17,578
Could I please have a glass of water,
a Coke or something?

605
00:48:17,682 --> 00:48:20,925
Sure. Any friend of the hunk's
is a friend of mine.

606
00:48:21,384 --> 00:48:24,105
I'm very nervous.
You can understand that, can't you?

607
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:25,596
I can understand that.

608
00:48:28,266 --> 00:48:31,269
What could I do?
I tried to reason with him...

609
00:48:31,811 --> 00:48:34,897
but he sounded like
a truly desperate character.

610
00:48:35,314 --> 00:48:36,899
I had no choice.

611
00:48:37,608 --> 00:48:40,111
When I got here, the door was open.

612
00:48:40,987 --> 00:48:43,906
I was about to leave,
and I heard you coming.

613
00:48:44,699 --> 00:48:48,578
And I thought...
You can imagine what I thought.

614
00:48:50,288 --> 00:48:52,373
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

615
00:48:56,669 --> 00:48:59,422
Why was this Escobar blackmailing you?

616
00:48:59,714 --> 00:49:03,843
I was seeing this man.
We were having an affair.

617
00:49:04,886 --> 00:49:09,015
- Your husband didn't know about it?
- Does the Pope shit in the woods?

618
00:49:09,891 --> 00:49:12,393
Just fix the goddamn Coke, will you?

619
00:49:13,394 --> 00:49:14,604
Mr. Wells...

620
00:49:16,731 --> 00:49:17,774
Ira.

621
00:49:28,618 --> 00:49:31,152
I'm sorry, doll. What I never told you...

622
00:49:31,256 --> 00:49:34,738
is this is the hardest goddamn way
in the world to make a buck.

623
00:49:34,843 --> 00:49:36,167
Ira, look.

624
00:49:38,753 --> 00:49:39,796
Damn.

625
00:49:40,922 --> 00:49:42,298
Be careful.

626
00:49:44,592 --> 00:49:45,802
Come on.

627
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,253
Watch it!

628
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,677
Okay. Start the motor.

629
00:50:42,442 --> 00:50:45,361
All right. Now you can turn on your lights.

630
00:50:51,325 --> 00:50:53,755
- Don't miss the light.
- I'm not gonna miss the light.

631
00:50:53,859 --> 00:50:56,487
Just watch what you're doing, that's all.

632
00:50:56,591 --> 00:51:00,074
Let's go to the cops.
We really should just go to the cops.

633
00:51:00,178 --> 00:51:01,450
Let's do it, please.

634
00:51:01,554 --> 00:51:04,411
Not until I find the guy
that nailed Harry Regan.

635
00:51:04,516 --> 00:51:06,341
That is such bullshit.

636
00:51:06,841 --> 00:51:11,304
- I mean, that is such total bullshit!
- Yeah. Sure thing, doll.

637
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,213
Speed up.
He's getting a little too far ahead.

638
00:51:14,317 --> 00:51:17,466
It's disgusting.
You don't care about Harry Regan.

639
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,928
I'll tell you what this is.
This is one last chance for you...

640
00:51:21,032 --> 00:51:24,181
to go around shooting off guns at people.
Playing cops and robbers.

641
00:51:24,286 --> 00:51:27,101
You're getting off behind
all this blood and guts. It's true.

642
00:51:27,205 --> 00:51:29,614
It's very immature. You need help.

643
00:51:31,324 --> 00:51:34,483
- Now, wait a minute. Watch it.
- I can see. I'm watching.

644
00:51:34,588 --> 00:51:35,870
Tail him.

645
00:51:44,337 --> 00:51:45,672
Slow down.

646
00:51:46,798 --> 00:51:48,800
Where the hell did he go?

647
00:52:34,262 --> 00:52:35,513
Hold on!

648
00:52:40,727 --> 00:52:43,187
Holy moly, wait a second. Hold on.

649
00:53:15,928 --> 00:53:17,388
Jesus Christ!

650
00:53:20,641 --> 00:53:22,602
Hush, baby. It's okay!

651
00:53:56,678 --> 00:54:01,276
Ira, I feel so incredibly high,
I can't even tell you.

652
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,383
I feel like I've dropped acid.
Have you ever dropped acid?

653
00:54:04,487 --> 00:54:07,136
- Not in the last 10 minutes.
- Do you get this feeling...

654
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,014
Can you see anything
about me that's different?

655
00:54:10,118 --> 00:54:13,684
- Do I have a different kind of expression?
- You look higher.

656
00:54:13,788 --> 00:54:18,199
I look high right now? I am high.
Did I give you sugar?

657
00:54:18,491 --> 00:54:21,942
- I haven't had the tea yet.
- I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm thinking.

658
00:54:22,047 --> 00:54:25,446
Look at these little things in here.
Don't worry, they just float around.

659
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:27,865
They're herbs. They won't hurt you.

660
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:31,827
Everything's incredibly okay,
because I feel so high. I'm not kidding.

661
00:54:31,932 --> 00:54:33,704
I feel wonderfully high!

662
00:54:33,808 --> 00:54:38,292
I saw that space, I had some possibilities
which I considered, and I made choices.

663
00:54:38,396 --> 00:54:42,046
That's all, I went right through it.
Didn't I? It was incredible.

664
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:44,840
I had my hands on the wheel.
Didn't I take care of business?

665
00:54:44,945 --> 00:54:46,967
- You did.
- I did it. I went right through it.

666
00:54:47,072 --> 00:54:49,303
I couldn't believe it.
I thought I did a great job.

667
00:54:49,407 --> 00:54:50,721
I know you think I'm trouble.

668
00:54:50,825 --> 00:54:53,390
You probably think I'm talking
like I'm a crazy person...

669
00:54:53,495 --> 00:54:56,143
- but I feel just like Nick and Nora.
- Who?

670
00:54:56,247 --> 00:54:59,657
You know, <i>The Thin Man</i>.
Phyllis Kirk and Peter Lawford.

671
00:54:59,824 --> 00:55:03,286
Wait a second. I just got a flash.
This is incredible.

672
00:55:03,578 --> 00:55:06,529
Escobar and Brian
robbed this man Whiting, right?

673
00:55:06,633 --> 00:55:09,115
Yeah. They killed his wife
while they were at it.

674
00:55:09,219 --> 00:55:12,993
How come they didn't take it on the lam?
How come they stuck around town?

675
00:55:13,098 --> 00:55:15,371
- Ask yourself why.
- I have asked myself.

676
00:55:15,475 --> 00:55:18,124
Ask yourself again,
'cause I'm gonna tell you the answer.

677
00:55:18,228 --> 00:55:22,013
Because they found something
besides the stamps at Whiting's.

678
00:55:22,472 --> 00:55:26,465
They found something that they could
blackmail Laura Birdwell with.

679
00:55:26,569 --> 00:55:28,551
- Are you following me?
- I'm following you.

680
00:55:28,655 --> 00:55:32,899
She said she was having
a sexual relationship with another man...

681
00:55:33,066 --> 00:55:34,901
other than her husband.

682
00:55:35,777 --> 00:55:38,446
What if the guy she's making it with...

683
00:55:38,654 --> 00:55:41,407
turned out to be Whiting?

684
00:55:43,576 --> 00:55:47,205
You didn't think of that one, did you?
What about it?

685
00:55:50,166 --> 00:55:53,670
- That's pretty good.
- Pretty good? That is fabulous.

686
00:55:54,087 --> 00:55:56,339
I mean, if I do say so myself.

687
00:55:57,256 --> 00:56:00,332
I'm gonna go down to the police station...

688
00:56:00,437 --> 00:56:02,585
and get a private detective's license.

689
00:56:02,689 --> 00:56:05,129
If we teamed up, we'd be great together.

690
00:56:05,233 --> 00:56:07,631
That's just what this town
has been waiting for.

691
00:56:07,736 --> 00:56:10,760
A broken-down old private eye
with a bum leg and a hearing aid...

692
00:56:10,864 --> 00:56:12,855
and a fruitcake like you.

693
00:56:14,732 --> 00:56:17,068
I don't know. You're not so old.

694
00:56:18,653 --> 00:56:20,738
If you lost a few pounds...

695
00:56:21,989 --> 00:56:26,119
and stopped wearing those baggy suits,
you'd look 10 years younger.

696
00:56:27,495 --> 00:56:30,707
Anyway, we'd be a team.
We'd be working together.

697
00:56:31,165 --> 00:56:32,834
Don't you get it?

698
00:56:33,751 --> 00:56:36,827
You've got the experience,
and I'm this very on-top-of-it person.

699
00:56:36,932 --> 00:56:38,621
This could be big bucks for us.

700
00:56:38,725 --> 00:56:42,593
The more I think about this,
the better an idea I think it is.

701
00:56:43,177 --> 00:56:45,169
This is the most fantastic thing.

702
00:56:45,273 --> 00:56:47,943
The apartment next door is vacant,
I just remembered.

703
00:56:48,047 --> 00:56:52,103
You could move right in there.
This could be perfect. We could...

704
00:56:52,645 --> 00:56:56,691
It would be like a duplex,
a kind of suite of offices.

705
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:00,226
I think that would be perfect.
We could have cards printed up.

706
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:02,978
I feel it. I have that intuitive kind of thing.

707
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:05,564
I wouldn't mind having you next door.
It'd be okay.

708
00:57:05,669 --> 00:57:07,796
- I got to go.
- I could stand the company.

709
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,945
I wouldn't mind it. I know
what you're going to say. Don't start.

710
00:57:11,049 --> 00:57:13,030
You're gonna say,
"There's gonna be problems."

711
00:57:13,134 --> 00:57:16,826
Of course there's gonna be problems,
because that's what life is.

712
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:20,371
If I were really truthful with you,
and I'm gonna be truthful...

713
00:57:20,475 --> 00:57:24,875
in my mind,
you're a pretty old-school kind of person...

714
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,169
kind of old-fashioned and everything.

715
00:57:27,274 --> 00:57:31,517
And I don't have to tell you
that I'm kind of weird around the edges.

716
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,855
I mean, you're a slob, too, to be truthful...

717
00:57:36,564 --> 00:57:39,598
and I'm a Virgo.
That makes me a little crazy.

718
00:57:39,703 --> 00:57:43,561
But don't you see? The combination
is what makes something interesting.

719
00:57:43,665 --> 00:57:46,532
Listen, doll, let's get one thing straight.

720
00:57:47,408 --> 00:57:50,495
I'm a loner. I always have been a loner.

721
00:57:51,537 --> 00:57:53,831
I was a loner when I was a kid.

722
00:57:55,083 --> 00:57:57,460
I was a loner when I was married.

723
00:57:58,044 --> 00:58:00,046
Probably why we broke up.

724
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,810
I'm by myself now
because I like it that way.

725
00:58:03,914 --> 00:58:07,053
Nothing personal,
but I don't like to talk a lot.

726
00:58:07,553 --> 00:58:10,723
There's too damn much talk
in the world as it is.

727
00:58:12,183 --> 00:58:15,061
Listen, I know
what you're saying, because...

728
00:58:15,895 --> 00:58:18,304
I know what you mean about being alone.

729
00:58:18,408 --> 00:58:20,660
We're not very different
in that department.

730
00:58:20,765 --> 00:58:24,351
I'm a loner, too. I prefer to be alone.

731
00:58:24,456 --> 00:58:26,572
I am alone most of the time.

732
00:58:26,698 --> 00:58:29,190
Thanks a lot,
but I don't think it would work out.

733
00:58:29,294 --> 00:58:32,578
I don't want you to over-interpret
what I'm saying.

734
00:58:33,037 --> 00:58:37,490
It was something to do.
It was an exciting kind of thing tonight...

735
00:58:37,594 --> 00:58:39,784
and I got carried away with it.

736
00:58:39,888 --> 00:58:43,047
Don't worry about me
because everything's okay.

737
00:58:43,297 --> 00:58:47,093
I'm not really upset,
and I don't know why I'm doing this.

738
00:58:47,218 --> 00:58:51,691
It's just because I was excited tonight,
and it seemed like a good idea...

739
00:58:51,796 --> 00:58:53,860
and I thought of making
these little cards and...

740
00:58:53,964 --> 00:58:56,769
Doll, I'll call you tomorrow.

741
00:59:25,381 --> 00:59:28,217
- You looking for Mr. Whiting?
- Yeah.

742
00:59:29,135 --> 00:59:32,513
- He's not here.
- Do you have any idea when he'll be back?

743
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:35,277
He hasn't been home for a few days.

744
00:59:35,381 --> 00:59:38,676
If he doesn't get back by Friday,
his azaleas are gonna look like shit.

745
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:42,273
- Really? That's tough.
- You with the police?

746
00:59:43,066 --> 00:59:46,225
- That's right.
- You look kind of old to be a cop.

747
00:59:46,329 --> 00:59:48,946
Don't worry, this is just a disguise.

748
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:55,495
Listen, when you see Mr. Whiting,
tell him to call me at this number.

749
00:59:56,829 --> 00:59:59,759
What do I look like,
some kind of social secretary?

750
00:59:59,864 --> 01:00:01,834
No, you certainly do not.

751
01:00:09,342 --> 01:00:10,551
Hi, pop.

752
01:00:20,311 --> 01:00:21,896
Think fast, kid.

753
01:00:26,943 --> 01:00:29,195
Where's the rest of your iron?

754
01:00:31,614 --> 01:00:33,574
Knife. Front pocket.

755
01:00:37,578 --> 01:00:39,372
No hard feelings, pal.

756
01:00:50,216 --> 01:00:52,593
I'm not as young as I used to be.

757
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:59,350
Okay, pal...

758
01:01:02,603 --> 01:01:04,731
let's go see what we can find.

759
01:01:35,803 --> 01:01:37,096
Jump in.

760
01:01:37,555 --> 01:01:39,755
- What?
- This nose-picker here...

761
01:01:39,859 --> 01:01:43,717
is crazy enough to try some kind
of a dumb play and get himself drilled.

762
01:01:43,822 --> 01:01:46,804
Stay in the middle and tread water.
Show your hands all the time.

763
01:01:46,908 --> 01:01:50,099
- Screw you. This is a cashmere jacket!
- I said, "Jump in."

764
01:01:50,203 --> 01:01:52,612
- This old fart's crazy.
- Jump!

765
01:01:54,447 --> 01:01:55,490
Crap.

766
01:01:59,702 --> 01:02:00,745
Shit!

767
01:02:01,037 --> 01:02:04,749
If you've got something to say,
say it and get the hell out.

768
01:02:06,959 --> 01:02:10,129
- Ever hear of a man named Escobar?
- Could be.

769
01:02:12,173 --> 01:02:14,926
- He's dead.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

770
01:02:16,302 --> 01:02:19,879
I'm always sorry to hear
any of God's creatures stepping off.

771
01:02:19,983 --> 01:02:22,131
You got any idea who did it?

772
01:02:22,235 --> 01:02:24,613
If I was the cops,
I'd come looking for your wife.

773
01:02:24,717 --> 01:02:26,521
Laura? You're crazy.

774
01:02:26,813 --> 01:02:30,775
Maybe, but she was at Escobar's place
last night.

775
01:02:31,859 --> 01:02:34,404
- How do you know?
- I was there.

776
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:37,813
Had a nice talk with her.

777
01:02:37,918 --> 01:02:40,451
If you were there,
you could have killed him.

778
01:02:40,868 --> 01:02:43,663
I wasn't the one
Escobar was blackmailing.

779
01:02:45,748 --> 01:02:48,199
I've got a Vitamaster
portable steam bath inside.

780
01:02:48,303 --> 01:02:50,367
Plugs into any 110-volt outlet.

781
01:02:50,472 --> 01:02:54,100
Got a pilot light, automatic timer.
It's an effective, fun way to relax.

782
01:02:54,205 --> 01:02:56,801
Where's your wife? I'd like to talk with her.

783
01:02:59,303 --> 01:03:01,806
She went out,
about an hour-and-a-half ago.

784
01:03:02,724 --> 01:03:06,352
Never saw a woman yet who could stand
the sight of something like this.

785
01:03:06,811 --> 01:03:11,190
- Must be a couple of days old.
- Jesus Christ, Ronny! Tell him, will you?

786
01:03:13,026 --> 01:03:15,153
I don't know where Laura is.

787
01:03:16,195 --> 01:03:18,656
She disappeared a couple days ago.

788
01:03:19,032 --> 01:03:22,994
Did you know your wife was
chippying around with Walter Whiting?

789
01:03:23,369 --> 01:03:26,612
Laura and I have been
married three, almost four years.

790
01:03:26,716 --> 01:03:28,666
She's not a happy woman.

791
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,087
Reason I know she's not happy is
because she's always talking about it.

792
01:03:33,546 --> 01:03:36,049
I say screw her. What does she know?

793
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:40,845
A couple of months ago,
I get this call from a lady, Mrs. Whiting.

794
01:03:42,347 --> 01:03:43,879
She's a real fruitcake.

795
01:03:43,984 --> 01:03:47,550
Starts screaming about her putz husband
fooling around with Laura...

796
01:03:47,654 --> 01:03:50,636
- and if I don't stop it, she will.
- Come on, I'm sinking.

797
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:54,140
So I have this encounter with Laura.
Confrontation, know what I mean?

798
01:03:54,244 --> 01:03:55,641
I'm following you.

799
01:03:55,745 --> 01:03:58,686
Laura says she's not only boffing
this guy Whiting...

800
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:02,075
she can't stand the sight of me
and wants a divorce.

801
01:04:02,241 --> 01:04:05,328
I realize I'm at the <i>moment critique</i>
in my marriage.

802
01:04:05,453 --> 01:04:08,487
- Immediately, I get very calm.
- Ronny, please!

803
01:04:08,592 --> 01:04:12,450
I figure this direct confrontation shit
is getting me nowhere...

804
01:04:12,554 --> 01:04:15,463
except maybe six more months
of unhappy crap.

805
01:04:15,797 --> 01:04:20,249
Plus, if in a fit of rage, I should happen
to lay one finger upon her...

806
01:04:20,353 --> 01:04:22,887
I'll pay for it the rest of my life.

807
01:04:23,137 --> 01:04:25,682
That's the kind of woman my wife is.

808
01:04:26,182 --> 01:04:29,727
I figure there's got to be an easier way
to deal with it.

809
01:04:30,061 --> 01:04:32,407
That's when you decided
to have Whiting hit.

810
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:36,025
Nudged, not hit. Just nudged a little.

811
01:04:37,443 --> 01:04:41,364
Listen, Wells, you find Laura,
you bring her back here...

812
01:04:41,989 --> 01:04:44,815
and I promise to deliver you
a brand-new Coupe DeVille...

813
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,703
your choice of color.

814
01:04:46,869 --> 01:04:50,362
I told you before, I'm looking for the louse
that nailed Harry Regan.

815
01:04:50,467 --> 01:04:52,333
All new tires. Radials.

816
01:04:53,209 --> 01:04:56,754
Leather seats, headrest, stereo radio,
plus a tape deck.

817
01:04:57,463 --> 01:04:59,872
When you want to talk business,
give me a call.

818
01:04:59,976 --> 01:05:02,792
I'll throw in 27 tapes. All guaranteed hits!

819
01:05:02,896 --> 01:05:05,471
Popular stars of today, yesterday...

820
01:05:35,501 --> 01:05:38,035
Charles Hatter,
my name is Ronald Birdwell.

821
01:05:38,139 --> 01:05:39,714
You got the wrong guy.

822
01:05:44,302 --> 01:05:46,804
You work with a man named Ira Wells.

823
01:05:48,514 --> 01:05:49,682
Right?

824
01:05:53,644 --> 01:05:55,991
I believe this putzola Wells...

825
01:05:56,095 --> 01:05:58,816
is behaving in a cheap, immoral fashion.

826
01:05:59,442 --> 01:06:01,767
That's why I've come to ask you for help.

827
01:06:01,871 --> 01:06:04,228
If you choose to take my position...

828
01:06:04,332 --> 01:06:08,576
we're talking about a financial package
in the five-figure department.

829
01:06:08,785 --> 01:06:11,704
If you don't, it's toilet time.

830
01:06:22,131 --> 01:06:24,550
What I'm looking for is a handgun.

831
01:06:24,676 --> 01:06:27,679
Automatic Colt, .32 caliber, nickel-plated...

832
01:06:28,554 --> 01:06:32,642
serial number 473320.

833
01:06:33,267 --> 01:06:35,269
That's simple, isn't it?

834
01:06:36,604 --> 01:06:39,013
A gumball named Ray Escobar
used to have it.

835
01:06:39,117 --> 01:06:41,307
He's dead. The gun's disappeared.

836
01:06:41,411 --> 01:06:44,070
I'm depending on you to find it for me.

837
01:06:45,405 --> 01:06:46,739
<i>Comprendo?</i>

838
01:06:48,825 --> 01:06:50,368
Here's my card.

839
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:54,414
Not to worry, pal. I have confidence in you.

840
01:06:59,043 --> 01:07:00,253
Lamar.

841
01:07:07,969 --> 01:07:10,544
Then I started choking him
with his necklace.

842
01:07:10,649 --> 01:07:13,057
I said, "Let's go see your boss."

843
01:07:13,558 --> 01:07:16,133
- This guy is like his bodyguard?
- Yeah.

844
01:07:16,237 --> 01:07:17,301
He's a flunky.

845
01:07:17,405 --> 01:07:19,230
- Check?
- Yeah, thanks.

846
01:07:20,064 --> 01:07:21,102
He's walking ahead of me.

847
01:07:21,206 --> 01:07:25,184
Birdwell's just coming out of the pool.
Looked like a pregnant porpoise.

848
01:07:25,288 --> 01:07:29,542
So I got this joker at this end of the pool,
and I stick my rod in his ribs.

849
01:07:29,647 --> 01:07:33,442
I said, "Jump in."
He says to his boss, "This old guy's crazy."

850
01:07:33,546 --> 01:07:35,548
I said, "I'm not crazy, I'm just deaf."

851
01:07:35,653 --> 01:07:38,927
- "Jump in"...
- Wait. He said you were crazy to you?

852
01:07:39,031 --> 01:07:40,783
- Well, sure...
- That makes me mad.

853
01:07:40,887 --> 01:07:44,391
You know what he said? He said,
"I've got a 100% cashmere jacket on.

854
01:07:44,495 --> 01:07:47,289
"I'm not jumping in."
I said, "You're going to jump in."

855
01:07:47,394 --> 01:07:50,428
Get a load of how he jumps in.
Just like this.

856
01:07:52,764 --> 01:07:54,797
He has his shoes on and everything?

857
01:07:54,901 --> 01:07:56,934
- What is it?
- I don't know.

858
01:07:58,436 --> 01:08:01,189
I don't feel so good. My gut.

859
01:08:03,066 --> 01:08:05,026
Maybe I better sit down.

860
01:08:09,739 --> 01:08:12,127
- What is it?
- Jesus. God help me.

861
01:08:12,231 --> 01:08:13,826
What is it, Ira?

862
01:08:15,661 --> 01:08:17,872
Somebody call a doctor.

863
01:08:25,213 --> 01:08:27,131
Ira, are you all right?

864
01:08:28,925 --> 01:08:31,469
I'm fine. I feel fine.

865
01:08:33,513 --> 01:08:35,150
Everything's going to be all right.

866
01:08:35,254 --> 01:08:38,476
I called the ambulance.
They'll be here any minute.

867
01:08:44,023 --> 01:08:47,193
- Help me up, will you, doll?
- Take it easy, okay?

868
01:08:47,944 --> 01:08:50,457
Ira, wait a second.
We'll get you to the hospital.

869
01:08:50,561 --> 01:08:53,230
I'm not going to any goddamn hospital.

870
01:08:53,335 --> 01:08:55,900
You gotta go, so they can
find out what's wrong with you.

871
01:08:56,004 --> 01:08:58,996
I know what's wrong with me.
I got a perforated ulcer.

872
01:09:00,373 --> 01:09:03,949
It's starting to bleed again.
In the hospital, they'll want to operate.

873
01:09:04,054 --> 01:09:06,911
Let them. That's better
than walking around like this.

874
01:09:07,015 --> 01:09:10,091
I will not go through
another goddamn operation.

875
01:09:10,758 --> 01:09:13,188
Lay back down.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

876
01:09:13,292 --> 01:09:15,555
It's my gut. It's my life.

877
01:09:16,639 --> 01:09:19,559
I won't let anybody call me
a goddamn coward.

878
01:09:20,393 --> 01:09:24,480
I went through two operations last year
on my gut. Two operations.

879
01:09:25,398 --> 01:09:28,140
Do you realize
what it's like in a veterans' hospital...

880
01:09:28,244 --> 01:09:32,374
lying on your back for six months,
with tubes going every which way?

881
01:09:32,478 --> 01:09:35,731
Maybe I don't have much of a life
right now, but it's better than that.

882
01:09:35,835 --> 01:09:40,079
But I'll be goddamned if I let
those butchers open me up again. Never!

883
01:09:40,413 --> 01:09:43,958
- I'll blow my brains out first...
- Stop it. Just stop it.

884
01:09:51,591 --> 01:09:52,633
Okay.

885
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:59,307
Let's get out of here.

886
01:10:24,874 --> 01:10:26,292
Here we are.

887
01:10:33,341 --> 01:10:35,385
Thanks for the lift, doll.

888
01:10:36,469 --> 01:10:39,305
- Want me to go in the house with you?
- No.

889
01:10:42,809 --> 01:10:46,229
- Are you going to be all right?
- I'm fine.

890
01:11:11,253 --> 01:11:12,588
Mr. Wells.

891
01:11:13,715 --> 01:11:15,382
Yes, Mrs. Schmidt?

892
01:11:16,175 --> 01:11:18,845
- May I speak to you for a minute?
- Sure.

893
01:11:20,888 --> 01:11:23,641
I don't know how to say this, Mr. Wells.

894
01:11:23,808 --> 01:11:26,425
You've always been such a good tenant.

895
01:11:26,529 --> 01:11:31,149
Paid your rent on time, you were quiet,
until these past few days.

896
01:11:32,191 --> 01:11:36,121
But if you're going to keep young women
in your room at night...

897
01:11:36,226 --> 01:11:38,822
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

898
01:11:49,709 --> 01:11:52,545
$42.50 a month, and it's all yours.

899
01:11:55,715 --> 01:12:00,553
Mr. Wells, I'm really terribly sorry
about what happened last night...

900
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:02,680
running away like I did.

901
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:08,853
- Had a nice talk with your husband today.
- You talked with Ronny?

902
01:12:09,354 --> 01:12:10,396
Yup.

903
01:12:11,188 --> 01:12:14,692
He told me if I found you,
brought you back to him...

904
01:12:16,152 --> 01:12:19,645
- it would be worth a brand-new Cadillac.
- You wouldn't do that, would you?

905
01:12:19,749 --> 01:12:22,784
Don't be too sure. I could use a car.

906
01:12:25,202 --> 01:12:28,081
Mr. Wells. Ira.

907
01:12:29,248 --> 01:12:32,877
Last night, I felt a very deep compassion
coming from you.

908
01:12:34,086 --> 01:12:36,506
I felt a really deep sense of...

909
01:12:38,549 --> 01:12:42,762
Mr. Wells, if you won't help me,
there's no one else I can turn to.

910
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:49,811
I'd offer you a drink, but I don't think
there's enough to go around.

911
01:12:50,395 --> 01:12:53,398
Right now,
I think I need it more than you do.

912
01:12:55,775 --> 01:12:57,985
- You kill Whiting's wife?
- No.

913
01:12:59,362 --> 01:13:02,740
Ronny, my husband,
is a very violent human being.

914
01:13:04,117 --> 01:13:07,412
When he found out about
Walter Whiting and myself...

915
01:13:08,996 --> 01:13:11,499
I was terrified of what he might do.

916
01:13:13,126 --> 01:13:14,919
And I had this gun...

917
01:13:15,503 --> 01:13:18,214
and I gave it to Walter for protection.

918
01:13:18,673 --> 01:13:21,968
That's what Escobar was using
to blackmail you with.

919
01:13:22,093 --> 01:13:25,263
He said it was my gun
that killed Mrs. Whiting.

920
01:13:25,888 --> 01:13:27,098
And he said...

921
01:13:28,433 --> 01:13:31,811
if I didn't pay him
that he would hand it over to the police.

922
01:13:37,233 --> 01:13:39,569
All right. Let's go see Whiting.

923
01:13:40,194 --> 01:13:42,582
I don't know where he is.
I swear I don't know.

924
01:13:42,686 --> 01:13:46,899
Listen, lady, any day now
some hotshot detective at Homicide...

925
01:13:47,003 --> 01:13:50,694
is going to tumble on the fact
that this is more than a simple robbery.

926
01:13:50,799 --> 01:13:53,739
When they do,
they're going to come looking for Whiting.

927
01:13:53,843 --> 01:13:56,096
If the cops tag him for killing his wife...

928
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:00,214
they'll nail you as an accessory
just as sure as I'm sitting here.

929
01:14:04,052 --> 01:14:07,586
There's this place over at Fountain
and La Cienega where we used to meet.

930
01:14:07,691 --> 01:14:10,308
All right. Let's go.

931
01:14:12,018 --> 01:14:15,261
Things haven't
really been going so great lately.

932
01:14:15,365 --> 01:14:17,659
Not as well as they might have gone...

933
01:14:17,763 --> 01:14:22,695
but I don't think that's reason enough
for you to give up everything.

934
01:14:24,197 --> 01:14:26,814
Charlotte, there's one thing I want to say.

935
01:14:26,918 --> 01:14:30,964
You know this town doesn't change.
They just push the names around.

936
01:14:31,068 --> 01:14:34,874
If you want to change managers,
far be it for me to stand in your way.

937
01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:38,002
I'm just not that type, so go ahead.

938
01:14:41,673 --> 01:14:45,551
I'm telling you, Mr. Wells,
Walter wouldn't be here without me.

939
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:47,595
We'll see.

940
01:14:51,432 --> 01:14:53,643
No. Walter.

941
01:14:55,645 --> 01:14:56,854
Walter?

942
01:15:06,656 --> 01:15:09,325
God. Oh, my God!

943
01:15:16,457 --> 01:15:19,335
Ronny did this. Ronny killed him.

944
01:15:21,004 --> 01:15:23,923
Hi, this is Margo Sperling. Is Ira Wells in?

945
01:15:24,716 --> 01:15:26,676
Oh, God. No.

946
01:15:27,593 --> 01:15:31,796
If he calls, would you tell him, please,
to call me? It's very important.

947
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,600
Margo. Okay, thanks a lot.

948
01:15:52,577 --> 01:15:55,621
- C.S. Hatter Productions.
<i>- Charles, it's Margo.</i>

949
01:15:56,748 --> 01:15:59,115
<i>Do you know where Ira is?</i>
<i>I've got to talk to him.</i>

950
01:15:59,219 --> 01:16:01,826
How the hell would I know?
What's the matter?

951
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:03,828
<i>Something funny has happened.</i>

952
01:16:03,932 --> 01:16:06,559
<i>I was going to feed Winston tonight.</i>

953
01:16:06,664 --> 01:16:11,377
<i>I've had a lot of trouble getting him back</i>
<i>on schedule since the kidnapping...</i>

954
01:16:11,481 --> 01:16:15,141
<i>and I looked down</i>
<i>and I found this gun laying on the floor.</i>

955
01:16:15,308 --> 01:16:17,174
- No shit.
<i>- I'm pretty sure it's real...</i>

956
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:21,564
<i>- and I want to find Ira...</i>
- Margo, don't worry. I'll handle it.

957
01:16:29,072 --> 01:16:32,825
I was here this afternoon.
My husband must have followed me.

958
01:16:38,873 --> 01:16:41,250
Mr. Wells, I'm scared.

959
01:16:42,085 --> 01:16:44,472
If my husband can do something like this
to Walter...

960
01:16:44,577 --> 01:16:48,091
he'll do the same thing to me. He'll kill me.

961
01:16:49,676 --> 01:16:51,552
You've got to help me.

962
01:16:53,221 --> 01:16:56,015
It's raining everywhere these days, lady.

963
01:16:56,516 --> 01:16:59,477
That gun of yours,
the one you gave Whiting...

964
01:16:59,852 --> 01:17:03,523
- it was a.32, right?
- I think we should call the police.

965
01:17:10,029 --> 01:17:11,864
Why don't you do that?

966
01:17:12,532 --> 01:17:15,357
I'd like to be around
when you try and explain to the cops...

967
01:17:15,462 --> 01:17:18,454
that Whiting's wife
was murdered in this dump.

968
01:17:18,579 --> 01:17:21,635
Mrs. Whiting caught you
and her husband here one night.

969
01:17:21,739 --> 01:17:25,336
There was a fight.
When it was all over, she ends up dead.

970
01:17:27,505 --> 01:17:31,968
Mr. Wells, some of the things
I told you before were untruths.

971
01:17:34,762 --> 01:17:36,347
Still not there?

972
01:17:36,764 --> 01:17:41,060
Tell him that I called again...
Wait, I think this is him. Thanks a lot.

973
01:17:44,897 --> 01:17:46,774
- Ira...
- Hiya, doll.

974
01:17:47,316 --> 01:17:50,153
Margo Sperling. Ron Birdwell, Jeff Lamar.

975
01:17:50,445 --> 01:17:53,270
I'm tied up right now.
I'm working on something.

976
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:55,940
Would you mind waiting in...
Don't you push me.

977
01:17:56,044 --> 01:17:57,087
Okay.

978
01:17:57,379 --> 01:18:00,945
I'd like to invite you in,
but I've got work that I have to finish...

979
01:18:01,049 --> 01:18:04,219
so please don't sit down.
What do they think they're doing?

980
01:18:04,323 --> 01:18:07,670
Listen, remember that gun
that we were talking about?

981
01:18:08,046 --> 01:18:10,882
This guy Birdwell, he's willing to buy it.

982
01:18:13,217 --> 01:18:16,095
- What about Ira?
- Let me tell you something.

983
01:18:17,096 --> 01:18:21,340
Ira Wells was a broken-down old bum
who was never any good to start with.

984
01:18:21,444 --> 01:18:23,968
That schmuck blew every chance he had.

985
01:18:24,072 --> 01:18:26,241
And he'll blow this one, too, if I let him.

986
01:18:26,345 --> 01:18:28,013
We'll give him a couple of thou...

987
01:18:28,118 --> 01:18:31,944
let him go to the track
and act like a big shot. You know.

988
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:34,583
Get them out of here.

989
01:18:34,687 --> 01:18:37,022
How the hell long
are you gonna stay in there?

990
01:18:37,127 --> 01:18:40,484
- Just a minute, pal.
- I mean it, get them out of here...

991
01:18:40,589 --> 01:18:42,789
- and you get out, too.
- Easy, now.

992
01:18:43,164 --> 01:18:46,031
Hold on. Listen. I'm running into a little...

993
01:18:46,136 --> 01:18:48,367
I'm through shitting around with you,
you putzola.

994
01:18:48,471 --> 01:18:51,172
I want you to give me the gun.

995
01:18:51,339 --> 01:18:55,927
Mr. Birdwell, I'm the one that has the gun.
I mean, it's in my possession.

996
01:18:56,636 --> 01:18:59,972
Charles told me
what you are offering and I'm...

997
01:19:00,556 --> 01:19:01,599
Wait!

998
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,898
Hit her, for God's sake.
She's got the goddamn gun.

999
01:19:09,315 --> 01:19:11,943
- He has a point, Lamar.
- Wait a second.

1000
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:17,990
If you lay a hand on me,
you're gonna pay for it in your next life.

1001
01:19:18,866 --> 01:19:21,369
Violence has never solved anything.

1002
01:19:21,994 --> 01:19:25,790
If you come one step closer,
I'm gonna break this right in your face.

1003
01:19:27,917 --> 01:19:29,252
Answer it.

1004
01:20:07,582 --> 01:20:09,375
Hello, doll. Ira.

1005
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:12,378
<i>I'm at Whiting's place.</i>

1006
01:20:12,754 --> 01:20:15,923
<i>He's dead.</i>
<i>I've got this whole thing figured out.</i>

1007
01:20:16,299 --> 01:20:17,800
<i>- Ira...</i>
- Doll...

1008
01:20:18,301 --> 01:20:21,846
in case you're interested,
I know who killed Harry Regan.

1009
01:20:23,139 --> 01:20:24,182
It was Birdwell.

1010
01:20:24,515 --> 01:20:27,153
<i>Stay put, okay?</i>
<i>I'm on my way over to your place.</i>

1011
01:20:27,258 --> 01:20:28,770
Don't hang up...

1012
01:20:35,568 --> 01:20:36,611
Lamar...

1013
01:20:37,737 --> 01:20:41,699
how would you like a new Coupe DeVille,
color of your choice?

1014
01:20:46,746 --> 01:20:49,957
Mr. Wells, I cannot tell you
how good it feels...

1015
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:53,221
to have finally opened up
and told the truth...

1016
01:20:53,325 --> 01:20:56,130
to have opened up
the dark side of my soul.

1017
01:20:56,339 --> 01:20:58,716
It's like stepping into the sunlight.

1018
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:11,062
I'm all right.

1019
01:21:19,445 --> 01:21:21,771
Listen, he's an old guy. He's not even well.

1020
01:21:21,875 --> 01:21:24,210
He needs an operation,
one on his stomach.

1021
01:21:24,315 --> 01:21:26,953
I know we could talk this over
and work something out.

1022
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:29,789
There's no reason to get him.

1023
01:21:30,623 --> 01:21:33,251
Mr. Birdwell, let me give you the gun.

1024
01:21:34,335 --> 01:21:36,129
Why don't I do that?

1025
01:21:36,379 --> 01:21:38,725
I don't know why
I didn't give it to you before.

1026
01:21:38,829 --> 01:21:42,124
I know how much you want it,
and I don't even care about the gun.

1027
01:21:42,228 --> 01:21:43,928
I'll do that, okay?

1028
01:21:46,931 --> 01:21:48,808
I'm going to stand up.

1029
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:53,104
See? I'm standing up.

1030
01:21:53,688 --> 01:21:56,399
I'm just going to walk across the room.

1031
01:21:56,733 --> 01:21:59,444
Here I am. I'm walking across the room.

1032
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:03,948
I'll open this drawer. See me opening it?

1033
01:22:04,866 --> 01:22:06,065
Just take it and go.

1034
01:22:06,169 --> 01:22:09,495
What about me? What about yours truly?
We had a deal.

1035
01:22:09,787 --> 01:22:12,133
"Twelve bills for the gun."
That's a direct quote.

1036
01:22:12,238 --> 01:22:16,210
You know, that old guy isn't so dumb.
He's right about Harry Regan.

1037
01:22:17,337 --> 01:22:18,838
I killed him.

1038
01:23:07,595 --> 01:23:09,681
- Ronny.
- You okay?

1039
01:23:10,348 --> 01:23:13,893
Darling, you must think
I'm such a terrible person.

1040
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:17,313
Ira!

1041
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:24,779
Do something. I told you he was sick.

1042
01:23:30,368 --> 01:23:32,495
You don't look so good, pop.

1043
01:23:37,583 --> 01:23:39,825
Ronny, you ever been to Florida?

1044
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:43,016
They got these old turtles that crawl up
on the beach at night.

1045
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:47,719
As a kid, I'd sneak up with a two-by-four
and flip them over on their backs.

1046
01:23:48,011 --> 01:23:49,595
They looked just like that.

1047
01:23:53,057 --> 01:23:55,560
A doctor. I want...

1048
01:23:56,269 --> 01:23:59,022
- What did you say, old man?
- I want a...

1049
01:24:02,608 --> 01:24:05,069
You wanna know something, punk?

1050
01:24:05,528 --> 01:24:08,698
You were born dumb,
and you're going to die dumb.

1051
01:24:12,744 --> 01:24:14,120
Now get up.

1052
01:24:15,246 --> 01:24:16,456
Get up!

1053
01:24:18,374 --> 01:24:19,625
Hurry up!

1054
01:24:23,296 --> 01:24:25,423
Park it over in that chair.

1055
01:24:31,262 --> 01:24:35,808
All right, sit down.
Keep your hands nice and quiet.

1056
01:24:37,727 --> 01:24:39,645
And your mouth shut up.

1057
01:24:43,191 --> 01:24:46,444
- Are you all right?
- Never been better.

1058
01:24:49,238 --> 01:24:52,909
Pretty nice. Pretty slick.

1059
01:24:54,285 --> 01:24:57,830
You knew if I fell for it,
they'd fall for it, right?

1060
01:24:58,706 --> 01:25:00,322
Of course I didn't fall for it.

1061
01:25:00,427 --> 01:25:03,638
You son of a bitch,
don't you even do that to me again.

1062
01:25:03,742 --> 01:25:07,507
What if I had fallen for it?
I could have had a heart attack.

1063
01:25:08,341 --> 01:25:11,146
Here's someone I really care about,
drop dead at my feet.

1064
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:13,846
How am I supposed to feel about that?

1065
01:25:13,971 --> 01:25:17,089
Mentally deranged, that's how.
Probably for the...

1066
01:25:17,193 --> 01:25:19,487
Doll, you're still alive, aren't you?

1067
01:25:19,592 --> 01:25:23,189
That's another thing. Don't call me doll.
I don't like it.

1068
01:25:24,399 --> 01:25:27,860
- Pop, she's a real loony bird.
- You're not?

1069
01:25:30,279 --> 01:25:33,533
You don't mind if I sit down, do you?
I've had a tough day.

1070
01:25:39,205 --> 01:25:42,875
Kid, just hear me out
before you do anything crazy.

1071
01:25:43,376 --> 01:25:46,577
We've got this guy between
a rock and a hard place, see?

1072
01:25:46,681 --> 01:25:49,841
We're in a position
to make an A-number-one deal.

1073
01:25:50,925 --> 01:25:53,250
Nice to see a man who loves his wife.

1074
01:25:53,355 --> 01:25:55,753
Get used to something.
She doesn't love you back.

1075
01:25:55,857 --> 01:25:57,421
- Ronny, do something...
- Be quiet.

1076
01:25:57,525 --> 01:26:01,217
Laura kills Mrs. Whiting
at that love nest over on Fountain Avenue.

1077
01:26:01,321 --> 01:26:04,564
She calls Brian Hemphill
and gets him to clean up her mess.

1078
01:26:04,939 --> 01:26:07,765
Escobar and Brian move the body
back to Whiting's house...

1079
01:26:07,869 --> 01:26:11,529
and fake the stamp caper
to throw the cops off the track.

1080
01:26:11,779 --> 01:26:15,533
That's water over the dam.
Let's cut to the chase.

1081
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:20,413
Escobar's got the gun Laura used
on Mrs. Whiting and blackmails her.

1082
01:26:20,830 --> 01:26:22,488
Somewhere along the way...

1083
01:26:22,592 --> 01:26:25,345
Birdwell realizes
if he can get a hold of that gun...

1084
01:26:25,449 --> 01:26:28,682
Laura will have to stick to him like glue
for the rest of her life.

1085
01:26:28,786 --> 01:26:31,883
Why are you putting my wife
under this pressure?

1086
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:34,886
He and this joker go looking for Escobar.

1087
01:26:35,094 --> 01:26:38,796
They catch up with him at that palace
he had in Santa Monica...

1088
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:40,631
put the arm on him...

1089
01:26:40,735 --> 01:26:42,758
but Lamar gets carried away and kills him.

1090
01:26:42,862 --> 01:26:44,270
I can see...

1091
01:26:45,813 --> 01:26:47,857
this is going to cost me.

1092
01:26:48,775 --> 01:26:53,404
By now Whiting's starting to get nervous.
He's in this mess way over his head.

1093
01:26:54,113 --> 01:26:56,084
He decides to go to the cops.

1094
01:26:56,188 --> 01:26:58,649
Laura couldn't afford that,
so she had to kill him.

1095
01:26:58,753 --> 01:26:59,859
That's a lie.

1096
01:26:59,963 --> 01:27:03,404
That's when you came to me,
hoping I'd play the sap for you.

1097
01:27:03,508 --> 01:27:06,584
- He's lying.
- No, that's exactly what happened.

1098
01:27:06,751 --> 01:27:08,659
You figure I'll want to talk to Whiting.

1099
01:27:08,763 --> 01:27:13,038
You take me there, I'll sniff around,
and think your husband killed him.

1100
01:27:13,143 --> 01:27:17,001
- You don't believe him, do you?
- I'm not saying you're right...

1101
01:27:17,105 --> 01:27:18,888
but what's the price?

1102
01:27:19,472 --> 01:27:23,685
I've been in this business 31 years,
give or take a couple of months.

1103
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:26,479
I've always played it on the up and up.

1104
01:27:26,896 --> 01:27:30,149
- Call the cops.
- Hold it!

1105
01:27:31,192 --> 01:27:34,362
Put that thing down.
You haven't got the ass to swing it.

1106
01:27:35,363 --> 01:27:38,189
All my life I've been a loser,
from the day I was born.

1107
01:27:38,293 --> 01:27:40,493
What makes you any different now?

1108
01:27:40,618 --> 01:27:43,089
What makes you think
Birdwell's gonna sit still...

1109
01:27:43,194 --> 01:27:45,863
for some chiseler like you
to take that kind of dough off?

1110
01:27:45,967 --> 01:27:49,700
I'll make him, that's why.
Because I've got him by the short hairs.

1111
01:27:49,804 --> 01:27:52,703
Yeah, you'll make him,
just like Harry Regan made him.

1112
01:27:52,807 --> 01:27:55,435
Harry goes to Birdwell,
tries to deal himself in...

1113
01:27:55,539 --> 01:27:57,166
but Birdwell can't gamble on...

1114
01:27:57,270 --> 01:27:59,585
some two-bit chiseler
gumming up the works...

1115
01:27:59,689 --> 01:28:02,181
so they meet someplace for a payoff.

1116
01:28:02,682 --> 01:28:05,977
Birdwell unloads a.45 point-blank
into his stomach.

1117
01:28:17,697 --> 01:28:19,657
You dumb son of a bitch.

1118
01:28:21,034 --> 01:28:23,870
- Didn't I tell you you'd blow it?
- Mr. Wells.

1119
01:28:23,995 --> 01:28:25,788
Sit down and shut up.

1120
01:28:32,587 --> 01:28:34,005
Six figures.

1121
01:28:35,381 --> 01:28:37,842
He was going to pay us six figures.

1122
01:28:38,301 --> 01:28:43,097
Police emergency?
It's 3626 Franklin. Apartment 405.

1123
01:28:43,681 --> 01:28:46,267
We have a dying man here. Step on it.

1124
01:28:53,399 --> 01:28:55,360
Jesus Christ.

1125
01:28:56,069 --> 01:28:59,572
How did I ever get mixed up with you
in the first place?

1126
01:29:00,073 --> 01:29:03,076
You're right, Charlie. I'll never learn.

1127
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:10,458
- I think maybe I better sit down now.
- Yeah.

1128
01:29:11,292 --> 01:29:12,627
All right.

1129
01:29:13,586 --> 01:29:15,797
- I think I'll sit down.
- Okay.

1130
01:29:25,098 --> 01:29:27,725
- You believe in reincarnation?
- I don't know.

1131
01:29:28,935 --> 01:29:31,104
Never thought much about it.

1132
01:29:32,105 --> 01:29:36,275
I hate to think of Charles
just floating around in the eternal void.

1133
01:29:36,484 --> 01:29:40,029
I like to think
he's gonna drop around again sometime...

1134
01:29:40,154 --> 01:29:42,615
even if he was pretty non-evolved.

1135
01:29:43,616 --> 01:29:44,659
You know what I mean?

1136
01:29:46,703 --> 01:29:50,331
Charlie did the best he knew how.
That's for sure.

1137
01:29:55,003 --> 01:29:56,671
Where you headed?

1138
01:29:57,005 --> 01:29:59,288
I was going to take this
number 10 to Highland...

1139
01:29:59,392 --> 01:30:00,664
then transfer to number four.

1140
01:30:00,769 --> 01:30:03,876
That should let me off a couple of blocks
from my house.

1141
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:06,514
- What about you?
- I don't know.

1142
01:30:08,141 --> 01:30:10,560
Mrs. Schmidt asked me to move out.

1143
01:30:15,815 --> 01:30:18,985
That place next door to you,
is that still empty?

1144
01:30:20,862 --> 01:30:23,781
I don't know, I don't think I could take it.

1145
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:26,419
You just never say anything,
for God's sake.

1146
01:30:26,524 --> 01:30:29,401
It's not fair. I've to keep up
my side of the conversation...

1147
01:30:29,506 --> 01:30:31,789
and your side of the conversation.

1148
01:30:32,582 --> 01:30:35,501
Yeah, that's it. You just never
say anything, for God's sake.

1149
01:30:36,127 --> 01:30:38,035
I want some feedback from you.

1150
01:30:38,139 --> 01:30:41,049
I want to know
what you think about things...

1151
01:30:42,050 --> 01:30:44,177
and what you think about me.

1152
01:30:47,972 --> 01:30:51,809
Jesus Christ, would it kill you, if,
once in a while, you wore a goddamn dress?

1153
01:30:52,305 --> 01:30:58,468
