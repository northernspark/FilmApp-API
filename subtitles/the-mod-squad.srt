2
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,647
Cops!

3
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:01,926
Cops!

4
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:05,453
Julie Barnes. Runaway.
An addict at 18. A fighter.

5
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,296
This little girl
was as hard as they come.

6
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:25,414
Pete Cochran. A lost cause.
The world's biggest screwup.

7
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,113
He went straight from Beverly Hills
to county jail.

8
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,839
Lincoln Hayes. He doesn't blame
his crimes on anything.

9
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,571
Had reasons all his own
to burn the world down.

10
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,388
Easy, man!

11
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,618
Your mother and I have been
worried sick, little girl.

12
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,093
You gonna have to give it up
to Daddy, now. Come on.

13
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,595
Hey! Stop!

14
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,429
Take this police brutality, baby!

15
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,265
Out of my way!

16
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,075
All right, I'm gettin' out of here!
Dude, relax.

17
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,104
Get those skinny leather pants
out of here!

18
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:34,142
Go! You little shit.
You're gonna get caught.

19
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,924
Easy, baby. Why the hackles?

20
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,844
- How you doin'?
- Okay.

21
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,011
Yeah? Can you hear me?

22
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:08,678
Okay.

23
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:14,017
They could've been anybody,
no better or worse than the rest.

24
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:18,462
Heading for nowhere.
Until I gave them one last chance.

25
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,117
- I'm gonna kill those kids.
- They're mine.

26
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:42,916
- If anybody does, it's me.
- They're screwing with my men.

27
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,049
- Is there a problem, fellas?
- No.

28
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,855
- Workin' late again tonight, huh?
- Yeah.

29
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:52,557
Every night, until we find out who stole
those drugs from the evidence locker.

30
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,270
- IA.
- They were just doing their job.

31
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,500
Hello, Los Angeles!

32
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,702
- Adam...
- They didn't volunteer for this job.

33
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,267
- It was my idea.
- They're punks.

34
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,814
- We're supposed to give them a chance.
- Come on!

35
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,645
You're gonna side with them?
They're not real cops!

36
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,948
They can't even carry guns,
for God's sakes.

37
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,285
Maybe you should spend a little more
time worrying about your own guys...

38
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,335
- and a little less time...
- What's that supposed to mean?

39
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,090
Nothing. These kids can get into
a thousand places that we can't.

40
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:30,127
You three really screwed up tonight.
Get your feet off that table. Get up!

41
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,297
What are you talking about, man?
We got the job done.

42
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,934
- Yeah, we set the bad guys up, right?
- Why don't you shut up and listen.

43
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,088
You should be yelling at the cops
for beating up kids.

44
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,239
You smacked Detective Tricky
in the mouth.

45
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,953
Do you think this is a joke?
You little numb-nut.

46
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,753
Okay, Bob, I'll take care of this.
Let me take care of this.

47
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,486
- Yeah, Bob!
- Hey!

48
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,361
Sit down and shut up. Sit!

49
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,635
You think this is a joke?

50
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:06,297
If you think it's a joke, I'll stick you
right back into the cells...

51
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,499
where I found you.

52
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:11,236
You're policemen now.
Stop screwing around...

53
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,404
and start doing your job.

54
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,879
If you're gonna start overacting
like circus freaks...

55
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:19,076
you might as well be wearin' badges,
for crying out loud!

56
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,779
Are we done yet?

57
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,822
- Excuse me?
- Are we done?

58
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,983
You're done when I say we're done.

59
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,337
- Is that Harry? It looks like him.
- All right, everybody.

60
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,421
- Listen up.
- Save it for the kiddies, Greer.

61
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,202
That's pretty funny.

62
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,433
All right, tough guy.

63
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,875
If you or anybody else
has got a problem with my squad...

64
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,436
you gotta go through me first.

65
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,947
Any takers?

66
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:37,126
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

67
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,221
Thanks for asking.

68
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,377
Eckford and Lanier aren't here.
I got something to do.

69
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,335
We'll get started without them.
Follow me.

70
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,505
You guys see that club down there?

71
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:53,534
We have reason to believe there's
a black book operation goin' on inside.

72
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:57,242
- What's black book?
- Hookers. Expensive ones.

73
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:00,843
Young girls. We also think
the manager, Red Wilson, is involved.

74
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,583
Julie, you go inside undercover as
a waitress and hopefully get recruited.

75
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,455
Why does she always get to be
the prostitute?

76
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,223
You two will go inside,
split up, blend...

77
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:13,356
work the room and keep your eye
on this Red character.

78
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,165
All right, listen to me.

79
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,262
Be nice to these guys.

80
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:24,366
They've been on this case for a while.
They're not gonna like working with you.

81
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,435
Do what they tell you to
and remember to...

82
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,242
- Keep our noses clean?
- Exactly.

83
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:32,375
- Sorry we're late, Adam.
- Yeah, sorry we're late.

84
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,546
- Hey, no excuses, partner.
- You're not my partner.

85
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,914
We went over the assignments
and the background.

86
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,551
You guys work out the logistics
amongst yourselves.

87
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,667
Which one's Eckford
and which one's Lanier?

88
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,670
Save it. This is our case.

89
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,036
We don't want you little pussies
playing cop inside.

90
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,337
Making our J-O-B
all that much harder.

91
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,901
You dig?

92
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,815
She comes in. Yeah.

93
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,218
There you go, little girl.

94
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,483
Two grams, asshole.

95
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:14,185
- Call a cop.
- Fuck you, pig!

96
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,002
Are you okay?

97
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:29,269
- Yeah.
- You wanna come back inside?

98
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,872
Excuse me.

99
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:10,939
- Listen, I gotta meet up with Greer.
- What, now?

100
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,178
Yeah, you know how the man is
about punctuality.

101
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,277
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

102
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:18,915
- Keep an eye out for Julie, okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

103
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,333
Hey! How's it goin', girl?

104
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,874
You wanna come up to my office
after your shift?

105
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,413
I've been meaning to ask you
if I can work some extra hours.

106
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,812
- I can really use the cash.
- Yeah, yeah.

107
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:48,217
Well, I, you know...
We'll see what we can do. Huh?

108
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,733
You mind if I cut in?

109
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,065
Hey, there.

110
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,572
How you been? Long time.

111
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,706
Yeah.

112
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,582
God, what's it been,
like three years?

113
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:30,618
I never thought I'd see you again.
You look really great, you know?

114
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,558
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yeah.

115
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,663
Can I get a club soda
with a lemon?

116
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,571
Really?

117
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,406
I have two years in July.

118
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,343
Right on.
Year and a half last month.

119
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,316
Really? That's great.

120
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,486
You been doin' this long or what?

121
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,951
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

122
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,931
I haven't seen that smile
in a long time.

123
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,702
So, I guess I should let you
get back to work.

124
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,299
Yeah.

125
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:25,112
Hey, listen.
Can I see you again?

126
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,311
Okay.

127
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,513
Okay, then?

128
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,826
Oh, my God!

129
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,063
- Tiffany!
- Uh-oh.

130
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,666
What "uh-oh"?

131
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,373
Okay, wait, wait.

132
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,385
Get up!

133
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,755
Get the hell out of here!

134
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,834
I saw Greer roll up on this cat
with leather pants.

135
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,240
What?

136
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,440
The dude from the bust.
I saw Greer pick him up.

137
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,251
It was the same guy
I saw at the bust last week.

138
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:12,416
- A cop was helping him get away.
- Are you sure it was Greer?

139
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:17,260
- Looked like his car.
- Every car looks like his car.

140
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,263
That's the point of the car.

141
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,891
Dude, you're paranoid.

142
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,435
Nice job!

143
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:28,269
Okay, I really did not
like that at all, all right?

144
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,241
Let me just explain somethin'.
I was blending.

145
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,245
You just blended your ass
right out of the club, man.

146
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,908
Oh, come on! They're gonna
let me back in the club.

147
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,146
I believe the words were
"you're gone for-fucking-ever."

148
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,519
- Greer's gonna kick your ass.
- You know what? Eat me.

149
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,150
Come on. Let's go.
You wanna lose another fight, Petey?

150
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,024
Who was the guy that
you were talkin' to all night?

151
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,461
- What guy?
- Yeah, "what guy."

152
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,123
A suspect?

153
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,363
What? No. I don't even know
what he's talkin' about.

154
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:01,304
How could you see anything? You had your
head buried in a pair of tits all night.

155
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,865
I could see things because
I got eyes behind my head, all right?

156
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:08,243
- Julie's got a boyfriend
- Please grow up.

157
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,442
Let's all together, in harmony.

158
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:15,817
Hey, mommy! Where you goin'
with that fine little ass, baby?

159
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:19,346
Why don't you get out in the street
and earn a real living, huh?

160
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,290
- What?
- She digs me.

161
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,727
- You have your hall pass, young lady?
- You wanna see my hall pass?

162
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,288
Yeah, and then I wanna see you
in detention.

163
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,460
Why do you have to be such a pussy?
Leave her alone.

164
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,731
Who you callin' a pussy, pussy?

165
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:36,468
- Motherfucker.
- Oh, God, you terrify me.

166
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,706
- Tricky, just back off, man.
- Get outta my face, boy.

167
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,111
- What?
- Let's go. In my office.

168
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,116
Move your ass.

169
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,516
In my office. Move your ass!

170
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,989
- Where were you last night?
- Excuse me?

171
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,535
You left me out on the street
for, like, an hour.

172
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:06,798
I was doin' something.

173
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:09,864
I'd love to know what you were doin'
while I was out there waitin'.

174
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,103
- It's a police matter.
- What's a police matter?

175
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,322
- Shut your face.
- Why don't you try stealin' drugs...

176
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:17,213
- from the evidence locker?
- What? What'd you say?

177
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,944
Stealin' drugs
from the evidence locker.

178
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,509
You better watch what you say
and who you're saying it to.

179
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,919
- Let me tell you something, Linc.
- Save it.

180
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,082
Shut up and listen to me.

181
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:29,457
One of these days, you'll wake up
and be 30. Who knows? Maybe even 40.

182
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:32,258
Get up when I talk to you.
Get up.

183
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,191
And you're gonna be alone,
all alone.

184
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,465
You're gonna realize not everybody
in this world is your enemy.

185
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:44,908
I'm trying to do my job. I suggest you
do the same and quit breaking my balls.

186
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,040
It's enough already.

187
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,485
Get off my desk, please.

188
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:59,115
- Is there any luck at the club?
- Look, Captain.

189
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:03,855
We're just trying to get
really, really deep undercover.

190
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:04,953
Yeah.

191
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,897
- The manager's a real creep.
- Yeah? And?

192
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,368
It feels like there's definitely
something going on in there.

193
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:15,430
I don't care about feelings. This isn't
a feelings business. Get some evidence.

194
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:18,237
You're on the roof
with Eckford and Lanier.

195
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:24,414
Take off those stupid sunglasses
and do what you're told.

196
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,178
Yes, sir.

197
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:29,414
There are people breathing down my neck
to get rid of all three of you.

198
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,013
- What'd we do?
- Arson, assault and robbery.

199
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:36,187
Now, get out. And remember, I'm the only
thing keeping you clowns out of prison.

200
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,788
- Man, this job sucks!
- Beats jail.

201
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,799
A deal's a deal.

202
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,383
- What the hell?
- Dude, they're not there.

203
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:05,549
- What are you doin' in here?
- Eckford and Lanier.

204
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:07,817
What?

205
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,726
They never showed.
Give me the keys.

206
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:16,491
- The keys to what?
- I got no car. This is a stakeout.

207
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,165
- Are you crazy? Hell no.
- Come on!

208
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,540
This is a cop thing. You can't just
leave me standing there like an asshole.

209
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:29,741
- I swear to God, man. One scratch...
- All right.

210
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:02,036
- What can I get you, slick?
- I'll take a malt liquor, sister.

211
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:05,311
I need you to find out everything
you can about this guy over there...

212
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:08,376
with the blonde hair
and leather pants in the booth.

213
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,113
Is he your guy?

214
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,085
Yeah.

215
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,060
All right.
I'll see what I can do.

216
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,775
- What?
- It's so freaky to see you again.

217
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,377
- Freaky?
- Yeah.

218
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,151
- Maybe it's just the hair. I don't know.
- My hair?

219
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,594
I wanna say that I'm sorry
about what happened before.

220
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:55,121
About not calling
and disappearing like that.

221
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,192
- I was an asshole.
- Forget it. It was a long time ago.

222
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,750
- We were both really fucked up.
- Yeah, I know, but I'm sorry.

223
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,572
- I'm sorry that I hurt you.
- Forgiven. It's over. We're movin' on.

224
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:10,840
What are you doin' in this place
other than keeping me from my job?

225
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,281
Take a break?

226
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,581
Now?

227
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,746
- Just to talk.
- Yeah.

228
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,792
You can page me
if you need to talk to me.

229
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,959
See ya!

230
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:33,596
- Bye, Gilbert.
- Let's go. You can do this later.

231
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,377
How are you doin'?

232
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:44,242
- I'm all right.
- Are you here with someone?

233
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:47,683
- No.
- Would you like to be?

234
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,522
Maybe later. I gotta go.

235
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,092
Not really goin' for
waitress of the month, are you?

236
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,531
Apparently not. I missed you.

237
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,143
- Hey, there.
- Hi.

238
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,705
Whoa, whoa.
I thought we were just gonna talk.

239
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,806
Oh, please.

240
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,552
Hey, my man!

241
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,847
Okay, give me the keys.
Give me the keys!

242
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,249
Gilbert, no, man.
I'm giving you a ride. That's enough.

243
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,253
Give me the keys.

244
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,249
- Be careful.
- Always.

245
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,190
- Pop the trunk.
- Why?

246
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:06,357
Because it's cold and buggin'.
I want my jacket. Okay, Gilbert?

247
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,139
Put on your jacket and let's go!

248
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,310
- Ah, man!
- "Ah, man" what?

249
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,251
- Hey.
- Cops!

250
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,381
Cops? Shit!

251
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,719
Get the car!

252
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,405
Shit!

253
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,408
Shit, shit, shit!

254
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,613
Come on, man!

255
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,685
Sorry!

256
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,223
Who's your friend?

257
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:50,125
Look, man, I was just giving him
a lift, man. That's all.

258
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,287
Where?

259
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,025
Just under the Sixth St. bridge.
That was all.

260
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,397
I was just gonna take him
under the Sixth St. bridge!

261
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,402
His name's Gilbert O'Reilly.

262
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:02,167
I told him I'd give him a ride.
I was, like, designated driver.

263
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,299
You know, like a car pool.

264
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:07,140
I'll take you to where he lives.
Okay, you want a car wash?

265
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,579
I work at the Valley Car Wash.
I'll give you a free car wash...

266
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,913
on the...

267
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,696
Julie, someone said
they saw you come in here.

268
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,892
- What?
- What are you doing in here?

269
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,162
What do you think I'm doing, Red?

270
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:39,670
I've been lookin' for you all night.
You're not supposed to be in the VIP.

271
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:43,339
Finish up and get your ass
back down to work.

272
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,789
Oh, my God.

273
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,318
- I guess I should get back to work.
- Oh, really?

274
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,522
Yeah. You can stay up here,
if you want.

275
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:02,328
- You know what? I have to go.
- Oh, okay.

276
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,927
- I have to go to this club.
- That's cool.

277
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,770
Look. Here's my number.
You call me. I mean it.

278
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:13,743
Whenever you need anything,
anytime, please.

279
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:21,351
- Okay?
- It's nice talking to you.

280
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,444
It's nice talking to you too.

281
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:26,885
- See you.
- See you.

282
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,487
Oh, God.

283
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,703
Linc, I can't believe it, man.

284
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,705
I mean, I can't...

285
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:45,072
I mean, I can't believe it, man.

286
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,010
Dude...

287
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,946
If people could learn
to drive in this city!

288
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:01,019
I'm gonna call my lawyer friend,
all right? No, no, no.

289
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,083
Where you goin'?

290
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,288
I gotta tell Jules we're goin'.

291
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:07,695
What about that guy?

292
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:11,361
I caught the guy.
He talked, and I let him go.

293
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,163
All right.

294
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,356
You sure about this, Linc?

295
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,484
Look, the dude said the guys
are meeting a cop under this bridge.

296
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,427
Greer's got nothin'
to do with drugs, man.

297
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,896
He helped me get sober, you know?

298
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,336
Could you have parked
further away?

299
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,933
- Precautions, man.
- Paranoid, man.

300
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,688
Oh, my God.

301
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:41,089
It's Greer.

302
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,159
Oh, man.

303
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,293
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

304
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:58,501
I mean, I can't believe it.

305
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,318
Is that cocaine?

306
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,234
So, what do we do?

307
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,964
We gotta get
the hell out of here.

308
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,370
I'm not gonna just leave him here.

309
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,875
What are you talkin' about?
Let's go.

310
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:35,777
Wait, wait, wait.
We're cops, all right?

311
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,839
We're on the scene.
This is our job. All right?

312
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,351
We're not that kind of cops, man.

313
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:46,382
We gotta go now! Come on!

314
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,990
You all right?

315
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:25,654
I can't believe he's dead.

316
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:32,533
They're gonna think we were in on it.
They're gonna come for us.

317
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,129
Why would they come for us?

318
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:39,936
Because we're in the clubs, Pete.
We're his kids.

319
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,713
Greer wasn't like that.
It was a setup.

320
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,610
All right, look.

321
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,884
You were sick. We were giving you a lift
home. That's why we left the club.

322
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,322
Okay? All right?

323
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:55,723
Okay.

324
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,998
Show time.

325
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:22,644
I'm Detective Briggs, Internal Affairs.
I just got a few questions for you.

326
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,153
Okay.

327
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:27,521
- Tell me where you were tonight.
- I don't know.

328
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,753
We sent a car over to the club.

329
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,023
- None of you were there.
- Julie was sick.

330
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:34,587
- How are you doing, Julie?
- I'm all right.

331
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,691
- What was wrong?
- I don't know.

332
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:39,464
Do I look like a doctor?
I said she wasn't feeling well.

333
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:43,098
No, I was in the...
I was in the bar.

334
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,335
- No work tonight?
- I had an upset stomach...

335
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,004
so I left work early,
and Pete and Linc drove me home.

336
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,207
No, no, no.
I was outside the bar.

337
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:54,342
You guys must be gettin'
pretty tight.

338
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,320
- Not really.
- Not really?

339
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:00,619
Julie got sick in the bar,
and I had to take her home.

340
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:05,129
I went in the bar to get Linc,
'cause I can't drive Linc's...

341
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,654
- So you just took off?
- Eckford and Lanier, they left too.

342
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:11,566
- Where were Eckford and Lanier?
- I don't know.

343
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,633
- Ask me a question. Anything you want.
- Where were you when Greer got shot?

344
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,006
What?

345
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,511
- Greer's dead?
- Sorry.

346
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:26,573
Two shots to the chest.
It looked like something exploded.

347
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:29,984
You know what you're doin'? You're
tryin' to play on my emotions right now.

348
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:34,013
That's what you're tryin' to do.
I know this whole game.

349
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,219
I know...

350
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:40,060
- What do you know?
- I don't know anything.

351
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:42,599
Except that we found drugs
on the scene.

352
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,329
Cocaine. We're running tests.

353
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,861
We think it may be the stuff
from the evidence locker.

354
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,875
You look a little nervous, Pete.
Something you wanna tell me?

355
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:55,777
- You know anything about drugs, Julie?
- Enough to stay away.

356
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,610
Do I need to call a lawyer?

357
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:05,587
Not yet. But we may need you
for additional questioning...

358
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,023
so don't go anywhere.

359
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:17,726
- Were you crying?
- No!

360
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,895
How are you holding up?

361
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,769
We're fine.

362
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,139
Well, they're suspending the unit,
pending further investigation.

363
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:37,386
- What did Briggs tell you?
- Nothin'.

364
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:41,551
Our captain's dead, they don't know what
happened and they found drugs on him.

365
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,560
They think they're from
the evidence locker.

366
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,562
Every man's gotta
make a living, right?

367
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,064
Shut up.

368
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,600
You didn't even know him.
He was a great cop. Shut up!

369
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,343
A little too much coffee.

370
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,010
Oh, baby.

371
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:10,914
Look, um...

372
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,685
I'm gonna do what I can
to get you back on.

373
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:17,285
And I'm gonna do it because
it's what Adam Greer would've wanted.

374
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,762
But you're gonna have
to lay low...

375
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,925
for a while, so...

376
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,664
I can't believe I'm doin' this.

377
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:30,037
This is my address
and home phone.

378
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:34,370
If you need anything.

379
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,346
Thanks.

380
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,621
He was my friend.

381
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,592
Since when's he so friendly?

382
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:54,858
- Since maybe his best friend just died.
- So what.

383
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,832
So what?

384
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:01,970
- You're an asshole. Greer was...
- Greer was what?

385
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,407
You're actin' like this guy was
your best friend. He wasn't your daddy.

386
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:13,476
Fuck you! You guys wanna play like this
doesn't matter, like you don't care?

387
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,486
Fine, I'm out.

388
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,385
This is Billy. Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.

389
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:42,001
You ready to get
to the bottom of this?

390
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,576
What do you mean?

391
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,909
Well, for starters, we gotta
find that guy with the leather pants.

392
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:53,611
So, what... How do you think
we're gonna do that?

393
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,786
I know a friend of his.

394
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,022
- For me?
- Is what for you?

395
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,001
- The fish?
- For you.

396
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:13,696
Thank you.

397
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:15,534
Can I come in?

398
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,540
Yeah, I'm sorry. Of course.

399
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:21,271
- Your address was listed, so...
- I'm so proud to have one.

400
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:27,807
You sounded so depressed on the message.
I thought I'd come by and cheer you up.

401
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:29,750
Thank you.

402
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,851
God, I must look like shit.
I've been asleep all day.

403
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:37,986
- That's not possible.
- Yeah, actually.

404
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:46,360
- I'm sorry. Whoops.
- It's all right. It's okay.

405
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,107
That the perp's place, bro?

406
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:54,008
- Yeah.
- Stop, bro.

407
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:58,208
- Stop, stop.
- What?

408
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:00,978
I think I should drive in
and make the collar.

409
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,021
Are you crazy? Man, you're lucky
I let you ride in the car.

410
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:06,818
Dude, the guy knows
what you look like, all right?

411
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,256
So?

412
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,361
Dude, your cover's been blown,
all right?

413
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:15,661
Your cover's been blown.
Your cover has been blown. All right?

414
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,232
I gotta do it. That's it.

415
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:23,736
Dude, I'm gonna go in there
and I'm gonna bring him out.

416
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:29,041
Bro, I'm still under. I got it.

417
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,295
Oh, shit!

418
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:29,635
Shit! Shit!

419
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:33,909
Stop! Police!

420
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,634
Hey! Somebody grab that guy!

421
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,339
Grab that guy!

422
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,452
Goddamn it!

423
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,863
Look, I told you, man,
that's not even my stuff, okay?

424
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,959
It's some... What?

425
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,631
I was just giving Gilbert a ride
to meet some cop.

426
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:39,802
It was just a car pool situation.
That's not a crime. Just savin' gas.

427
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:50,378
Dude, I'm sorry about the car.
He was gettin' away.

428
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,388
I mean, what do you
want me to do?

429
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:58,152
- Dude, it's just water.
- Save it!

430
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,789
Look, where's leather pants live?

431
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,890
- Who?
- Gilbert O'Reilly.

432
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:05,162
Look, are you guys really cops?

433
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,364
- 'Cause my boss is just...
- Dude, we're undercover.

434
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,103
Really? What'd he do, anyway?

435
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,907
Dude, we think he killed
our boss, all right?

436
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,346
Would you shut up?

437
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,884
Yeah, shut up, man!

438
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,449
- You keep tickling me.
- Hold still! I gotta concentrate.

439
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:28,082
Come on!

440
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,787
- You're being... What're you doin'?
- I gotta go.

441
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:33,557
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do. I gotta go.

442
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:35,731
Why?

443
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,859
I gotta go meet my sponsor.

444
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,632
You're gonna wear my lipstick?

445
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:53,412
This is my address, okay?

446
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:59,953
And next week,
I'm gonna cook you dinner.

447
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:03,152
Since when do you know
how to cook?

448
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,161
I have a week. I'll learn.

449
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:09,832
- See you.
- See you.

450
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,950
- Watch the car.
- Sorry, man.

451
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:43,130
- Sure he lives here?
- Yeah.

452
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,660
You know, he's a surfer guy,
so he likes to be near the water.

453
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,330
Knock?

454
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:58,246
I don't think he's home.

455
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:00,647
Stand back. Stand back!

456
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:04,381
Oh, shit.
What the hell is wrong with you, man?

457
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,616
- Bro, stand back.
- Where'd you get that from?

458
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,056
Dude, it's my dad's.

459
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:12,027
Oh, yeah.
You know how to use it?

460
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:14,121
Bro, you just point and shoot.

461
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,826
Look, just don't point
and shoot at me.

462
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:19,961
You know what? No guns, okay?

463
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,800
- Guns are bad.
- Shut up!

464
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,363
- I know a guy once...
- Shut up!

465
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:29,202
Do a perimeter search, all right?
Cover me.

466
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,771
- With what?
- Cover me.

467
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,905
Are you nuts?

468
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,510
All right.

469
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,946
What do we do now?

470
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:09,776
- We wait.
- Cops wait.

471
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,235
Hello?

472
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,247
I think I have the wrong number.

473
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:24,494
- Hello?
- Who's this?

474
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:27,758
- Who's this?
- Who's this?

475
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,231
I told you not to pick up
the fuckin' phone!

476
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:44,405
Hello. Yellow Cab.

477
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:46,949
Can I get a cab
over at Hollywood and Vine?

478
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:59,729
- Pull over here.
- All right.

479
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,457
Here you go.

480
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,335
Well?

481
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:15,737
- Hold on. Wait a second.
- All right.

482
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:33,989
Follow that Caddie.

483
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,588
You got it.

484
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:15,964
- Here you go.
- Keep the change.

485
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:51,131
Come on.
Do some business with me.

486
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,233
Do you see I'm busy?

487
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,288
- Leave me alone.
- It'll just take a couple minutes.

488
00:46:55,312 --> 00:47:00,750
I'll leave you alone as soon as we deal
with this in the back with some privacy.

489
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:04,879
- You're driving me crazy.
- All right. Shut up!

490
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:07,924
I love you, sweetheart.
You know, you're a pain in the ass.

491
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,925
- Come on.
- You're a pain in the ass!

492
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:13,258
Yeah, but you love me. I'm a pain
in the ass, but you love my ass.

493
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:38,481
You're making me laugh.
You wanna make a big deal with me?

494
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,489
I know you got something
goin' down...

495
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,491
with one of your bands and drugs...

496
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,392
You leave the fuckin' boys
outta this!

497
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:47,396
- They can really rock and roll.
- What?

498
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:50,627
This is a joke, right?
You are a pimp, Billy.

499
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,966
A pimp. You do drugs.
That doesn't mean you should sell 'em.

500
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,130
Just say no, man.

501
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,972
Just tell me when and where it's goin'
down and I will bring the cash, okay?

502
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:03,740
You wanna be a big shot?
You wanna make the big fuckin' deal?

503
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:07,250
Okay, you're in. But you better not
mess with me or I'll crush your balls.

504
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:10,980
- I would not mess with you.
- Or the band. They really got a future.

505
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:14,046
- Okay, okay. Can I use your phone?
- Who are you gonna call?

506
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:16,684
I'm gonna call the cops, Howard.

507
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,228
Funny, very funny.
Keep it local.

508
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:30,268
Bob? Hey. Yeah,
I just talked to him. Deal's set.

509
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:35,334
You relax, Bob. None of them have
any idea that I know they're cops.

510
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,609
Especially her. Look,
I'm her goddamn dream man, okay?

511
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:42,243
No, you listen to me! If you wanna have
somebody else take a shot...

512
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,753
like Tricky or one of
the other men in blue that...

513
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,218
The what? All right.

514
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:52,694
I gotta go. Something's come up.

515
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,425
I gotta go. Bye.

516
00:48:56,967 --> 00:49:00,266
- Wow.
- Hi, baby.

517
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:02,202
- Is this for me?
- Mm-hmm.

518
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,297
Really? Come here.

519
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:42,511
Dude, I think there's something
down there, bro.

520
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,604
- What?
- I don't know. Wait!

521
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,774
I hear some voices down there.

522
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:50,183
- It's the ocean.
- Wait. No, listen.

523
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,854
Get back in the car.

524
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:57,655
Get back in the car.
No, I will shoot you.

525
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:00,788
- Get back in the car.
- All right.

526
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,800
Let's go.

527
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:23,043
Be quiet, Gilbert. All right?

528
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,020
Sit down!

529
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:30,517
Bye, Gilbert.

530
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:01,052
Man, I thought I told you, no guns.

531
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:17,906
My ankle! Shit!

532
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,713
Oh, Jesus. Who's this?

533
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:29,718
- Beats me.
- Come on.

534
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:32,220
Let's dump him in the trailer
with Gilbert.

535
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,007
I gotta go.
I gotta get out of here.

536
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,013
All right?

537
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:02,674
- Where are you goin', man?
- I don't know, man.

538
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:06,779
I just gotta go, all right?
What are you gonna do, hit me?

539
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:13,260
- Yeah, right.
- Don't be stupid, Pete.

540
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:18,394
You're callin' me stupid?

541
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:23,667
I got a fucked up ankle.
I got brain and blood all over my body.

542
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:27,267
And I'm fuckin' stupid.
You know what? Fuck you!

543
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:33,079
You know what, man?
You wanna leave? Go ahead, my man.

544
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,084
Matter of fact, take my keys.

545
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,279
I don't give a shit.

546
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:29,028
His head just exploded, like,
all over the place, all over everything.

547
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:32,591
All over my clothes, my face,
all over...

548
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:36,935
And then I dropped Linc off at home...

549
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:40,773
and then I left, you know,
and I just...

550
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:45,110
I needed someone to talk to
about this whole situation.

551
00:54:56,122 --> 00:54:58,283
I don't want that anymore.

552
00:54:59,692 --> 00:55:01,626
Tough night, Pete.

553
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:05,654
It's gonna be okay.

554
00:55:05,731 --> 00:55:09,098
I want you to go home,
and I want you to get some rest.

555
00:55:11,304 --> 00:55:15,570
I'm gonna take care of this for you.
I don't know how, but I'm gonna do it.

556
00:55:15,641 --> 00:55:21,443
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you so early.

557
00:55:21,514 --> 00:55:25,883
I hope I didn't wake you up
or disturb your wife or anything.

558
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,421
My wife.

559
00:55:35,595 --> 00:55:39,053
So did you get a look
at these two guys? Hello.

560
00:55:39,131 --> 00:55:40,496
- Yeah.
- What?

561
00:55:40,566 --> 00:55:42,932
What did they look like? Yeah.

562
00:55:43,002 --> 00:55:46,870
I never said that there were two...

563
00:55:46,939 --> 00:55:50,705
No, no. All right.
Have a good time.

564
00:55:50,776 --> 00:55:53,506
No, I think it was too dark...

565
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:55,171
for me to see anything.

566
00:55:55,248 --> 00:55:58,547
Listen. I have to take this call
in the other room.

567
00:55:58,618 --> 00:56:00,017
It's my wife.

568
00:56:00,086 --> 00:56:02,611
Oh, yeah.

569
00:56:05,391 --> 00:56:09,487
Can't you understand I'm tied up?

570
00:56:09,562 --> 00:56:13,794
Not here.
Am I speaking French to you?

571
00:56:32,652 --> 00:56:34,483
What the hell? Not the yard!

572
00:57:42,788 --> 00:57:46,554
- Hey, leave a message after the beep.
- Hey, Linc, you didn't say our na...

573
00:57:46,626 --> 00:57:49,493
Linc, if you get this message,
do not go back to the apartment.

574
00:57:49,562 --> 00:57:51,587
There's cops all over the place.

575
00:57:51,664 --> 00:57:55,259
Just meet me and Julie down at that
place at the beach tomorrow morning.

576
00:58:07,346 --> 00:58:09,280
Hi, Mom.

577
00:58:14,787 --> 00:58:16,778
What's happened to you?

578
00:58:20,226 --> 00:58:24,856
Well, you know,
things are pretty fucked up, Ma.

579
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:27,057
Don't use that foul language with me.

580
00:58:27,133 --> 00:58:29,693
Who is it, honey?

581
00:58:32,104 --> 00:58:34,231
Hi, Dad.

582
00:58:35,374 --> 00:58:36,636
What do you want?

583
00:58:39,812 --> 00:58:42,906
Let me get you
some clean clothes, okay?

584
00:58:49,955 --> 00:58:52,048
Well, I was...

585
00:58:52,124 --> 00:58:55,287
- I was just... You know, I just...
- We're not bailing you out.

586
00:58:56,929 --> 00:59:00,023
What? What do you mean,
you're not bailing me out?

587
00:59:00,099 --> 00:59:02,761
The police already came by.

588
00:59:02,835 --> 00:59:06,931
What? No, no.
The police are in on it, Dad.

589
00:59:07,006 --> 00:59:09,839
- Come on. Save it.
- No, listen to me. Just for a second.

590
00:59:09,909 --> 00:59:12,639
I'm a police officer now, Dad.

591
00:59:12,712 --> 00:59:15,476
- Oh, you're a police officer?
- Yes, I'm a police officer.

592
00:59:15,548 --> 00:59:18,517
Here we go.
Some clean clothes, honey.

593
00:59:18,584 --> 00:59:22,384
- Now clean up. You're a mess.
- I don't need clean clothes right now.

594
00:59:22,455 --> 00:59:25,083
- They're his.
- Officer Pete?

595
00:59:27,226 --> 00:59:29,820
Why are you laughing at me?

596
00:59:32,465 --> 00:59:35,866
Officer Pete. Betty,
you know, at least he got a haircut.

597
00:59:35,935 --> 00:59:39,701
Maybe when they make him captain,
they'll give him a uniform.

598
00:59:39,772 --> 00:59:42,172
Why don't you just
give him a chance?

599
01:00:13,172 --> 01:00:15,606
I'm sorry about your guy.

600
01:00:21,881 --> 01:00:24,645
He wasn't my guy.

601
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:29,954
Well, I guess not.

602
01:00:31,023 --> 01:00:32,957
He's a pimp.

603
01:00:35,327 --> 01:00:37,261
He's not sober.

604
01:00:40,432 --> 01:00:43,629
And on the phone he was saying
something about Tricky.

605
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:49,335
The guy was playing with me
the entire time.

606
01:01:05,024 --> 01:01:07,356
Well, I think everything's
gonna be okay.

607
01:01:10,529 --> 01:01:12,463
You think?

608
01:01:13,866 --> 01:01:15,993
It just feels good to say it.

609
01:01:46,866 --> 01:01:49,232
- Good night.
- Good night.

610
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:04,842
If you need to go to a meeting...

611
01:02:04,917 --> 01:02:07,442
tomorrow morning...

612
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:12,047
then I can go down
to the pier by myself.

613
01:02:12,124 --> 01:02:14,058
No, it's okay.

614
01:02:15,628 --> 01:02:17,061
Thanks.

615
01:02:52,331 --> 01:02:54,265
Would you just hold me?

616
01:03:10,249 --> 01:03:12,183
Thanks for being here.

617
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:16,954
You too.

618
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:34,201
Damn, Sonny, what took you so long?
I was waitin' out there forever.

619
01:03:34,273 --> 01:03:37,640
What, I don't get no
"Hello. I miss you.

620
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:42,113
Sorry I didn't call your ass
until I needed some shit"?

621
01:03:42,181 --> 01:03:44,342
What happened to you?
What's with the fishin' hat?

622
01:03:45,517 --> 01:03:47,849
I'm tryin' to stay
on the undercover, man.

623
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,880
Penitentiary life ain't good
for a brother, is it?

624
01:03:49,922 --> 01:03:51,856
You got the info or what, man?

625
01:03:51,924 --> 01:03:54,552
Your man Gilbert O'Reilly was dealin'.

626
01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:56,821
What you mean "was"?

627
01:03:56,895 --> 01:04:01,662
It was on the news. They found him at
the beach with another dude, both dead.

628
01:04:01,734 --> 01:04:05,727
Cops said it was a murder-suicide.
I think it was some S-M shit myself.

629
01:04:06,805 --> 01:04:09,035
All right, look, Sonny, man.

630
01:04:09,108 --> 01:04:11,633
I'm gonna need to borrow your car.

631
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:14,838
Hell, no. You might be named
after Lincoln who freed the slaves...

632
01:04:14,913 --> 01:04:17,381
but I ain't about
to free my wheels up, man.

633
01:04:17,449 --> 01:04:20,077
I got some shit goin' down tonight.

634
01:04:20,152 --> 01:04:22,586
I could use a partner
like the old days, you know?

635
01:04:22,654 --> 01:04:26,112
- Don't waste your breath.
- You know you can run now.

636
01:04:26,191 --> 01:04:29,183
- Sonny.
- Track star!

637
01:04:29,261 --> 01:04:33,027
Just consider this my way of keeping
your skinny ass out of a life of crime.

638
01:04:33,098 --> 01:04:35,362
Don't save me
from a life of crime, man.

639
01:04:35,434 --> 01:04:37,766
Crime pays. Well.

640
01:04:52,518 --> 01:04:54,850
Did you ever break-dance
when you were in school?

641
01:04:57,656 --> 01:05:00,625
- I imagine you did, though.
- I can break-dance.

642
01:05:06,231 --> 01:05:07,664
Disgusting.

643
01:05:10,169 --> 01:05:14,162
I'm like a ladies' man.
I love to dance.

644
01:05:18,911 --> 01:05:20,879
Knock it off.

645
01:05:20,946 --> 01:05:22,573
- What?
- Looking.

646
01:05:22,648 --> 01:05:24,582
Oh, come on.

647
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:53,977
Oh, man!
What did you do to my car, man?

648
01:05:54,046 --> 01:05:56,640
- Oh, shit.
- Look at this.

649
01:05:56,715 --> 01:05:58,675
- What did you do to my goddamn car?
- Linc, wait.

650
01:05:58,717 --> 01:06:03,245
Wait. Okay. Just don't say anything
for a second. Let me just explain it.

651
01:06:03,322 --> 01:06:07,759
Let me just explain it,
all right?

652
01:06:07,826 --> 01:06:13,230
- He said something about a big deal.
- Jules, it makes total sense, man.

653
01:06:13,298 --> 01:06:15,232
Last night
I stopped in on a friend.

654
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:17,734
Got the car, some clothes,
and I got some information.

655
01:06:17,803 --> 01:06:20,135
Turns out that Gilbert
was Tricky's snitch.

656
01:06:20,205 --> 01:06:22,173
Here you go.

657
01:06:22,241 --> 01:06:26,007
I didn't know if you wanted cream
or half and half or sugar or Equal or...

658
01:06:26,078 --> 01:06:29,536
Black's fine. It's fine.

659
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:32,083
- All right.
- Did I miss something?

660
01:06:36,155 --> 01:06:39,022
- You sure?
- Yes.

661
01:06:39,091 --> 01:06:41,855
Check it out.
All right. Here's what we got.

662
01:06:41,927 --> 01:06:44,725
Now Billy's workin' something,
runnin' with the men in blue.

663
01:06:44,796 --> 01:06:46,774
And Gilbert definitely
didn't take out the bald guy...

664
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:48,857
so he probably
didn't cap himself either.

665
01:06:48,934 --> 01:06:52,165
So since Gilbert was Tricky's snitch,
he's hooked in too.

666
01:06:52,237 --> 01:06:54,215
And whoever stole the drugs
from the evidence locker...

667
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:55,706
was trying to frame Captain Greer.

668
01:06:55,774 --> 01:06:58,766
Wait. No, I didn't hear
anything you guys just said.

669
01:06:58,844 --> 01:07:01,608
The cops, man... Tricky,
Eckford, Lanier, the whole gang...

670
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,705
They're all into something.

671
01:07:03,782 --> 01:07:06,945
No. Mothershed. When I was at his house,
he said there were two guys.

672
01:07:07,019 --> 01:07:09,954
- And I never even said that.
- Yeah, right.

673
01:07:10,022 --> 01:07:14,322
Whatever they got goin' got something
to do with Billy, Gilbert and drugs.

674
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:21,160
This is like one of those dirty cop
drug things. This shit really happens?

675
01:07:21,233 --> 01:07:23,360
- Looks that way.
- And Greer was onto him.

676
01:07:23,435 --> 01:07:26,666
That's why there was all
that secret stuff before he died.

677
01:07:29,741 --> 01:07:31,675
That's why he died.

678
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:38,213
He was trying to protect us.

679
01:07:38,283 --> 01:07:39,716
Yeah.

680
01:07:40,986 --> 01:07:42,920
So what now?

681
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:48,748
You know, we need to get some evidence.
We need some evidence.

682
01:07:49,828 --> 01:07:52,729
Just trust me. They all
gotta meet up and go over the plan.

683
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:54,891
- Really?
- Look, these stupid motherfuckers...

684
01:07:54,967 --> 01:07:56,901
are nothin' if not predictable, man.

685
01:07:58,937 --> 01:08:02,395
- So how long do we do this?
- Till something happens.

686
01:08:03,575 --> 01:08:07,841
Is this all that cops do...
Sit around in cars, waiting?

687
01:08:07,913 --> 01:08:09,847
We can go get some doughnuts.

688
01:08:17,055 --> 01:08:18,989
I gotta pee.

689
01:08:31,703 --> 01:08:32,965
What did I tell you?

690
01:08:33,038 --> 01:08:35,700
Looks like that's all of 'em.

691
01:08:37,576 --> 01:08:40,067
- I'm goin' in.
- What?

692
01:08:40,145 --> 01:08:42,238
Pete, your ankle's all messed up.

693
01:08:42,314 --> 01:08:44,077
I'm good at this. Don't worry.

694
01:08:44,149 --> 01:08:45,707
We'll all go.

695
01:08:45,784 --> 01:08:47,843
No. It's too much noise.
Don't worry about it.

696
01:08:47,919 --> 01:08:50,888
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I got it.

697
01:08:54,626 --> 01:08:57,117
You really think
he can pull this off?

698
01:08:58,597 --> 01:09:00,656
That's it. We don't want
no more to do with this.

699
01:09:00,732 --> 01:09:02,700
Come on, Carl.
Don't be such a pussy.

700
01:09:02,768 --> 01:09:04,793
- Don't call me a pussy.
- Fuck you, motherfucker.

701
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:07,100
- See what this thing is doing to us?
- What?

702
01:09:07,172 --> 01:09:11,268
- We out of here.
- Ah, shit. Come on, Carl. Come here.

703
01:09:11,343 --> 01:09:14,403
- This was supposed to be about drugs.
- Two people are dead.

704
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:16,879
- Three.
- What?

705
01:09:16,948 --> 01:09:20,543
- The bald guy at Gilbert's.
- Couldn't be helped.

706
01:09:20,619 --> 01:09:22,917
Look, Gilbert was an asshole.

707
01:09:22,988 --> 01:09:24,922
Almost gettin' arrested
at the bust...

708
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:27,618
not stayin' away after we fired him,
talkin' to Greer.

709
01:09:27,693 --> 01:09:29,320
Little shit deserved to die.

710
01:09:29,394 --> 01:09:33,626
- Why did you have to kill Greer?
- He knew about us and the drugs, okay?

711
01:09:33,699 --> 01:09:35,633
Got in the way.

712
01:09:36,702 --> 01:09:39,967
- This is bad. I want out.
- Yeah, me too.

713
01:09:40,038 --> 01:09:42,063
It's too late for that, Carl.

714
01:09:44,242 --> 01:09:45,675
Come on.

715
01:09:49,448 --> 01:09:51,439
This is our lives, asshole.

716
01:09:51,516 --> 01:09:54,849
Now, you wanna get in our way,
you take your best shot.

717
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,115
But I ain't guaranteein'
where you'll end up.

718
01:09:57,189 --> 01:10:00,420
Ernie, come on.
Put it down, man.

719
01:10:00,492 --> 01:10:02,084
We're all in this to the end, right?

720
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:05,926
If this deal goes through,
we're set for life. Come on.

721
01:10:08,166 --> 01:10:10,100
So what's the plan?

722
01:10:10,168 --> 01:10:12,136
Over here. I'm wet. Come on.

723
01:10:13,205 --> 01:10:15,332
All right. Here it is.

724
01:10:15,407 --> 01:10:19,002
Billy set up a big deal
with this rock manager Howard.

725
01:10:19,077 --> 01:10:21,511
- You sure we can trust this Billy guy?
- Yeah.

726
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:24,549
He did a good job sellin' the drugs
after we got rid of Gilbert.

727
01:10:24,616 --> 01:10:26,743
And this new deal is his idea anyhow.

728
01:10:26,818 --> 01:10:29,844
You see, this Howard guy...
He's got some famous rock band...

729
01:10:29,921 --> 01:10:31,980
flyin' in,
and the drugs are on the plane.

730
01:10:32,057 --> 01:10:36,517
- Who's the band?
- How should I know who the band is?

731
01:10:36,595 --> 01:10:38,529
It's just voices on a tape, man.

732
01:10:38,597 --> 01:10:41,532
To hell with voices on a tape.
We bring this to IA. That's it.

733
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,194
Pete, Linc's right.
They're not gonna believe it.

734
01:10:44,269 --> 01:10:48,365
Look. We can't trust anybody,
all right? It's just us.

735
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,374
Oh, God.

736
01:10:53,311 --> 01:10:55,404
Okay, so... Then, wh...

737
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,641
Sorry. What do you wanna do?

738
01:10:57,716 --> 01:10:59,650
I know where the rock manager lives.

739
01:10:59,718 --> 01:11:02,209
We have to find out when
and where it's happening.

740
01:11:02,287 --> 01:11:05,882
Fine. I'll go over there, I'll get tight
with them, and I'll find out something.

741
01:11:05,957 --> 01:11:09,723
You can't do that, 'cause if Billy's
there, you're dead. He can make us.

742
01:11:09,795 --> 01:11:11,729
I got Billy.

743
01:11:13,665 --> 01:11:16,896
- Are you sure?
- Anybody got a better idea?

744
01:11:16,968 --> 01:11:19,232
Then I got your back, Julie.

745
01:11:19,304 --> 01:11:20,896
All right.

746
01:11:20,972 --> 01:11:25,238
Leave a message at home and let us know
what's goin' on, all right?

747
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:29,440
All right. Let's do it.

748
01:11:47,632 --> 01:11:50,192
Where you been? I called your house.
I called the club.

749
01:11:50,268 --> 01:11:52,759
- They said you're not working anymore.
- I quit.

750
01:11:54,973 --> 01:11:57,032
I'm not a very good waitress.

751
01:11:57,108 --> 01:11:59,941
What happened?
Did I do something wrong?

752
01:12:00,011 --> 01:12:04,311
No, everything's fine.
No, I was looking for you too.

753
01:12:04,382 --> 01:12:06,282
You were lookin' for me too?

754
01:12:06,351 --> 01:12:08,444
Yeah.

755
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:11,114
Well, here I am.

756
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:40,884
What?

757
01:12:40,952 --> 01:12:43,477
Says Billy sent him over.

758
01:12:43,555 --> 01:12:46,888
There. Sit down.
Oh, I'm so sorry about the mess.

759
01:12:46,958 --> 01:12:50,917
- I'm redecorating. Yeah?
- I know you told me to stay in there.

760
01:12:52,097 --> 01:12:53,689
Can I get a soda?

761
01:12:54,933 --> 01:12:57,663
- Soda. I'm thirsty.
- You're thirsty.

762
01:13:00,338 --> 01:13:03,068
I'm sorry.
My little baby is thirsty.

763
01:13:03,141 --> 01:13:05,075
Come here.

764
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:11,374
I'm sorry. This is not
gonna take very long, okay?

765
01:13:11,449 --> 01:13:15,078
All right. You go ahead.
You go get yourself a fuckin' sodie.

766
01:13:18,924 --> 01:13:20,619
Not bad, huh?

767
01:13:20,692 --> 01:13:23,490
You want a fuckin' sodie too?

768
01:13:23,562 --> 01:13:26,759
- I'm cool.
- Yes.

769
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:30,627
Yes, you are.

770
01:13:31,536 --> 01:13:33,868
You are cool, aren't you?

771
01:13:37,342 --> 01:13:39,276
So?

772
01:13:40,178 --> 01:13:43,978
You're movin' a lot of shit.
Billy thought you might need some help.

773
01:13:47,786 --> 01:13:50,949
Sweet little Billy.
But nice to know he cares.

774
01:13:58,063 --> 01:13:59,997
Okay, now.

775
01:14:00,065 --> 01:14:02,158
If I'm out of line here,
you just let me know, okay?

776
01:14:02,233 --> 01:14:04,758
Or storm off or do whatever.

777
01:14:06,638 --> 01:14:08,572
I got us a room.

778
01:14:13,812 --> 01:14:15,973
Right on.

779
01:14:19,451 --> 01:14:21,442
- Could I borrow the phone?
- Sure.

780
01:14:21,519 --> 01:14:24,215
Just dial nine to get out.

781
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:34,310
- Leave a message after the beep.
- Hey, Linc, you didn't say our...

782
01:14:36,434 --> 01:14:40,200
- You have no messages.
- Thank you.

783
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:01,588
Wanna dance?

784
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:04,390
What?

785
01:15:05,463 --> 01:15:06,725
Come on.

786
01:15:06,798 --> 01:15:08,732
Dance with me.

787
01:15:11,536 --> 01:15:13,470
I love this song.

788
01:15:14,973 --> 01:15:17,237
Come on.
It's just a little dance.

789
01:15:17,308 --> 01:15:19,970
I'm not a fag.
I just like to dance.

790
01:15:20,045 --> 01:15:24,141
Uh, you lead.
I'll be the girl. Yeah.

791
01:15:35,226 --> 01:15:38,161
I should get goin', man.
I got some business to handle.

792
01:15:38,229 --> 01:15:40,959
You're a classy dancer,
you know that?

793
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,331
Oh, I'm sorry. Wait a minute.

794
01:15:44,402 --> 01:15:46,336
I forgot. What's your name?

795
01:15:50,275 --> 01:15:52,334
Spin me, Linc.

796
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:54,241
What?

797
01:15:54,312 --> 01:15:56,974
I said spin me.

798
01:16:06,891 --> 01:16:08,825
We could enter a contest.

799
01:16:11,429 --> 01:16:14,455
You can ride with us
in the morning, okay?

800
01:16:14,532 --> 01:16:16,466
Come on.

801
01:16:44,863 --> 01:16:47,331
Okay, I got it.
Agua Dulce Airport.

802
01:16:47,398 --> 01:16:49,730
Yeah. Don't worry about it.
Bob, she's fine.

803
01:16:49,801 --> 01:16:52,065
She doesn't know a thing.
Don't worry about it.

804
01:16:54,472 --> 01:16:56,406
You fuckin' woke her up, man.

805
01:17:52,964 --> 01:17:55,228
I didn't do him, okay?

806
01:18:02,707 --> 01:18:04,641
What about Linc?

807
01:18:06,578 --> 01:18:08,705
Oh, he didn't leave a message.

808
01:18:10,748 --> 01:18:12,773
We gotta go.

809
01:18:12,851 --> 01:18:14,819
Are you sure about that?

810
01:18:14,886 --> 01:18:17,354
I overheard him say that
on the phone in the bathroom.

811
01:18:17,422 --> 01:18:21,119
And that piece of paper I found
in his pants said Aqua Dulce Airport.

812
01:18:21,192 --> 01:18:23,820
Jesus. Dirty cops,
drops at the airport.

813
01:18:23,895 --> 01:18:26,921
I feel like one of us should say
we're gettin' too old for this shit.

814
01:18:26,998 --> 01:18:29,865
At least it's not goin' down
in an abandoned warehouse.

815
01:18:32,804 --> 01:18:34,738
Yeah.

816
01:18:46,985 --> 01:18:49,749
You gotta hear these guys.
They can really rock, man.

817
01:18:49,821 --> 01:18:51,982
I mean, this band
can rock and roll.

818
01:18:52,056 --> 01:18:53,990
These boys are the bomb.

819
01:19:20,285 --> 01:19:22,583
All right.
I'm gonna go make a phone call.

820
01:19:22,654 --> 01:19:24,884
- What?
- Just stay here, all right?

821
01:19:31,829 --> 01:19:34,263
Let's go greet the fuckin' kids.

822
01:19:38,736 --> 01:19:41,569
Be nice to the boys, okay?

823
01:19:44,909 --> 01:19:49,175
- Hey! Kevin, how are you, baby?
- Howie!

824
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:52,512
Hey, Kirk! Kris, how you doin', babe?
How are you?

825
01:19:52,583 --> 01:19:55,484
Oh, come on! Will ya pl...

826
01:19:55,553 --> 01:20:00,855
Hey, will you turn down the tunes
a scootch, please? Thanks. Listen, boys.

827
01:20:02,293 --> 01:20:04,227
Big people got some biz here.

828
01:20:04,295 --> 01:20:06,661
So why don't you hop into the limo...

829
01:20:06,731 --> 01:20:09,199
scoot over to the hotel,
we'll catch up with you later.

830
01:20:09,267 --> 01:20:12,964
- Come on. Can't we stay with you?
- Come on. Be good, boys.

831
01:20:13,037 --> 01:20:15,471
- We won't do anything.
- Give us a hug. Come on.

832
01:20:18,242 --> 01:20:21,336
- Go ahead. Go!
- Bye!

833
01:20:21,412 --> 01:20:22,845
See you at the hotel.

834
01:20:22,914 --> 01:20:25,542
- Don't be long.
- We missed you.

835
01:21:00,151 --> 01:21:02,085
Where the hell is that schmuck?

836
01:21:03,888 --> 01:21:06,914
Where'd you go?

837
01:21:06,991 --> 01:21:09,425
I called for backup.

838
01:21:09,494 --> 01:21:11,223
- What's goin' on?
- Linc's inside.

839
01:21:14,832 --> 01:21:17,926
God, that almost is
an abandoned warehouse.

840
01:21:18,002 --> 01:21:20,436
I'm gettin' too old for this shit.

841
01:21:47,165 --> 01:21:50,623
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

842
01:21:50,701 --> 01:21:53,602
Oh, God. Okay.

843
01:21:58,042 --> 01:22:00,977
- Hey, you guys got a bathroom in here?
- Over there.

844
01:22:17,995 --> 01:22:20,828
- You're late.
- Sorry. I had to rent a car, man.

845
01:22:20,898 --> 01:22:23,298
Someone stole mine
from your party the other night.

846
01:22:23,367 --> 01:22:26,393
What do we do?

847
01:22:28,172 --> 01:22:29,867
- Let's go.
- What? Where?

848
01:22:29,941 --> 01:22:32,273
Get the car. Come on. Let's go.

849
01:22:37,448 --> 01:22:40,508
- Oh, God.
- You want me to drive?

850
01:22:40,585 --> 01:22:42,985
No. Linc wouldn't want you
driving his car.

851
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:51,026
So, do we do this now...

852
01:22:51,095 --> 01:22:53,825
or do we wait for your boyfriend
to come out of the toilet?

853
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:56,757
What?

854
01:22:58,703 --> 01:23:02,969
Your fella. He's a good dancer.

855
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:08,205
Dancer? I don't know no dancer.
Are you serious?

856
01:23:11,215 --> 01:23:13,877
I don't know what the fuck
you're talkin' about.

857
01:23:13,951 --> 01:23:18,285
Uh-huh. No, brother's not with me.

858
01:23:19,357 --> 01:23:21,723
- He's a cop.
- What?

859
01:23:24,095 --> 01:23:27,064
- Stop messin' around.
- You'll know when I am. He's a cop!

860
01:23:27,131 --> 01:23:28,792
- Police!
- Freeze!

861
01:23:28,866 --> 01:23:31,391
- Drop the weapons!
- Drop 'em!

862
01:23:31,469 --> 01:23:33,403
- Right now! Drop 'em!
- Put 'em down!

863
01:23:33,471 --> 01:23:35,132
Down!

864
01:23:35,206 --> 01:23:36,639
Drop 'em! Get 'em out of here!

865
01:23:36,707 --> 01:23:39,642
- Come on, big man.
- Hey, this is fucked up.

866
01:23:39,710 --> 01:23:41,974
Faster.

867
01:23:45,082 --> 01:23:46,709
Teamwork.

868
01:23:46,784 --> 01:23:50,811
Let's go. Get out of here.
You too, home skillet.

869
01:23:50,888 --> 01:23:52,913
On the wall.

870
01:23:55,359 --> 01:23:56,986
Spread 'em!

871
01:24:00,831 --> 01:24:02,765
You dead, boy.

872
01:24:11,175 --> 01:24:12,836
Stop!

873
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:14,400
Is that Eckford?

874
01:24:14,478 --> 01:24:17,242
- He better move.
- Right on.

875
01:24:23,854 --> 01:24:25,287
- Jump!
- What?

876
01:24:25,356 --> 01:24:27,483
Jump!

877
01:24:27,558 --> 01:24:30,925
- Oh, my God! My ankle!
- Get away from the door!

878
01:25:08,432 --> 01:25:11,526
Hey, kid, I don't think
you're gonna make it.

879
01:25:22,146 --> 01:25:24,580
- Fuck this fair fighting shit.
- Okay.

880
01:26:00,484 --> 01:26:02,076
- You okay?
- Yeah, man.

881
01:26:02,153 --> 01:26:03,620
Gotta go.

882
01:26:03,688 --> 01:26:05,383
I got a plan.

883
01:26:21,772 --> 01:26:23,706
Does this mean
you're mad at me again?

884
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:31,413
You gonna kill him?

885
01:26:33,317 --> 01:26:34,750
No, I'm done.

886
01:26:45,663 --> 01:26:47,790
Hey, what are you doing, huh?

887
01:26:47,865 --> 01:26:49,976
I've got nothing to do with drugs.
I'm in the music business!

888
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,198
Hey, get this place taped off. You're
standing around like crossing guards.

889
01:27:03,781 --> 01:27:07,808
- Save me a dance, lover.
- What happened, Detective?

890
01:27:07,885 --> 01:27:12,379
Well, sir. We were bustin' 'em, and
these kids came in and tried to stop us.

891
01:27:12,456 --> 01:27:14,447
- That's bullshit.
- They tried to stop you?

892
01:27:14,525 --> 01:27:16,857
Yes, sir. Probably in on it too.

893
01:27:16,927 --> 01:27:20,124
- They set this up.
- They stole drugs from the evidence.

894
01:27:20,197 --> 01:27:23,462
- That's enough. Get 'em out of here.
- They killed Greer. He was onto them.

895
01:27:23,534 --> 01:27:24,865
Ask him.

896
01:27:26,837 --> 01:27:29,362
I have no idea
what she's talking about.

897
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,600
Ask him.

898
01:27:35,179 --> 01:27:40,708
Right before Billy hands over the cash,
we roll in and make the bust, okay?

899
01:27:40,785 --> 01:27:45,188
- Where are we gonna get that money?
- Carl, there is no money, okay?

900
01:27:45,256 --> 01:27:48,817
It's an empty bag.
We bust in before Billy hands it over.

901
01:27:48,893 --> 01:27:51,088
Anybody have any questions?
It's all pretty easy.

902
01:27:51,162 --> 01:27:53,756
We grab the drugs,
pretend to arrest Billy...

903
01:27:53,831 --> 01:27:57,198
next day he's out moving
the stuff for us, okay?

904
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:01,595
Yeah, Bob!

905
01:28:06,343 --> 01:28:08,834
Assume the position.

906
01:28:11,415 --> 01:28:13,349
Assume it.

907
01:28:19,723 --> 01:28:21,657
You all right?

908
01:28:22,726 --> 01:28:25,889
- Yeah, are you?
- Yeah.

909
01:28:25,963 --> 01:28:27,396
You?

910
01:28:29,633 --> 01:28:31,225
Yeah.

911
01:28:33,070 --> 01:28:35,538
Nice work.

912
01:28:35,606 --> 01:28:37,733
Thank you.

913
01:28:37,808 --> 01:28:40,276
So you kids are what...

914
01:28:40,344 --> 01:28:42,869
some kind of "mod squad"
or something?

915
01:28:54,758 --> 01:28:57,989
They say we're back on
if we want.

916
01:28:58,062 --> 01:29:01,691
- Yes.
- Won't be the same without Greer.

917
01:29:05,736 --> 01:29:07,670
What else we got?

918
01:29:12,076 --> 01:29:15,341
- So what? Are we in or...
- Right on.

919
01:29:16,981 --> 01:29:18,414
Solid.

920
01:29:22,353 --> 01:29:25,220
Oh, Linc, dude.
I know a guy down in Torrance...

921
01:29:25,289 --> 01:29:28,315
who is, like, the straight up wizard
of bondo.

922
01:29:28,392 --> 01:29:30,724
- And I'm sure he could fix up the car...
- Shut up, Pete.

923
01:29:30,794 --> 01:29:33,888
No, wait. I'm serious, dude.
