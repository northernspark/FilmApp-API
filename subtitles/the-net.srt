{1693}{1780}There's no chance a mistake|could've been made? A misreading?
{1782}{1845}Human error? It happens.
{1847}{1950}Oh. Well, that sort of|rules that out then, doesn't it?
{1951}{2014}So this really is reality.

{5881}{5950}This is a very dynamic game,|Mr. Dapina.
{5951}{6030}You can be honest, Angela.|This game is as bloody as it gets.
{6031}{6088}Believe me,|the kids will eat this up.
{6090}{6151}First, tell me what keeps crashing|the damn thing.
{6230}{6349}You have been virused, Mr. Dapina,|and a not so very nice one.

{6715}{6775}That's what they all say.|Did you install it?
{6777}{6854}Absolutely.|The minute we got it, l think.
{6856}{6918}Everything's under control.|lt's gonna be okay.

{7079}{7162}A friend of mine collects them.|l don't know, some people save string.
{7164}{7248}You are a genius, Angela.|l can't thank you enough.
{7250}{7315}You might think differently|once you get my bill from Cathedral.
{7317}{7409}Whatever it is, it's worth it.|l'd love to show you my appreciation.
{7411}{7467}Take you out to dinner tonight,|some drinks.

{18078}{18135}- What took you so long?|- I was having way too much fun...
{18137}{18195}with this Mozart's Ghost.
{18220}{18302}By the way, l sent you a whopper|of a virus for your hall of fame.
{18304}{18364}Just be a little careful|with the escape button.
{18366}{18473}Look, here's the problem.|Pop yourself into concert information.
{18475}{18507}All right.
{18549}{18648}Houston Utilities. Dale, l think|you took a wrong turn here.
{18650}{18735}Not quite Ticketmaster, is it?|See anything unusual?
{18768}{18843}No, looks like a normal web page to me,|except for that...
{18845}{18898}little icon at the bottom|of the screen.
{18899}{18958}Click on it, and then|press control-shift.
{19135}{19208}- My God.|- So, what do you make of all this?
{19210}{19263}Simple.|lt's a programming glitch.
{19265}{19338}lt's a futzed keystroke that sent you|the wrong lnternet address.
{19340}{19438}Last night it sent me to Amtrak's|central mainframe and the Mayo Clinic.
{19439}{19487}Neither of them|are on the same subnet.
{19489}{19559}Angela, l've accessed|a system l shouldn't have.
{19560}{19639}lf someone gets ahold of that disk,|they'd have an awful lot of power.
{19641}{19706}Why don't you just crawl in there,|find the program error and delete it?
{19708}{19767}Not quite ready to do that yet.
{19769}{19846}Look, what's your day like tomorrow?
{19847}{19898}Oh, no. No.

{21690}{21759}Three-nine Mike Bravo,|that's a negative.
{21761}{21819}Verify your position|and check your instruments.
{21820}{21893}All normal, for crying out Ioud.|You must be able to see my lights.
{21895}{21988}That's a negative.|Execute a missed approach immediately.
{21990}{22048}Contact approach control on 124.5.

{24185}{24261}Replace Dale. Okay.|What? You're kidding, right?
{24262}{24326}Oh, God, l'm sorry.|l thought you'd heard.
{24349}{24395}What? What happened?
{24416}{24514}Angela, Dale's dead. His plane|crashed last night outside L.A.
{24516}{24623}l just talked to him yesterday.|He was coming to see me.
{24625}{24686}Kind of puts things|in perspective, doesn't it?

{31096}{31139}When l was about 13...
{31163}{31275}l had this sort of|identity crisis.
{31305}{31370}l used to think|l was one of the characters.
{31372}{31423}You thought|you were Audrey Hepburn?
{31443}{31535}- No, l used to think l was the cat.|- The cat?
{31537}{31589}l'd sit there...
{31590}{31676}and l'd play out|the last scene of the movie.
{31678}{31758}l'd just play it|over and over again.
{31819}{31874}- You know the last scene?|- Yes, I know the last scene.

{36245}{36306}- That's way over my head, l'm afraid.|- No, no.
{36307}{36420}You just go into people's systems,|you find the faults and you fix it.

{55385}{55469}appeared to tumble at a rate|reminiscent of the Black Tuesday crash.
{55471}{55531}Officials suspended trading|when it became clear...

{55624}{55714}- l need my room key for 2806, please.|- What is the name?

{56012}{56102}Pranks? Short-sheeting|someone's bed is a prank.
{56103}{56184}These Praetorians could've done|serious damage to our economy...

{58808}{58841}That's correct.
{58843}{58954}So all l would have to do|is just sign Ruth Marx and--

{62996}{63050}- ls this your signature?|- Well, no.
{63051}{63149}lt's my handwriting, but l just signed|a different name that they gave me.

{63275}{63357}- Yo, Mike. You wanna run this?|- l'll be right back.
{63359}{63410}lt's not gonna make any difference,|because what they've done is...

{63479}{63554}- Who's they?|- I have no idea.
{63556}{63634}Where do you work?|Do you work around here?

{72630}{72683}l just figured you would be safe.
{72685}{72781}Oh, great. So l've gone from being|a self-centered asshole to safe.
{72782}{72846}Thank you very much.
{72848}{72949}No, l just figured that they couldn't|trace me to you and that your--

{73026}{73113}My patient records.|Yeah, l knew l had my subtle charms.
{73115}{73189}lt's just you're the only person|l have to turn to right now.
{73191}{73312}And you know what, Angie?|l'm gonna take that as a big compliment.
{73314}{73387}Guess what time it is.|Gibsons.
{73389}{73457}Almost. We have no onions,|so we'll have to use these.
{73459}{73543}Seldane, the antihistamine|of champions.
{73568}{73618}l could always make you laugh,|couIdn't l?
{73619}{73666}You know what?|l'm gonna pass.
{73667}{73702}- No drink?|- No drink.
{73747}{73794}All right.|l come bearing gifts.

{74137}{74185}Hey, come here.
{74186}{74261}Come on. Look at me.|You're freaking me.
{74262}{74315}You gotta take a breath,|take a pause.
{74341}{74435}Okay, if you're not you,|tell me who you think you are.
{74437}{74492}- Christ, you're not even listening.|- l am listening.
{74494}{74548}But come on.|Somebody stole your purse.
{74550}{74622}- l didn't expect you to believe me.|- l do believe you.
{74624}{74688}That's not true.|You know what l believe?
{74690}{74747}l believe you're|a very frightened woman.
{74749}{74795}ln general, you're disconnected|from the human race.
{74797}{74853}l think you're way out there|on your own.
{74854}{74911}- You mix in your father leaving--|- Oh, no.
{74913}{75000}My father has nothing to do|with the fact that my car's missing.
{75002}{75067}lt has nothing to do with the fact|that my house is empty.
{75069}{75126}lt has nothing to do with the fact|that the police department...
{75127}{75187}is chasing after me and that|somebody out there wants to kiIl me.
{75188}{75266}l believe something happened,|but that just doesn't make sense.
{75268}{75334}l don't want to be simplistic...
{75336}{75410}but l think you're reaching out.
{75412}{75472}You know what?|You're absolutely right.
{75474}{75524}l'm reaching out|to anybody who knows me...
{75526}{75583}anybody who will listen to me|and believe me...
{75585}{75643}be my friend|and somebody to trust.
{75645}{75698}Hey, Angie, l'm sorry.
{75700}{75800}Sometimes it's easier for me|to play doctor than it is to listen.
{75802}{75904}l just don't understand. Why me?|l am nobody. l am nothing.
{75906}{75957}But they knew everything about me.
{75959}{76037}They knew what l ate, what l drank,|what movies l watched.
{76038}{76130}They knew where l was from. They knew|what cigarettes l used to smoke.
{76132}{76217}And everything they did,|they must have watched on the lnternet.
{76218}{76270}l don't know.|Watched my credit cards?
{76271}{76346}Our whole lives are on the computer,|and they knew that l could be vanished.
{76348}{76426}They knew that nobody would care|and it wouldn't matter.
{76428}{76516}lt's going to be okay.|What can I do?
{76518}{76585}l need for you to take my mom|and just put her anywhere.
{76586}{76634}l don't care where.|Just put her under a different name.
{76636}{76725}l don't know what these people will do.|You can do that 'cause you're a doctor?
{76726}{76801}I can put your mom|in a sanitarium for observation.
{76802}{76849}How's that?
{76850}{76950}That would mean a lot to me,|'cause she's all l got left right now.
{76952}{76998}All that you have left?
{77000}{77090}Christ, Angie, they've really|gotten into your head with this.
