2
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,845
Good morning, Bastian.

3
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,903
I had another dream, Dad, about Mom.

4
00:02:57,973 --> 00:02:59,634
I understand, son.

5
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:03,889
But we have to get on with things, right?

6
00:03:16,182 --> 00:03:18,844
Bastian, we each have responsibilities.

7
00:03:20,662 --> 00:03:22,459
We can't let Mom's death...

8
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:26,350
...be an excuse
for not getting the job done, right?

9
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,339
Yes.

10
00:03:43,704 --> 00:03:46,195
Son, it's time you and I had a talk.

11
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:53,164
I got a call from your math teacher
yesterday.

12
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:58,521
She says that you were...

13
00:03:58,775 --> 00:04:01,005
...drawing horses in your math book.

14
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,699
Unicorns. They were unicorns.

15
00:04:04,216 --> 00:04:05,114
What?

16
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:08,215
Nothing.

17
00:04:08,344 --> 00:04:11,677
She also says you don't
do your homework on time.

18
00:04:15,576 --> 00:04:18,807
I'm very disappointed you didn't even
try out for the swimming team.

19
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:23,642
As to those riding lessons you wanted...

20
00:04:24,537 --> 00:04:28,701
You say you love horses
but you're afraid to get on a real one.

21
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:34,514
You're old enough to get your head down
out of the clouds and...

22
00:04:35,258 --> 00:04:37,590
...and keep both feet on the ground.

23
00:04:40,537 --> 00:04:41,697
Okay.

24
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,554
Stop daydreaming.
Start facing your problems. Okay?

25
00:04:57,946 --> 00:05:02,007
There, I think we've had a nice talk.

26
00:05:02,617 --> 00:05:04,676
We should have more.

27
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,658
Have a good day, son.
Don't be late for school again.

28
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:10,359
But, yesterday I wasn't.

29
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:17,879
Hey, it's the weirdo.

30
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:21,900
Weirdo, you got any cash for us today?

31
00:05:26,907 --> 00:05:28,704
Let's get him!

32
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:39,288
You can't get away.

33
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,379
You're dead, chicken!

34
00:05:41,404 --> 00:05:42,632
We'll get you!

35
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:47,949
- Where's your money?
- I don't have any!

36
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:50,333
No money? Mamma's boy is holding out.

37
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:54,056
If you ain't got money,
you go in the garbage.

38
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:05,168
Maybe the chicken can lay an egg in there.

39
00:06:11,741 --> 00:06:14,539
Who said you could get out of the garbage?

40
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:16,257
Get back in there.

41
00:06:16,253 --> 00:06:17,618
Not again.

42
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,553
Not again!

43
00:06:19,582 --> 00:06:21,413
Where are you going, wimp?

44
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,353
- He went that way.
- Which way?

45
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:40,175
Get out of here! I don't like kids.

46
00:06:54,943 --> 00:06:57,844
Are you still here? Didn't you hear me?

47
00:06:58,271 --> 00:06:59,738
You're hiding, aren't you?

48
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,728
The video arcade is down the street.

49
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:07,758
Here we just sell small rectangular objects.
They're called books.

50
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:11,159
They require effort and make no beeps.

51
00:07:11,104 --> 00:07:12,093
On your way.

52
00:07:12,128 --> 00:07:15,996
I know books. I have 186 of them at home.

53
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,376
Comic books.

54
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:19,239
<i>No, I've read Treasure Island...</i>

55
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:21,626
<i>...The Last of the Mohicans, Wizard of Oz...</i>

56
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,569
<i>...Lord of the Rings,
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Tarzan.</i>

57
00:07:28,993 --> 00:07:30,984
Who are you running away from?

58
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:37,086
Some kids from school.

59
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:38,753
Why?

60
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,866
They threw me in the garbage.

61
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:44,008
Why not punch them in the nose?

62
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:48,595
I don't know.

63
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:56,297
What's that book about?

64
00:07:57,697 --> 00:08:00,860
Oh, this is something special.

65
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:08,778
Well, what is it?

66
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:12,324
Look.

67
00:08:13,507 --> 00:08:16,169
Your books are safe.

68
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:19,177
While you're reading them...

69
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:24,204
...you get to become
Tarzan or Robinson Crusoe.

70
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:26,228
But that's what I like about them.

71
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:30,141
But afterwards you get to be
a little boy again.

72
00:08:30,307 --> 00:08:32,298
What do you mean?

73
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:33,868
Listen.

74
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:37,912
Have you ever been...

75
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,281
...Captain Nemo...

76
00:08:41,027 --> 00:08:45,987
...trapped inside your submarine
while the giant squid is attacking you?

77
00:08:48,325 --> 00:08:49,155
Yes.

78
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:51,838
Weren't you afraid you couldn't escape?

79
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:53,980
But it's only a story.

80
00:08:54,148 --> 00:08:56,639
That's what I'm talking about.

81
00:08:57,189 --> 00:08:59,020
The ones you read...

82
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:00,428
...are safe.

83
00:09:03,588 --> 00:09:05,078
And that one isn't?

84
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:08,953
Don't worry about it.

85
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,521
But you just said it was...

86
00:09:19,046 --> 00:09:20,707
Forget about it.

87
00:09:21,318 --> 00:09:24,515
This book is not for you.

88
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:35,191
Koreander's.

89
00:09:37,158 --> 00:09:39,149
What can I do for you?

90
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:48,994
They run maybe 300, 370...

91
00:09:49,543 --> 00:09:51,408
It will take me a couple of a weeks.

92
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:45,306
Math test. Oh, no!

93
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:49,574
<i>"It was midnight in the Howling Forest.</i>

94
00:11:49,772 --> 00:11:53,936
<i>"The wind whistled
through the tops of the ancient trees.</i>

95
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:56,424
<i>"Suddenly, something enormous...</i>

96
00:11:56,524 --> 00:12:00,358
<i>"...crashed and rumbled
through the eerie woods. "</i>

97
00:12:25,038 --> 00:12:26,198
What's that?

98
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:02,407
Excuse me...

99
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:06,760
...but would it be all right
if I joined you this evening?

100
00:13:08,814 --> 00:13:13,148
You see, I've been traveling all day.

101
00:13:37,297 --> 00:13:41,233
Now I see why you picked this camp.

102
00:13:52,177 --> 00:13:55,669
A delicious looking limestone rock!

103
00:13:59,057 --> 00:14:00,957
Nice bouquet.

104
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:05,187
Must be a real vintage year.

105
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:08,984
Yes, you're right.

106
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,390
Those delicious rocks
are the reason we've camped here.

107
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:17,628
- Is he a nutcase?
- No, he's a Rock Biter.

108
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:18,909
A Rock Biter!

109
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:36,367
- Sorry.
- Poor baby.

110
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:42,087
Pardon me.

111
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,608
That was limestone, with a dash of quartz.

112
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,834
Very tasty.

113
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,763
Where I come from in the North,
we us to have exquisite gourmet rocks.

114
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:00,458
Only now...

115
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:02,662
...now...

116
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,793
...they're all gone.

117
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:08,612
I know how it happened.

118
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:11,663
I swear it wasn't me.

119
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:16,053
I think I know what it was. Tell us more.

120
00:15:16,021 --> 00:15:20,321
Near my home,
there used to be a beautiful lake...

121
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:22,280
...but then...

122
00:15:22,772 --> 00:15:25,605
...then it was gone.

123
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:27,773
Did the lake dry up?

124
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:31,073
No. It just wasn't there anymore.

125
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:35,885
Nothing was there anymore.
Not even a dried-up lake.

126
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:37,431
A hole?

127
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,624
A hole would be something.
No, it was Nothing.

128
00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:45,783
And it got bigger and bigger.

129
00:15:46,742 --> 00:15:49,438
First, there was no lake anymore.

130
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:53,128
And then, finally, no rocks.

131
00:15:58,901 --> 00:16:03,497
If he keeps stuffing his face like that,
soon there won't be any rocks here either.

132
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:06,779
Night Hob, this could be serious!

133
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,578
Rock Biter...

134
00:16:08,598 --> 00:16:11,761
...what you told us is also happening
where I live in the West.

135
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:14,796
A strange sort of Nothing
is destroying everything.

136
00:16:14,744 --> 00:16:19,181
Yes. We Night Hobs live in the South
and it's there, too.

137
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:25,186
So, it's not just in our part of Fantasia?

138
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,902
Maybe, it's already everywhere.

139
00:16:36,374 --> 00:16:39,172
Maybe our whole land is in danger.

140
00:16:40,056 --> 00:16:41,387
What can we do?

141
00:16:41,624 --> 00:16:46,357
My people are sending me to
the Ivory Tower, to the Empress, for help.

142
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:47,989
We are on the same...

143
00:16:48,663 --> 00:16:53,327
We are on the same mission.
After all, if the Empress can't save us...

144
00:16:53,464 --> 00:16:54,692
...who could?

145
00:16:54,744 --> 00:16:57,235
Then why are we all just sitting here...

146
00:16:57,593 --> 00:17:00,391
...instead of taking off for the Ivory Tower?

147
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:02,549
What are we waiting for?

148
00:17:02,552 --> 00:17:04,850
Yes. Let's go now.

149
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,291
Wake up!

150
00:17:06,457 --> 00:17:07,856
Come on, old girl.

151
00:17:07,864 --> 00:17:09,855
We can't just hang around here.

152
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:12,647
Wake up! Ready for takeoff.

153
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:14,759
Oh, stupid bat!

154
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:19,185
We can't wait for a snail. Can I carry you?

155
00:17:19,097 --> 00:17:22,464
Don't worry. It's a racing snail.

156
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:27,196
But we can't even wait for a racing snail.

157
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:32,533
It really is a racing snail.

158
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,893
Nobody gives a hoot
about me and my stupid bat.

159
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:51,459
Maybe I'll take a few of these
yummy gourmet rocks, for the road...

160
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,328
The Nothing!

161
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:33,113
Look!

162
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,121
There it is!

163
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:39,458
The heart of Fantasia!

164
00:18:59,198 --> 00:19:03,157
I never knew it was that beautiful.

165
00:19:16,543 --> 00:19:17,669
Stay awake!

166
00:19:19,806 --> 00:19:21,797
I told you to stay awake.

167
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,532
The home of the Empress.

168
00:20:10,464 --> 00:20:12,056
She's our only hope.

169
00:20:44,418 --> 00:20:47,649
Friends, I know why you are all here.

170
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:50,196
The Nothing...

171
00:20:52,771 --> 00:20:54,932
...is destroying our world.

172
00:20:57,186 --> 00:20:59,518
I also know that you...

173
00:20:59,907 --> 00:21:02,239
...have come to beseech...

174
00:21:03,266 --> 00:21:05,097
...the Empress for help.

175
00:21:09,219 --> 00:21:11,210
But I have terrible news.

176
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:16,502
The Empress herself
has become deathly ill.

177
00:21:19,555 --> 00:21:24,424
There seems to be a mysterious link
between her illness and the Nothing.

178
00:21:26,724 --> 00:21:28,385
She's dying.

179
00:21:32,804 --> 00:21:36,535
So, she cannot save us.

180
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:41,589
But there just might be one chance.

181
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:48,992
The Plains People
who hunt the purple buffalo...

182
00:21:49,188 --> 00:21:51,349
...have among them a great warrior.

183
00:21:51,588 --> 00:21:55,752
He alone has a chance
to fight the Nothing and save us.

184
00:21:57,222 --> 00:21:59,213
He is our only hope.

185
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:04,729
His name is Atreyu.

186
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,931
Atreyu.

187
00:22:34,503 --> 00:22:37,904
<i>"The Empress had already
sent for the great warrior.</i>

188
00:22:38,631 --> 00:22:42,397
<i>"When he finally appeared
on the terrace of the Ivory Tower...</i>

189
00:22:42,951 --> 00:22:46,944
<i>"...he carried with him
the hopes of all Fantasia. "</i>

190
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:05,336
A little boy!

191
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:10,018
I'm sorry, but this is not
the time nor place for children.

192
00:23:11,177 --> 00:23:12,439
You must leave.

193
00:23:12,712 --> 00:23:15,704
If you don't want me here,
you shouldn't have sent for me.

194
00:23:18,888 --> 00:23:19,786
Is he a nutcase?

195
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,512
It was not you we sent for.
We wanted Atreyu.

196
00:23:23,048 --> 00:23:24,538
I am Atreyu.

197
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:28,463
Not Atreyu the Child.

198
00:23:28,713 --> 00:23:30,340
Atreyu the Warrior.

199
00:23:30,346 --> 00:23:33,008
I am the only Atreyu of the Plains People.

200
00:23:33,225 --> 00:23:36,160
But I'll be happy to go back
to hunting the purple buffalo.

201
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:38,827
Wait!

202
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:44,453
Come back, please.

203
00:23:55,113 --> 00:23:58,276
If you really are the Atreyu we sent for...

204
00:23:58,474 --> 00:24:01,136
...you would be willing to go on a quest?

205
00:24:03,114 --> 00:24:04,945
Yes, of course.

206
00:24:05,963 --> 00:24:07,624
What kind of a quest?

207
00:24:07,818 --> 00:24:10,309
To find a cure for the Empress...

208
00:24:12,395 --> 00:24:14,386
...and to save our world.

209
00:24:15,594 --> 00:24:18,825
No one can give you any advice
except this:

210
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:22,280
You must go alone.

211
00:24:23,404 --> 00:24:25,895
You must leave all your weapons behind.

212
00:24:28,459 --> 00:24:30,393
It will be very dangerous.

213
00:24:32,075 --> 00:24:33,702
Any chance of success?

214
00:24:35,659 --> 00:24:36,921
I do not know.

215
00:24:37,483 --> 00:24:39,144
But if you fail...

216
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:42,087
...the Empress will surely die...

217
00:24:42,412 --> 00:24:45,279
...and our whole world will be destroyed.

218
00:25:05,357 --> 00:25:06,449
When do I begin?

219
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:11,550
Now. And you must hurry, Atreyu.

220
00:25:11,629 --> 00:25:13,961
The Nothing grows stronger every day.

221
00:25:20,205 --> 00:25:21,399
Take this.

222
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,521
The Auryn!

223
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:41,819
He who wears the Auryn
speaks for the Empress.

224
00:25:42,223 --> 00:25:45,215
It will guide and protect you.

225
00:25:57,615 --> 00:25:58,741
Wake up.

226
00:25:58,862 --> 00:26:00,454
Farewell, Atreyu.

227
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,340
Take care.

228

What is it, Artax?

Is it time to go already?

238
00:27:44,114 --> 00:27:47,447
I know what you want. It's time to eat.

239
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,632
Good idea.

240

No, it's a great idea!

241

No, not too much.

242

Morla.

But that's impossible.
They couldn't have heard me.

281
00:35:32,615 --> 00:35:35,243
Are you Morla, the Ancient One?

282
00:35:40,615 --> 00:35:45,643
Not that it matters, but yes.

283
00:35:45,736 --> 00:35:49,035
Please help me. Do you recognize this?

284
00:35:49,736 --> 00:35:51,067
Well...

285
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:54,243
...we haven't seen...

00:35:54,248 --> 00:35:58,241
...the Auryn in a long time.

287
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,750
We?

288
00:36:02,056 --> 00:36:03,819
Is there someone else here, too?

289
00:36:03,816 --> 00:36:08,583
We haven't spoken to anyone else...

290

...for thousands of years.

291
00:36:12,456 --> 00:36:16,153
So we started talking...

292
00:36:16,072 --> 00:36:18,063
...to ourselves.

293
00:36:29,961 --> 00:36:32,191
Morla, I bring terrible news.

294
00:36:32,553 --> 00:36:34,487
Did you know the Empress is ill?

295
00:36:34,473 --> 00:36:38,409
Not that it matters, but yes.

296
00:36:38,858 --> 00:36:41,850
Actually, we don't care.

297
00:36:41,898 --> 00:36:43,798
If I don't save her, she'll die.

298
00:36:43,882 --> 00:36:46,510
There's a terrible Nothing
sweeping over the land.

299
00:36:46,474 --> 00:36:47,805
Don't you care?

300
00:36:47,978 --> 00:36:50,310
We don't even care...

301
00:36:51,115 --> 00:36:54,175
...whether or not we care.

302
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,174
Do you have a cold?

303
00:37:02,188 --> 00:37:06,522
No. We're allergic...

304
00:37:07,211 --> 00:37:08,769
...to youth.

305
00:37:12,907 --> 00:37:15,068
You know how to help the Empress,
don't you?

306
00:37:15,051 --> 00:37:17,576
Not that it matters...

307
00:37:18,283 --> 00:37:20,444
...but yes.

308
00:37:20,428 --> 00:37:24,626
If you don't tell me and the Nothing
keeps coming, you'll die too. Both of you.

309
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:26,760
Die?

310
00:37:27,405 --> 00:37:31,068
That, at least, would be something.

311
00:37:41,964 --> 00:37:44,558
Please help me.
You said you knew the answer.

312
00:37:45,484 --> 00:37:48,510
We're tired of sneezing.

313
00:37:48,461 --> 00:37:52,227
Go away! Nothing matters.

314
00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:56,491
That's not true.
If it didn't matter to you, you could tell me.

315
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:01,279
Clever boy.

316
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:02,754
Tell me, please.

317
00:38:03,342 --> 00:38:05,333
We don't know.

318
00:38:06,381 --> 00:38:08,941
But you can ask...

319
00:38:09,101 --> 00:38:11,365
...the Southern Oracle.

320
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:12,772
How can I get there?

321
00:38:12,781 --> 00:38:14,442
You can't.

322
00:38:15,566 --> 00:38:20,560
It's 10,000 miles away.

323

But that's so far.

324
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:27,372
That's right.

325
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:30,373
Forget it.

326
00:38:31,982 --> 00:38:33,574
Give up.

327
00:40:00,786 --> 00:40:01,946
No.

328
00:40:03,763 --> 00:40:05,924
Atreyu wouldn't quit now.

00:41:52,855 --> 00:41:55,790
<i>"...Atreyu slowly opened his eyes...</i>

332
00:41:56,407 --> 00:42:00,309
<i>"...and found himself
in strange surroundings.</i>

333
00:42:00,887 --> 00:42:03,879
<i>"He was clean and
his wounds were dressed. "</i>

334
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:02,346
Leaving so soon?

335
00:43:10,042 --> 00:43:12,010
I was just going to...

336
00:43:12,346 --> 00:43:14,041
I have to...

337
00:43:14,363 --> 00:43:16,388
- I was trying to...
- Sneak away?

338
00:43:16,379 --> 00:43:18,847
Yes. I mean, no.

339
00:43:18,938 --> 00:43:20,599
I like children.

340
00:43:21,339 --> 00:43:22,601
For breakfast?

341
00:43:24,123 --> 00:43:27,524
Never. I'm a luck dragon.

342
00:43:27,995 --> 00:43:29,986
My name is Falkor.

343
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:34,901
- And my name is...
- Atreyu. And you're on a quest.

344
00:43:34,906 --> 00:43:36,237
How did you know that?

345
00:43:36,251 --> 00:43:37,912
You were unconscious.

346
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:40,446
You talked in your sleep.

347
00:43:43,228 --> 00:43:45,628
Could you get around...

348
00:43:46,396 --> 00:43:49,763
...and scratch behind my right ear?

349
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:53,590
I can never quite reach it.

350
00:43:59,323 --> 00:44:00,221
Here?

351
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,112
That's so good.

352
00:44:14,141 --> 00:44:15,267
Thank you.

353
00:44:17,852 --> 00:44:22,721
So, little fellow, you're on your way
to the Southern Oracle?

354
00:44:22,846 --> 00:44:25,246
Yes. But it's hopeless.

355
00:44:25,757 --> 00:44:29,784
- It's too far away.
- I wouldn't necessarily say that.

356
00:44:30,973 --> 00:44:32,440
You know how to get there?

357
00:44:32,446 --> 00:44:35,973
Sure. It's right around the corner.

358
00:44:35,901 --> 00:44:37,732
How did all this happen?

359
00:44:38,815 --> 00:44:40,476
With luck.

360
00:44:41,373 --> 00:44:44,274
You brought me the entire 10,000 miles?

361
00:44:44,414 --> 00:44:50,046
No. Only 9,891...

362
00:44:50,142 --> 00:44:52,076
...as the dragon flies.

363
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,001
You're amazing.

364
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:59,708
Having a luck dragon with you
is the only way to go on a quest.

365
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:01,999
Things will work out fine.

366
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:07,225
Never give up and good luck will find you.

367
00:45:09,632 --> 00:45:11,725
It's good to have a friend again.

368
00:45:15,071 --> 00:45:17,232
You have more than one.

369
00:45:18,911 --> 00:45:20,242
Look.

370
00:46:14,721 --> 00:46:16,814
Get out of my light, wench.

371
00:46:16,834 --> 00:46:19,268
You're disturbing my scientific work.

372
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:21,896
You and your scientific work.

373
00:46:22,275 --> 00:46:25,938
What the boy needs now
is one of my potions.

374
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:30,234
The boy will need
my scientific advice much more.

375
00:46:31,554 --> 00:46:33,215
But not until he's well.

376
00:46:33,315 --> 00:46:36,614
Get back to your own corner, Engy.

377
00:46:36,706 --> 00:46:39,266
I'm always finding you in my place.

378
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:43,562
He's well.

379
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,207
Now it's my turn with him.

380
00:46:46,211 --> 00:46:47,974
No, you don't!

381
00:46:48,674 --> 00:46:52,337
I'll decide when he's well.
It's your turn when I say it is.

382
00:46:54,276 --> 00:46:56,608
Well, little man, still in pain?

383
00:46:56,963 --> 00:46:58,055
It's all right.

384
00:46:58,083 --> 00:47:02,417
I like that.
The patient telling the doctor it's all right.

385
00:47:02,692 --> 00:47:05,525
It has to hurt if it's to heal.

386
00:47:08,644 --> 00:47:09,770
Drink that.

387
00:47:11,812 --> 00:47:12,744
Good?

388
00:47:13,796 --> 00:47:15,627
That's my bat-wing broth.

389
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,777
There's eye of newt in there,
tree mold, old lizard brains...

390
00:47:19,716 --> 00:47:23,049
...scales from a rancid sea serpent.

391
00:47:23,237 --> 00:47:27,071
Just where did you
and your dragon come from?

392
00:47:27,236 --> 00:47:28,703
What are you on to?

393
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:32,032
Anything of interest
to the scientific community?

394
00:47:31,973 --> 00:47:34,965
My name is Atreyu.
I came to find the Southern Oracle.

395
00:47:35,365 --> 00:47:36,696
Here we go again.

396
00:47:36,837 --> 00:47:39,601
You've come to the right place, my boy.

397
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:42,902
I am somewhat of an expert
on the Southern Oracle.

398
00:47:42,917 --> 00:47:45,886
"It is my scientific specialty."

399
00:47:46,086 --> 00:47:48,213
It is my scientific specialty.

400
00:47:48,677 --> 00:47:53,410
Why don't you sit down
and be quiet for once?

401
00:47:53,318 --> 00:47:55,252
You keep quiet, wench.

402
00:47:55,558 --> 00:47:56,786
It's my turn.

403
00:47:59,749 --> 00:48:03,981
My name is Engywook.
She's Urgl. Ever heard of me?

404
00:48:04,135 --> 00:48:05,500
I don't think so.

405
00:48:06,054 --> 00:48:08,545
You don't move in scientific circles.

406
00:48:08,902 --> 00:48:11,666
I am the expert on the Southern Oracle.

407
00:48:12,262 --> 00:48:14,457
You've come to the right place.

408
00:48:14,439 --> 00:48:16,600
There's no fool like an old fool.

409
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,012
Wait! Stay here.

410
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:22,978
The observatory. To the winch, wench.

411
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:31,473
Come on, lazybones!
Can't you go any faster?

412
00:48:34,087 --> 00:48:37,420
I've been studying
the Southern Oracle for years.

413
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,471
Some day I'll publish my book:

414
00:48:39,591 --> 00:48:43,254
<i>A Century of Studying the Southern Oracle,
by Professor Engywook.</i>

415
00:48:43,464 --> 00:48:45,455
<i>Volume I: The Early Years.</i>

416
00:48:47,401 --> 00:48:49,596
Have you ever been
to the Southern Oracle?

417
00:48:50,151 --> 00:48:51,550
What do you think?

418
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,721
I work scientifically.

419
00:49:15,658 --> 00:49:16,647
Look.

420
00:49:24,969 --> 00:49:26,800
Is that the Southern Oracle?

421
00:49:27,274 --> 00:49:30,869
No. It's the first of the two gates
you must pass through...

422
00:49:30,986 --> 00:49:33,477
...before you reach the Southern Oracle...

423
00:49:33,482 --> 00:49:36,576
...and get me the final information
for my book.

424
00:49:38,122 --> 00:49:40,955
Of course, most people...

425
00:49:41,803 --> 00:49:43,794
...never get that far.

426
00:49:45,163 --> 00:49:46,152
Why?

427
00:49:46,635 --> 00:49:47,966
The Sphinxes' eyes...

428
00:49:47,979 --> 00:49:52,575
...stay closed until someone
who does not feel his own worth...

429
00:49:52,779 --> 00:49:54,269
...tries to pass by.

430
00:50:02,923 --> 00:50:05,915
Here comes one that looks fancy.

431
00:50:11,181 --> 00:50:14,514
Let's see what he really thinks of himself.

432
00:50:21,581 --> 00:50:23,845
Go on, scaredy-cat!

433
00:50:27,212 --> 00:50:30,978
It's my turn. Let me see. I'm the scientist.

434
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:32,581
He's going on.

435
00:50:33,805 --> 00:50:35,397
I think he'll make it.

436
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:40,460
The Sphinxes' eyes, are they open or shut?
Let me see.

437
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:42,368
They're shut.

438
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,550
The eyes are opening!

439
00:51:02,446 --> 00:51:04,880
Did he make it? Did he?

440
00:51:11,247 --> 00:51:13,579
Fancy armor doesn't help.

441
00:51:14,158 --> 00:51:18,458
The Sphinxes can see
straight into your heart.

442
00:51:22,223 --> 00:51:23,212
Listen.

443
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:26,742
Next time let me see what happens.
It's my telescope.

444
00:51:31,215 --> 00:51:32,477
I'm going to try.

445
00:51:33,487 --> 00:51:36,786
Don't go yet.
I haven't told you about the next gate.

446
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,845
It's even worse than this one.

447
00:52:17,138 --> 00:52:20,505
He'll never make it.

448
00:53:49,621 --> 00:53:53,352
Don't start to doubt yourself. Be confident.

449
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,817
Be confident.

450
00:54:07,925 --> 00:54:09,119
Run, Atreyu!

451
00:54:09,974 --> 00:54:11,305
Run, Atreyu!

452
00:54:15,222 --> 00:54:16,189
Run! Now!

453
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,272
He made it.

454
00:54:31,447 --> 00:54:32,778
He made it.

455
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:42,727
He made it!

456
00:54:46,775 --> 00:54:49,676
You could use a dose of juicy vitamins, too.

457
00:54:49,623 --> 00:54:54,458
He made it!
Atreyu made it through the Sphinx gate.

458
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:57,601
- I always said he could do it.
- Good.

459
00:54:59,352 --> 00:55:02,913
But that's no reason
to fall out of the basket again.

460
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:05,440
I knew he'd be safe.

461
00:55:05,816 --> 00:55:09,343
Nonsense. You don't understand anything.

462
00:55:10,232 --> 00:55:15,067
The worst one is coming up.
Next is the Magic Mirror Gate.

463
00:55:15,672 --> 00:55:18,664
Atreyu must face his true self.

464
00:55:18,616 --> 00:55:22,712
So what? That won't be too hard for him.

465
00:55:22,617 --> 00:55:25,108
That's what everyone thinks.

466
00:55:25,496 --> 00:55:28,659
But kind people find that they are cruel.

467
00:55:29,113 --> 00:55:32,879
Brave men discover
they are really cowards.

468
00:55:33,273 --> 00:55:35,741
Confronted with their true selves...

469
00:55:35,705 --> 00:55:39,197
...most men run away screaming.

470
00:57:30,942 --> 00:57:33,274
Now, this is going too far.

471
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:53,328
What if they...

472
00:57:53,535 --> 00:57:56,868
...really do know about me in Fantasia?

473
00:58:43,617 --> 00:58:45,608
The Southern Oracle?

474
00:59:04,258 --> 00:59:06,192
<i>Do not be afraid.</i>

475
00:59:06,914 --> 00:59:09,075
<i>We will not harm you.</i>

476
00:59:11,042 --> 00:59:15,536
<i>We have been waiting for you a long time.</i>

477
00:59:19,747 --> 00:59:21,578
Are you the Southern Oracle?

478
00:59:21,954 --> 00:59:24,582
<i>Yes, we are.</i>

479
00:59:24,931 --> 00:59:27,593
Then you must know
what can save Fantasia.

480
00:59:27,874 --> 00:59:30,434
<i>Yes, we do.</i>

481
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:34,611
Well, what is it? I have to know!

482
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,277
<i>The Empress...</i>

483
00:59:37,571 --> 00:59:39,004
<i>... needs...</i>

484
00:59:39,523 --> 00:59:41,354
<i>... a new name.</i>

485
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:46,769
A new name? That's all?

486
00:59:47,204 --> 00:59:48,364
But that's easy.

487
00:59:49,796 --> 00:59:52,060
I can give her any name she wants.

488
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:55,016
<i>No one from Fantasia...</i>

489
00:59:55,844 --> 00:59:57,505
<i>... can do it.</i>

490
00:59:57,827 --> 01:00:00,489
<i>Only a human child...</i>

491
01:00:01,668 --> 01:00:04,000
<i>... can give her this new name.</i>

492
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:12,213
A human child? Where can I find one?

493
01:00:12,582 --> 01:00:14,914
<i>You can only find one...</i>

494
01:00:16,261 --> 01:00:19,924
<i>... beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.</i>

495
01:00:25,574 --> 01:00:28,407
<i>If you want to save our world...</i>

496
01:00:29,093 --> 01:00:30,890
<i>... you must hurry.</i>

497
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:35,459
<i>We don't know...</i>

498
01:00:35,558 --> 01:00:39,392
<i>... how much longer
we can withstand the Nothing.</i>

499
01:00:42,918 --> 01:00:44,783
Falkor!

500
01:01:04,231 --> 01:01:06,893
Hurry, Falkor! The Nothing's everywhere.

501
01:01:06,888 --> 01:01:08,685
Don't worry.

502
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:12,578
We'll reach the boundaries of Fantasia.

503
01:01:12,552 --> 01:01:16,386
- Do you know where they are?
- I have no idea.

504
01:01:17,128 --> 01:01:19,460
Then how do we find a human child?

505
01:01:19,687 --> 01:01:21,348
With luck.

506
01:01:22,727 --> 01:01:25,719
Faster, Falkor! We have to hurry.

507
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,633
All right, hang on tight.

508
01:02:38,027 --> 01:02:40,689
What a shame they don't ask me.

509
01:02:41,547 --> 01:02:42,878
My mother...

510
01:02:43,563 --> 01:02:46,225
...she had such a wonderful name.

511
01:03:00,972 --> 01:03:05,636
"On and on they flew
until they reached the Sea of Possibilities...

512
01:03:05,868 --> 01:03:07,836
"...where they could go no further."

513
01:03:09,996 --> 01:03:12,328
Look, Atreyu. The Nothing.

514
01:04:10,094 --> 01:04:11,425
Atreyu.

515
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,781
Falkor!

516
01:04:44,785 --> 01:04:46,946
Where are you?

517
01:05:07,697 --> 01:05:10,894
Atreyu! Where are you?

518
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:03,271
They look like big...

519
01:06:03,412 --> 01:06:07,542
...good, strong hands, don't they?

520
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:12,973
I always thought that's what they were.

521
01:06:17,172 --> 01:06:19,640
My little friends.

522
01:06:19,956 --> 01:06:22,618
The little man with his racing snail...

523
01:06:22,803 --> 01:06:24,395
...the Night Hob...

524
01:06:25,013 --> 01:06:27,641
...even the stupid bat.

525
01:06:28,436 --> 01:06:31,269
I couldn't hold on to them.

526
01:06:32,404 --> 01:06:33,735
The Nothing...

527
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:38,233
...pulled them right out of my hands.

528
01:06:39,606 --> 01:06:41,267
I failed.

529
01:06:41,652 --> 01:06:44,644
No, you didn't fail. I'm the one who failed.

530
01:06:44,949 --> 01:06:47,782
I was the one chosen to stop the Nothing.

531
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:51,101
But I lost the Auryn.

532
01:06:51,509 --> 01:06:53,670
I can't find my luck dragon.

533
01:06:53,878 --> 01:06:57,370
So I won't be able to get beyond
the boundaries of Fantasia.

534
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:06,761
Listen.

535
01:07:07,254 --> 01:07:08,744
The Nothing...

536
01:07:09,142 --> 01:07:11,042
...will be here any minute.

537
01:07:11,574 --> 01:07:14,065
I will just sit here...

538
01:07:14,646 --> 01:07:17,137
...and let it take me away, too.

539
01:07:18,583 --> 01:07:20,244
They look...

540
01:07:21,015 --> 01:07:22,846
...like good...

541
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:25,021
...strong...

542
01:07:25,143 --> 01:07:28,340
...hands, don't they?

543
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:29,302
Morla?

544
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:34,060
Artax!

545
01:09:23,195 --> 01:09:25,186
If you come any closer...

546
01:09:26,269 --> 01:09:29,102
...I will rip you to shreds.

547
01:09:35,452 --> 01:09:36,919
Who are you?

548
01:09:36,957 --> 01:09:39,289
I am Gmork.

549
01:09:40,827 --> 01:09:43,990
And you, whoever you are...

550
01:09:44,509 --> 01:09:48,240
...can have the honor
of being my last victim.

551
01:09:51,709 --> 01:09:53,404
I will not die easily.

552
01:09:54,045 --> 01:09:55,706
I am a warrior.

553
01:09:57,022 --> 01:09:59,013
Brave warrior.

554
01:09:59,453 --> 01:10:01,284
Then fight the Nothing.

555
01:10:01,277 --> 01:10:05,179
I can't. I can't get beyond
the boundaries of Fantasia.

556
01:10:07,582 --> 01:10:09,049
What's so funny?

557
01:10:09,085 --> 01:10:12,919
Fantasia has no boundaries.

558
01:10:18,815 --> 01:10:20,180
That's not true.

559
01:10:20,414 --> 01:10:23,076
- You're lying.
- Foolish boy.

560
01:10:24,702 --> 01:10:27,796
Don't you know anything about Fantasia?

561
01:10:28,511 --> 01:10:31,503
It's the world of human fantasy.

562
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:35,452
Every part...

563
01:10:36,158 --> 01:10:37,750
...every creature...

564
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:42,733
...is a piece of the dreams
and hopes of mankind.

565
01:10:44,799 --> 01:10:46,460
Therefore...

566
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:50,168
...it has no boundaries.

567
01:10:57,536 --> 01:10:59,527
Why is Fantasia dying then?

568
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:03,514
Because people have begun
to lose their hopes...

569
01:11:04,575 --> 01:11:07,237
...and forget their dreams.

570
01:11:08,256 --> 01:11:11,089
So the Nothing grows stronger.

571
01:11:11,456 --> 01:11:12,946
What is the Nothing?

572
01:11:13,152 --> 01:11:15,814
It's the emptiness that's left.

573
01:11:17,056 --> 01:11:19,217
It is like a despair...

574
01:11:19,617 --> 01:11:21,778
...destroying this world.

575
01:11:22,433 --> 01:11:25,527
And I have been trying to help it.

576
01:11:27,265 --> 01:11:28,357
But why?

577
01:11:28,673 --> 01:11:31,665
Because people who have no hopes...

578
01:11:32,257 --> 01:11:34,521
...are easy to control.

579
01:11:35,776 --> 01:11:38,438
And whoever has the control...

580
01:11:39,714 --> 01:11:42,046
...has the power.

581
01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:58,030
Who are you, really?

582
01:11:58,499 --> 01:12:00,490
I am the servant...

583
01:12:01,923 --> 01:12:04,756
...of the power behind the Nothing.

584
01:12:05,826 --> 01:12:09,159
I was sent to kill the only one...

585
01:12:09,635 --> 01:12:11,967
...who could have stopped the Nothing.

586
01:12:12,483 --> 01:12:15,816
I lost him in the Swamps of Sadness.

587
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:17,622
His name...

588
01:12:18,819 --> 01:12:20,150
...was Atreyu.

589
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:28,614
If we're about to die anyway,
I'd rather die fighting.

590
01:12:29,155 --> 01:12:32,682
Come for me, Gmork. I am Atreyu!

591
01:14:01,095 --> 01:14:02,585
Falkor!

592
01:14:11,495 --> 01:14:13,156
Atreyu!

593
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:37,850
<i>"That was the end of Fantasia.</i>

594
01:14:38,441 --> 01:14:41,376
<i>"Only a few fragments of this once...</i>

595
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:45,678
<i>"...rich and beautiful world
had been left by the Nothing. "</i>

596
01:14:55,562 --> 01:14:57,393
Good old Falkor.

597
01:14:57,835 --> 01:15:02,204
- Can you see anything? Anything at all?
- No.

598
01:15:03,274 --> 01:15:05,765
All the land is gone.

599
01:15:06,794 --> 01:15:10,127
I know. And all because I failed.

600
01:15:11,146 --> 01:15:12,704
You tried.

601
01:15:13,066 --> 01:15:15,557
Could the Ivory Tower still be standing?

602
01:15:15,851 --> 01:15:20,083
Let's hope so, Atreyu. Let's hope so.

603
01:15:24,555 --> 01:15:26,546
Let the Auryn guide you.

604
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:32,133
If the Ivory Tower still stands,
take us there.

605
01:15:50,989 --> 01:15:52,650
The Ivory Tower!

606
01:16:53,263 --> 01:16:54,753
The Empress.

607
01:17:18,895 --> 01:17:20,226
Go on.

608
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,233
Why do you look so sad?

609
01:18:19,282 --> 01:18:21,079
I have failed you, Empress.

610
01:18:25,522 --> 01:18:26,682
You haven't.

611
01:18:28,306 --> 01:18:29,933
You brought him with you.

612
01:18:31,827 --> 01:18:32,816
Who?

613
01:18:33,394 --> 01:18:35,624
The earthling child.

614
01:18:36,243 --> 01:18:37,835
The one...

615
01:18:37,843 --> 01:18:40,004
...who can save us all.

616
01:18:40,627 --> 01:18:42,788
You knew about the earthling child?

617
01:18:43,731 --> 01:18:47,565
Of course. I knew everything.

618
01:18:48,914 --> 01:18:52,281
My horse died, I nearly drowned.

619
01:18:52,403 --> 01:18:54,803
I just barely got away from the Nothing.

620
01:18:54,835 --> 01:18:57,633
For what? To find out
what you already knew?

621
01:18:57,588 --> 01:19:00,921
It was the only way
to get in touch with an earthling.

622
01:19:01,043 --> 01:19:03,307
But I didn't get in touch with an earthling!

623
01:19:04,917 --> 01:19:06,578
Yes, you did.

624
01:19:07,732 --> 01:19:09,165
He has suffered with you.

625
01:19:10,292 --> 01:19:13,284
<i>He went through everything
you went through.</i>

626
01:19:14,356 --> 01:19:17,189
<i>And now, he has come here...</i>

627
01:19:18,069 --> 01:19:19,127
<i>... with you.</i>

628
01:19:20,212 --> 01:19:23,375
He is very close, listening...

629
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:28,470
...to every word we say.

630
01:19:28,822 --> 01:19:29,811
What?

631
01:19:44,309 --> 01:19:48,040
Where is he?
If he's so close, why doesn't he arrive?

632
01:19:53,014 --> 01:19:57,849
<i>He doesn't realize
he's already part of The Neverending Story.</i>

633
01:20:00,023 --> 01:20:01,820
<i>The Neverending Story?</i>

634
01:20:01,814 --> 01:20:03,406
What's that?

635
01:20:03,414 --> 01:20:06,872
Just as he is sharing all your adventures...

636
01:20:06,838 --> 01:20:09,329
...others are sharing his.

637
01:20:09,752 --> 01:20:11,014
They were with him...

638
01:20:11,319 --> 01:20:14,152
<i>... when he hid from the boys
in the bookstore.</i>

639
01:20:16,535 --> 01:20:18,230
But that's impossible!

640
01:20:18,392 --> 01:20:20,883
They were with him
when he took the book...

641
01:20:20,952 --> 01:20:23,011
...with the Auryn symbol on the cover...

642
01:20:24,023 --> 01:20:27,322
<i>... in which he's reading his own story...</i>

643
01:20:28,024 --> 01:20:29,514
...right now.

644
01:20:34,744 --> 01:20:36,735
I can't believe it.

645
01:20:38,072 --> 01:20:40,404
They can't be talking about me.

646
01:20:43,448 --> 01:20:45,473
What if he doesn't appear?

647
01:20:45,464 --> 01:20:47,864
Then our world will disappear.

648
01:20:48,728 --> 01:20:50,389
And so will I.

649
01:20:53,497 --> 01:20:55,294
How could he let that happen?

650
01:20:55,288 --> 01:21:00,089
He doesn't understand that he's the one
with the power to stop it.

651
01:20:59,962 --> 01:21:02,396
He simply can't imagine...

652
01:21:02,361 --> 01:21:05,228
...that one little boy
could be that important.

653
01:21:07,801 --> 01:21:09,268
Is it really me?

654
01:21:10,137 --> 01:21:11,764
Maybe he doesn't know what to do.

655
01:21:12,122 --> 01:21:13,589
What do I have to do?

656
01:21:14,265 --> 01:21:17,257
He has to give me a new name.

657
01:21:17,465 --> 01:21:19,626
He's already chosen it.

658
01:21:20,601 --> 01:21:22,592
He just has to call it out.

659
01:21:26,201 --> 01:21:28,726
But it's only a story. It's not real.

660
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:29,822
It's only a story.

661
01:21:31,226 --> 01:21:33,217
Atreyu, no!

662
01:21:56,826 --> 01:21:58,487
Bastian!

663
01:22:00,411 --> 01:22:04,074
Why don't you do
what you dream, Bastian?

664
01:22:04,251 --> 01:22:07,687
But I can't.
I must keep my feet on the ground.

665
01:22:07,835 --> 01:22:09,496
Call my name.

666
01:22:11,932 --> 01:22:14,924
Bastian, please!

667
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:18,062
Save us!

668
01:22:18,076 --> 01:22:20,169
<i>All right! I'll do it!</i>

669
01:22:20,348 --> 01:22:24,045
I'll save you. I will do what I dream.

670
01:22:48,061 --> 01:22:50,052
<i>Why is it so dark?</i>

671
01:22:50,813 --> 01:22:54,647
<i>In the beginning, it is always dark.</i>

672
01:22:59,294 --> 01:23:00,784
What is that?

673
01:23:01,277 --> 01:23:03,438
One grain of sand.

674
01:23:03,966 --> 01:23:07,629
It is all that remains of my vast empire.

675
01:23:15,006 --> 01:23:17,770
Fantasia has totally disappeared?

676
01:23:19,103 --> 01:23:20,593
Yes.

677
01:23:23,295 --> 01:23:25,786
Then everything's been in vain.

678
01:23:26,495 --> 01:23:28,656
No, it hasn't.

679
01:23:29,855 --> 01:23:32,483
Fantasia can arise anew...

680
01:23:33,887 --> 01:23:36,549
...from your dreams and wishes.

681
01:23:38,176 --> 01:23:39,336
How?

682
01:23:40,031 --> 01:23:41,862
Open your hand.

683
01:23:56,096 --> 01:23:58,257
What are you going to wish for?

684
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:01,617
I don't know.

685
01:24:03,328 --> 01:24:07,162
Then there will be no Fantasia anymore.

686
01:24:11,328 --> 01:24:13,057
How many wishes do I get?

687
01:24:14,528 --> 01:24:16,519
As many as you want.

688
01:24:17,249 --> 01:24:19,740
And the more wishes you make...

689
01:24:20,129 --> 01:24:23,758
...the more magnificent
Fantasia will become.

690
01:24:23,906 --> 01:24:25,066
Really?

691
01:24:25,921 --> 01:24:27,411
Try it.

692
01:24:40,034 --> 01:24:41,831
Then my first wish is...

693
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:53,562
Falkor, it's even more beautiful
than I thought!

694
01:25:04,034 --> 01:25:07,526
- Like it?
- Falkor, it's wonderful.

695
01:25:12,165 --> 01:25:15,828
Falkor, it's like the Nothing never was.

696
01:25:33,733 --> 01:25:35,894
Atreyu and Artax!

697
01:25:48,869 --> 01:25:51,861
What would you like to wish for next?

698
01:26:20,422 --> 01:26:22,413
Look, there they are.

699
01:26:23,783 --> 01:26:25,273
It's a monster!

700
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:30,144
Get them, Falkor!
Let's see how you like it, chickens.

701
01:26:30,279 --> 01:26:31,610
Down here.

702
01:26:45,576 --> 01:26:48,010
We're going to get you!

703
01:27:12,745 --> 01:27:14,906
<i>Bastian made many other wishes...</i>

704
01:27:15,433 --> 01:27:18,095
<i>... and had many other
amazing adventures...</i>

705
01:27:19,048 --> 01:27:22,040
<i>... before he finally returned
to the ordinary world.</i>

706
01:27:23,017 --> 01:27:25,542
<i>But that's another story.</i>

707
01:27:26,305 --> 01:27:32,917
