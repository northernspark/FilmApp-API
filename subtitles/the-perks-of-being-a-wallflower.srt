When he was a junior, Patrick started seeing
Brad on the weekends in secret.

get drunk every time they fooled around.

Brad said he loved Patrick.

that he still had to keep it a secret.

get her drunk at parties.

Well—

1293
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:21,076
There's this girl named Second Base Stace.

1294
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:24,829
And, well, she had boobs in 4th grade.

1295

Mosquito bites. Promising. Go.

1296
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:30,669
And she let some ofthe guys feel them.

1297
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:34,506
- That's your suburban legend?
- Yeah.

1298
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,008
- Did you at least cop a feel?
- No.

1299
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,719
No. Ofcourse not. You went home...

1300
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:42,514
listened to "Asleep," wrote a poem—

1301
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:44,641
Fine. Okay. Your turn.

1302
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:48,436
Hmm.

1303
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:51,564
Yeah. I've got one.

1304
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,318
Well...

1305
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:57,237
there's this one guy.

1306
01:16:57,321 --> 01:17:00,073
Queer as a 3-dollar bill.

1307
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:04,035
The guy's father doesn't know about his son.

1308
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:09,374
So he comes into the basement
one night when he's supposed to be out oftown.

1309
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,584
Catches his son with another boy.

1310
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,796
So he starts beating him.

1311
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,883
But not like the slap kind. Like, the real kind.

1312
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:26,725
And the boyfriend says,
"Stop. You're killing him."

1313
01:17:28,019 --> 01:17:30,603
But the son just yells, "Get out."

1314
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:35,108
And eventually...

1315
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:39,571
the boyfriend just did.

1316
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:48,371
Why can't you save anybody?

I'm free now, right?

1320
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:02,927
I could meet
the love of my life any second.

1321
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:06,556
Things will be different now and that's good.

1322
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,933

I've been spending a lot oftime with Patrick.

He begins every night really excited.

1328
01:18:40,758 --> 01:18:44,761
He always says he feels free
and tonight is his destiny.

1329
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:48,515
But after a while he runs out ofthings
to keep himself numb.

1330
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:53,812
And Sam got her letter from Penn State.

1331
01:19:00,194 --> 01:19:02,445
"We will require you to take
our summer session...

at the main campus immediately following
your high school graduation."

college and all their futures.

1337
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:30,014
Alice did get into NYU film school.

1338
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:32,225
Patrick is going to the
University ofWashington...

1339
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:35,979
because he wants to be
near the music in Seattle.

1340
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:41,067
But he wasn't going to leave
without organizing the best senior prank ever.

1341
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:50,034
Sam is going away right after graduation.

1342
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:52,287
It all feels very exciting.

1343
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:54,914
I just wish it were happening to me.

1344
01:19:54,999 --> 01:19:59,127
Especially because,
ever since I blacked out in the cafeteria...

1345
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:00,795
it's been getting worse.

There was this beautiful sunset.

And just a few hours before, everyone I love...

had their last day of high school ever.
