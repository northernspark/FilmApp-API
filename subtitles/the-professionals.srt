2
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,451
That's your man.

3
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:04,759
- Draw your pay.
- You wanted him broken.

4
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:07,422
Yeah, but not ruined.

5
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,830
Now, get out of here.

6
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,119
Mr. Marshall.

7
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,561
Ever heard of a J.W. Grant?

8
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,360
He needs you. Urgent.

9
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,910
My husband.

10
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:06,255
Hurry. Hurry.

11
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,823
Please, hurry.

12
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,763
Get out of here.

13
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,261
Baby!

14
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,710
It's nice to see you.

15
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:16,282
I'm Joe Grant.
Thank you for coming, Mr. Ehrengard.

16
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,647
Got your telegram, Mr. Grant.

17
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,317
It's a pleasure, Mr. Sharp.

18
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:15,279
Yeah. Me too, Lizzie.

19
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:19,009
Mr. Grant, I'm your local
bank representative.

20
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,813
As per your instructions,
this box contains...

21
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,885
Thank you for coming, Mr. Fardan.

22
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,457
The receipt, Mr. Grant.

23
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,357
Exactly $ 100,000 in gold coins.

24
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,626
Not a coin larger than $50.
That's quite an unusual request.

25
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:38,134
Thank you. Move out.

26
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,496
Mr. Grant. Slow freight ahead.

27
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,802
- Sidetrack it.
- You should count the money.

28
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:48,674
- Didn't you count it?
- Well, yes, of course, but...

29
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,552
Thank you.

Henry "Rico" Fardan. Virginia Military
Academy, Philippine campaign...

31
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,374
...Cuba with Roosevelt's Rough
Riders. Married a Mexican woman.

32
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,409
No children. Wife deceased.

33
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,573
Joined Pancho Villa
as weapons expert and tactician.

34
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,687
Your hair was darker then.

35
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,356
My heart was lighter then.

36
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,888
Left Villa's forces, June, 1915.

37
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,556
A year of wildcatting and prospecting.
Results: Negative.

38
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:46,171
Now demonstrating automatic
weapons. Salary: $40 a week.

Jacob Sharp. Specialist with rifle,
rope and longbow.

42
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,779
Most dependable scout and tracker
in the territory.

43
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,881
Any objections to working
with a Negro?

44
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,252
What's the job, Mr. Grant?

45
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,794
How well do you know him?

46
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,729
- Well enough.
- What's your feeling toward him?

47
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,271
I have the highest respect for him...

48
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,807
...as a soldier.

49
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:29,471
Last week, your respected soldier
kidnapped my wife.

50
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,581
His ransom note.

51
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,482
Your job:

52
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,317
A mission of mercy.

53
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:46,826
Raza. Captain Jesus Raza.

54
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,462
Jesus.

55
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:55,596
What a name for the bloodiest
cutthroat in Mexico.

56
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:14,385
Mrs. Grant is a prisoner
about 100 miles across this desert.

57
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,856
A hellhole. For Raza, a fortress.

58
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,192
He was born in that desert.

59
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:27,169
He and his men know every ravine,
every rock, every cliff.

60
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,070
It'd take a battalion at least a month.

61
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:33,675
But a few daring men...

62
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,974
...specialists, led by you...

63
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:41,176
...could do it in one bold, swift stroke.

64
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,654
Why not? You're fluent in Spanish.
You know the terrain.

65
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,316
You know Raza.
How he thinks and reacts.

66
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:53,522
- I know you can do it.
- I don't think so, Mr. Grant.

67
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,191
One thousand dollars a man going in.

68
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,930
If you bring her back safe and sound...

69
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,667
...another 9000 dollars
for each of you.

70
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:14,010
- How many men does Raza have?
- Pasqual?

71
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,916
Last month, 150, maybe. Now?

72
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:20,852
- If I were you, I'd pay the ransom.
- There it is.

73
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:26,966
One hundred thousand dollars
in gold coins, as requested by Raza.

74
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,560
Will that guarantee that she
won't be killed? You know Raza.

75
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,963
Say we were lucky enough
to get there.

76
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,474
How do we get your wife out? Safely?

77
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:44,412
Gentlemen, I don't know
where else to turn.

78
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,979
- What we really need is an equalizer.
- Name it.

79
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:52,984
A dynamiter with a delicate touch
to blow out a candle...

80
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,753
...without denting the candleholder.
- Who?

81
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,394
Him.

82
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,626
Arrange to have that man at the train
where we pick up the horses.

83
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,634
- Where is he?
- Not far.

84
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,171
- Get the details.
- In jail.

85
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:14,074
- In jail?
- He says that $ 700 will bail him out.

86
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,678
But is he dependable?
Can he be trusted?

87
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,785
I trust him.

88
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,646
Then you've got him.

89
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:10,531
- Rico, buddy, I don't deserve you.
- I agree.

90
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:20,169
I can understand you getting
into a crap game and losing $ 700...

91
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,645
...but how'd you lose your pants?
- In a lady's bedroom.

92
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,747
Trying to raise the cash.
Almost had it made too.

93
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:33,016
You realize people are the only
animals who make love face to face?

94
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,992
He's all yours.

95
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,525
Thanks. Again.

96
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,897
You could have telegraphed
the money yesterday.

97
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,369
Yesterday, I didn't have the money.

98
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,470
What's the proposition?

99
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,877
You won't lose your pants.

100
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:59,074
Your life, maybe, but... what's that?

101
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,384
Hardly anything at all.

102
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,621
- Well?
- Nice animals.

103
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:11,024
- Picked by Mr. Ortega.
- You can depend on them.

104
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:16,226
This one is Mrs. Grant's favorite.

105
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,633
Bred for speed.

106
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:23,571
He'll need a lot more than that
for this job.

107
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:29,579
- You'll have to make them do.
- Mr. Grant...

108
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:34,448
...I can make them go,
but I can't make them do.

109
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:40,754
$ 100,000 for a wife?
She must be a lot of woman.

110
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:44,259
Certain women have a way
of changing some boys into men...

111
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,161
...and some men back into boys.
- That's a woman worth saving.

112
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:52,634
- Where are we going?
- The Painted Mountains.

113
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,838
That's right.

114
00:12:55,107 --> 00:13:00,511
- You want us to go back to Mexico?
- This time strictly for cash.

115
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:06,777
- What's the deal?
- $ 10,000 per man, for nine days' work.

116
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:13,050
More money than we ever realized
out of all our schemes put together.

117
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,251
No detours!

118
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:20,694
I made us a contract. All the way.

119
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,859
- They know who took the woman?
- Raza.

120
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:33,008
Our Raza? A kidnapper?

121
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:37,673
- Grant's got a ransom note to prove it.
- Well, I'll be damned.

122
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,875
Most of us are.

123
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,123
Last week Mrs. Grant went riding.

124
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:20,923
Across the border.

125
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,827
She was born in Mexico.

126
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,528
I suppose she got lonely for it.

127
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,932
By the time we were alarmed,
the note of ransom arrived.

128
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,437
You'll want to know how she looks.

129
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:40,544
Those were taken four years ago
on our wedding day.

130
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:47,251
I guess I'm not much good without her.
Not anymore.

131
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:51,719
- What part of the hacienda is she kept?
- I'd only be guessing.

132
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,586
We have to know.

133
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,458
- The goat-keeper must know.
- Is he still there?

134
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:05,235
- What goat-keeper?
- By name, Padillia. Eduardo Padillia.

135
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:08,600
He was devoted to Mrs. Grant.

136
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:14,406
Twice a day he brought her
goat's milk. It was almost a ritual.

137
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,572
By this, he will know
you have my blessing.

138
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:28,216
Like myself, he would give his life
for the <i>señora</i>.

139
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:32,755
When you cross under that bridge,
you're in Mexico.

140
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:38,336
You'll leave as soon as it's dark.
It's safer to travel by night, rest by day.

141
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,709
Bring her back to me.

142
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,975
Please.

143
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,978
We've been following
the same tracks.

144
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,087
- Mexicans.
- How many horses?

145
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,846
Eight. More likely 10.

146
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,855
- How long ago?
- Couple hours.

147
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,792
- Which way they headed?
- Same as us, south. Only, circling.

148
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,100
Now, why should they circle?

149
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,096
Raza's men?

150
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,569
- Why not?
- This far north?

151
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,742
That's a good question.

152
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,107
Could be anybody. Even friendly.

153
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,915
- Could be.
- Jake, shag them. Look them over.

154
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,749
But just look.

155
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,719
We'll camp at Dead Man's Canyon.
Spot us by the Painted Hills.

156
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,687
I'll find you.

157
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:23,067
Rico. You know something?

158
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:26,295
Me and Raza are the two
most corruptible bums.

159
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,270
- We'd do most anything for money.
- And have.

160
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:33,434
But not kidnapping.
That's not our trade.

161
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,013
Why did Raza pick Grant's wife
to kidnap?

162
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,251
Company. Eight.
Next bend up ahead.

163
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:48,018
- Last night you saw tracks for 10.
- That's right.

164
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,192
- Any cover?
- Both sides.

165
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,793
Cut out your two horses
and the dynamite mule.

166
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:14,652
- Maybe they're just passing.
- If so, they'll ride in single file.

167
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:20,281
The leader in front, and they'll palaver.
If it's trouble, they'll come as a group.

168
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:25,055
If the leader takes his hat off and
passes it across to cover his gun...

169
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,425
...let go, fast.

170
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,804
- Bill, you take the point.
- They got bolt-action rifles.

171
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:50,749
- Same setup as Durango?
- Yeah. Why not?

172
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:05,067
- They're here.
- They're here.

173
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,999
Good morning, friends.

174
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,730
Good morning.

175
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,269
They're Americans.

176
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,772
- You got lost?
- Just looking for a place to camp.

177
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,509
What you got in those packs, boss?
Gold?

178
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,217
You got more gold in your teeth.

179
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,784
He says I've got more gold
in my teeth. How funny!

180
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:59,421
- It's very dangerous around here.
- Oh, that so?

181
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:03,152
Sure. Many bandits
hide in these mountains.

182
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,320
Very bad men.
They steal from anybody.

183
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:10,991
- Especially <i>gringos.</i>
- In that case, we'd better keep moving.

184
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,636
Go with God.

185
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,559
- That makes 10.
- That's right.

186
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,307
Shoot the horse. Shoot him!

187
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:19,699
- Bury them deep.
- Nine more of their horses are still left.

188
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:24,305
- You gonna shoot them too?
- We can't spare the food and water.

189
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,967
You can turn them loose.

190
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:30,112
- What's so funny?
- People.

191
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,715
We just killed 10 men.
Nobody bats an eye.

192
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:38,049
- When it comes to a stupid animal...
- But harmless.

193
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:42,523
Nothing's harmless in the desert,
unless it's dead.

194
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:46,097
Want to face another pack
of Raza's men?

195
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:50,667
- They'll head south, to camp.
- They'll head to the river, north.

196
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,532
Suppose they follow us? What then?

197
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,900
Then shoot them.

198
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,377
All right. Cut them loose.

199
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,072
God almighty.

200
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:08,842
I've known heat before, but this is...

201
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,284
I hate the desert.

202
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:20,488
It's got no pity.

203
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,158
Jake.

204
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:32,029
- Did he take his salt?
- I'll see that he gets some.

205
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:46,281
Let him sleep. You too.

206
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,567
How they taking it?

207
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,869
They'll be all right.

208
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,966
You'd better scout ahead tonight.

209
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,837
Now, beyond that ridge,
20 miles of salt flats.

210
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,883
Then 10 more of sand.
220 degrees south by southwest.

211
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:24,146
Our next layover, Coyote Pass.

212
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,589
The cemetery of nameless men.

213
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,225
We buried some fine friends there.

214
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,667
And some fine enemies.

215
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,998
That was a fine battle.

216
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:45,233
Outnumbered, outgunned,
and still we held that pass.

217
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:50,074
Yeah, but who cares now?
Or even remembers?

218
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,580
Now, take that ruckus this morning.

219
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:58,551
A year ago, those men would be
fighting federals instead of <i>gringos.</i>

220
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,419
- We were lucky.
- We were also stiffed.

221
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:05,393
They had us spotted back
where we picked up their trail.

222
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:11,366
- Why did they sucker us into this spot?
- You're leery about the setup too. So?

223
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:15,734
<i>Amigo</i>, three days' ride from
Coyote Pass is another graveyard.

224
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,741
But instead of dead heroes,
they buried gold bullion.

225
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:24,075
Two million in Spanish gold.
Melted down into beautiful bars.

226
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,912
Waiting for us.
We don't have to fight Raza to get it.

227
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:31,953
- It's not the reason you took this job.
- Got a better reason?

228
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:36,583
Our word. We gave our word
to bring the woman back.

229
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:42,796
My word to Grant
ain't worth a plugged nickel.

230
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:46,093
You gave your word to me.

231
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:09,647
Drink?

232
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,819
Thanks.

233
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,956
Yeah, takes getting used to.

234
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,390
Broiling by day. Freezing at night.
Alkali dust choking your body.

235
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,831
Who lives here long enough
to get used to it?

236
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:28,598
Men, tempered like steel,
a tough breed.

237
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,273
Men who've learned how to endure.

238
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:34,678
- Like you and Dolworth.
- Oh, no.

239
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,973
Men like Raza.

240
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:03,630
I wonder how long that's been there.

241
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,901
About an hour or so.
Dolworth put it there.

242
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:13,209
That means everything's all clear.
An upside-down cross means danger.

243
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:19,045
- Could've been put there by anybody.
- That's the idea.

244
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,548
Good morning, friend.

245
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:15,904
- Dolworth?
- Yeah.

246
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,634
- How many more?
- Three.

247
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,252
No guns.

248
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,863
- We that close to Raza?
- Could be.

249
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,277
At least I made out with a fine pistol.

250
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,790
We sure got lucky
with this <i>gringo</i>, eh?

251
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:11,759
No wonder my mother kicked me
out of the house!

252
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,832
- A bottle.
- You'd even frighten the dead!

253
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:20,695
Don't get carried away.

254
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,334
The bottle.

255
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,304
Where are your friends, <i>amigo</i>?

256
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:34,148
Here have a drink.
These shoes will be mine if they fit.

257
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:39,285
- Hey, don't I know you?
- Well, from here you look like me.

258
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,852
- Why you come to this place?
- You'll laugh.

259
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:52,331
It is not proper to laugh at a man
who is about to die.

260
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,438
I came because I'm crazy
about your tequila.

261
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,733
And I like your women.

262
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,510
See? You laugh.

263
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:06,540
What a funny guy, huh?

264
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:15,222
I'm gonna ask again.
Where are your friends?

265
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:18,362
I told you. I always travel alone.

266
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:24,195
It is a sacrilege to die
with a lie in your teeth.

267
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,294
See?

268
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:34,472
Those horses and six more
come back to us.

269
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:38,479
But where are the men
who ride them?

270
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:44,580
I don't think you kill 10 men
by yourself, buddy.

271
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,316
Hold it!

272
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,559
Stop!

273
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,421
I wouldn't do that.

274
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:02,165
My friend would die of a terrible
headache. And so would you.

275
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,837
And so would you.

276
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:15,385
So wouldn't it be more sensible
if we both kept our heads, huh?

277
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,317
Put down your gun.

278
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:23,323
If I did that, how do I know
that you would still be friendly?

279
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:31,395
Do I gotta kill you
to prove I like you?

280
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,094
Your gun, mister.

281
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,636
That's why I like this fool,
because he's intelligent.

282
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:41,106
- Behave!
- Behave. Let it drop.

283
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:44,881
That's why I like this one,
because he's so intelligent.

284
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,880
Thattaboy.

285
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,580
Come on, buddy.

286
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:51,716
Let it go already.

287
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,290
He's a good man after all.

288
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:27,480
You have to get over this habit
of losing your pants.

289
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:30,252
- It's not dignified.
- It's drafty too.

290
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:43,907
- Don't worry. This time I'll do it.
- This time we need them.

291
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,975
You all right?

292
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,014
Makes you wonder
how we ever beat the Indians.

293
00:35:58,022 --> 00:36:00,047
Thanks.

294
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,858
Interesting pass.

295
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,462
You should see it from upside down.

296
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:12,433
If we hightail it out of here in a hurry,
that doorway could save us hours.

297
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:17,805
It's the same shortcut for Raza.

298
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:21,536
Not if you rig it
so we slam that door in his face.

299
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,805
Yeah?

300
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,773
I'll take the first watch.

301
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:42,548
If it isn't hot, it's cold.
If it isn't cold, it's raining.

302
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,881
How bad is that horse?

303
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:49,185
- Not too good. No bottom.
- We could all do with a rest.

304
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:50,792
Yeah.

305
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:54,124
- A shave would be a relief.
- So would a bath.

306
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,527
Might as well throw in a woman.

307
00:38:56,701 --> 00:39:00,660
Any size, any age, any color.
Any woman.

308
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,799
Mr. D...

309
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:07,137
...whatever got a loving man like you
in the dynamite business?

310
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:11,577
I'll tell you. I was born
with a powerful passion to create.

311
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:14,980
I can't write, I can't paint,
I can't make up a song.

312
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:18,588
- So you explode things.
- That's how the world was born.

313
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,690
Biggest damn explosion ever.

314
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:24,056
Dynamite in the hands of a fool
means death.

315
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:28,590
In this case it could mean life. Ours.
If we're lucky...

316
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:32,361
...and get back to this rattrap,
it'll be touch-and-go.

317
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,198
All you gotta do is light this fuse.

318
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,536
You got 10 seconds to run like hell.

319
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:46,513
And then dynamite, not faith,
will move that mountain into this pass.

320
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,652
Peace, brother.

321
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,903
That track is the main line
to Mexico City.

322
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:16,136
According to this, Grant's railroad spur
branches off three miles up.

323
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:19,612
Beyond those hills... the hacienda.

324
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:26,913
Supply train.

325
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:31,455
- Government troops.
- Well, look here.

326
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:48,642
Raza.

327
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,967
Throw it!

328
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,339
Pull it!

329
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:30,609
- How are you, man?
- Good, chief. Thank you.

330
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:50,866
- Are they all <i>Colorados</i>?
- Yes, Captain, they all are.

331
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:56,196
Well, you know what to do.

332
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:34,975
- Justice.
- Shut up!

333
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:51,491
The men on that train are <i>Colorados.</i>
Expert marksmen.

334
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:54,290
Also expert at torture.

335
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:58,299
Years ago, they burned and looted
a town of 3000 people.

336
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:02,166
When they finished, 40 were left.

337
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:05,638
Fardan's wife was one of the lucky 40.

338
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,710
"Why are you a revolutionary?"
They asked her.

339
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:13,008
"To rid the world of scum like you,"
she said.

340
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,674
They stripped her naked...

341
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:20,119
...ran her through the cactus
until her flesh was...

342
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:26,326
The other 39 rebels
watched her die...

343
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,958
...and did nothing.

344
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,998
Just watched.

345
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:39,166
What were Americans
doing in a Mexican revolution?

346
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:45,914
Maybe there's only one revolution,
since the beginning.

347
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:49,018
The good guys against the bad guys.

348
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:53,088
The question is:
Who are the good guys?

349
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:29,919
- Juanito, to the north and south, okay?
- Got it.

350
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,440
About 60 horses, four burros.

351
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,614
Two machine guns from the train.

352
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:16,435
Jake.

353
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,268
Keep those horses quiet.

354
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:28,043
Get some more from the other side.
Hurry.

355
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:32,344
You rode well today, Chiquita.

356
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,319
Perfectly.

357
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,818
Beautiful.

358
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:46,598
- That Mrs. Grant?
- That is a soldier.

359
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:52,201
Lieutenant Si Si Chiquita.
Now, there's a woman worth a ransom.

360
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,367
She never says no.

361
00:46:57,614 --> 00:47:02,517
Before you blow a gasket,
think you can blow the water tower?

362
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:08,990
- How do you want it?
- Like it was hit with a French 75.

363
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:13,722
Mrs. Grant could be there.

364
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:18,898
- Seems the only likely place.
- The trouble is, we gotta be dead sure.

365
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:21,969
When we make our move,
there won't be time for guessing.

366
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,072
Coming through the gate.

367
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:29,406
- Morning. How's the wife and kids?
- Very good, very good.

368
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:32,707
Wow, there's a lot of you here.

369
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:42,917
Anybody see any cows?

370
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,060
No.

371
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:50,890
It's a cinch that milk didn't
come from the breast of a tin can.

372
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,663
Our friend, the goat-keeper.

373
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,293
Good morning, sir.

374
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:28,528
- What is your name?
- Eduardo Padillia, at your service.

375
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:31,902
Do you recognize this?

376
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,945
Friends of Mr. Ortega.

377
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:43,982
That's right.

378
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:48,714
The milk that you brought
to the hacienda this morning...

379
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:51,961
Who was that for?

380
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:57,999
- Who drinks it?
- Many people.

381
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,567
Anybody special?

382
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:06,340
The lady. <i>Señora</i> Grant.

383
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:11,811
She live in that room? You're sure?

384
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:16,112
- You have seen her?
- I know her from when she was born.

385
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:22,088
Her mother was dry. She was raised
on the milk of my goats.

386
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:25,625
- Is she well?
- Very well, considering.

387
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:28,965
We have come to help her.

388
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:32,132
Blessed be the Lord.

389
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:35,931
May God repay you. May God...

390
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:49,476
Raza has to expect one of two things:
A messenger with a ransom...

391
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,178
...or an attack from the <i>federales.</i>

392
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:55,382
We've gotta make him think
we're the Mexican army.

393
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:59,620
- The four of us?
- A whole battalion.

394
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:04,526
Now, how do the <i>federales</i>
start an attack? Artillery.

395
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:09,364
This is our battery of field guns.

396
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:12,736
First you hit him here. French 75s.
Then here, here, here.

397
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:15,139
Carefully avoiding Mrs. Grant.

398
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:19,840
- When they run to defend the...
- We rescue Little Red Riding Hood.

399
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:26,322
We can't fight our way in.
Diversion is our only chance.

400
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,856
Well?

401
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:35,892
Rico, buddy, I got one of my feelings.

402
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:39,229
Something's dicey about this.
Let's pull out.

403
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:47,903
If you can deliver this dynamite
with split-second timing...

404
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,239
...we can pull this job off.

405
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,459
Mr. D?

406
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:15,036
I guess we just gotta get lucky.

407
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:22,435
Jacob, this stick of dynamite
weighs exactly four ounces.

408
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:27,640
If you taped that to an arrow,
how far could you shoot it?

409
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:30,285
And hit the mark.

410
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:52,574
I don't like it.

411
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,078
- We get it wrong?
- Relax.

412
00:51:56,246 --> 00:52:02,082
The stuff you're handling is safe.
These beaded sticks are trickier.

413
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:04,413
It's the heat.

414
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:09,421
Makes them sweat. Nitro.

415
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:22,797
When they're dry and cool,
they're safe and obedient.

416
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,999
We'll leave these sweaty ones behind.

417
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:32,442
Ventilate them. Cool them.
Then maybe they'll behave.

418
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:35,549
I don't know whether it's me
or the dynamite...

419
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:38,153
...that's doing all that sweating.

420
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:49,232
Four men against so many.
How will you save the <i>señora</i>?

421
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:54,028
- I don't know yet.
- When will it happen?

422
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:58,538
- Tomorrow. Maybe the next day.
- Not before?

423
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:04,476
- There's much to prepare.
- Speak plainly, <i>señor.</i>

424
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:07,082
Am I your prisoner?

425
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:11,482
I want to help the <i>señora.</i>
But you make me feel unworthy.

426
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,646
Trouble!

427
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:26,764
Show us if you're worthy.
Go greet them.

428
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:31,907
And remember,
I speak your language.

429
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:44,487
They don't give good milk
if they're skinny.

430
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,634
What happened, old man?

431
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,038
Any news?

432
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:08,073
- Talk!
- Same as always. Very hot weather.

433
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,772
- Have you seen anyone around here?
- No.

434
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:13,313
A <i>gringo</i> maybe?

435
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,550
- <i>Gringo</i>?
- Yeah, a <i>gringo</i>.

436
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:23,385
Are you sure?

437
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:45,540
They killed and buried ten of our men.

438
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,941
They found the men
we buried in the canyon.

439
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,855
Am I worthy?

440
00:55:56,119 --> 00:56:00,818
If I were you, Jacob, I wouldn't use
any of these for firewood.

441
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:10,762
Excuse me. I am ready to leave.

442
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:16,093
- Shall I tell the <i>señora</i> of your coming?
- No.

443
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:20,606
- She might behave differently.
- I understand.

444
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:25,339
By tomorrow, God willing,
the <i>señora</i> will be safe.

445
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,178
Until later, then.

446
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,157
So you let him go.

447
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:41,055
They expect him to bring the milk.

448
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,699
To hell with the milk.

449
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:49,303
- What must he do to prove himself?
- He proved nothing.

450
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:52,464
He knew if he said a wrong word,
he'd be shot.

451
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:56,304
What were we to do?
Watch him all night, and tomorrow?

452
00:56:56,479 --> 00:57:01,712
When we go do the job, then what?
We take him with us? Tie him up?

453
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:06,288
Or were you planning killing him?
I wouldn't put that past you.

454
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:11,483
- I don't like it.
- All right.

455
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:14,322
We do the job tonight, as planned.

456
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:38,649
This fuse burns for 10 seconds.
Three seconds for flight of arrow?

457
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:41,518
- About.
- Once you light the fuse...

458
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:46,457
...you've got seven seconds to shoot.
- Clear.

459
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,930
Start shooting
as soon as the water tower blows.

460
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:55,793
These are your targets.
That's your position.

461
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:02,033
- I have 4:17.
- 4:20.

462
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:06,477
- 4:24.
- Set them at 4:30.

463
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:14,180
We should have an hour before dawn.
How much time do you need?

464
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:19,454
I'll be ready by 5:00. This fuse
will burn for half-hour exactly.

465
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:23,827
- Fireworks start at 5:30 sharp.
- Any questions?

466
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,903
- Machine gun over the lady's room?
- My job. Anything else?

467
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,875
Let's go to work.

468
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,609
Listen to me!

469
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:19,534
- Who are you looking for?
- Raza.

470
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:45,423
There are things that...

471
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:47,958
Captain.

472
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:49,588
What?

473
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,244
Carlos, I won't take long.

474
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:04,913
I know.

475
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:11,543
- How was it?
- Okay.

476
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:29,795
- Carlos?
- Yeah?

477
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:33,999
- Want some tequila?
- Oh, good. Thank you, friend.

478
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:09,511
Where are you all going?
I'm right here.

479
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:15,471
Good night.

480
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:19,776
- See the woman?
- Yes.

481
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:22,042
- Talk to her yet?
- No.

482
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:25,710
- How much time we got?
- About eight minutes.

483
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:28,287
- Listen to me!
- Go on.

484
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:29,986
- Go to hell!
- You go to hell!

485
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:32,251
I don't give a shit!

486
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:46,435
That Chiquita,
she can lick a whole regiment...

487
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:49,840
...but she can't dance a lick.

488
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:48,062
You. Go away!

489
01:07:55,438 --> 01:08:00,705
<i>Amigo,</i> we've been had.
Let's get the hell out of here.

490
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,728
- No.
- No!

491
01:10:57,152 --> 01:11:00,087
Do exactly as I said.

492
01:11:08,797 --> 01:11:10,458
The <i>señora</i>.

493
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:16,265
Speak only what I told you.
Nothing more, nothing less.

494
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:32,112
Call them.

495
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:40,091
Rico. All clear.

496
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:44,297
By the way, I forgot to bring
your wooden cross...

497
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:48,703
...your upside-down cross.

498
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:02,214
Cease fire!

499
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:05,119
Cease fire!
You're going to injure the <i>señora</i>.

500
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:08,522
- Cease fire!
- Cease fire!

501
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:16,364
They're afraid to hit the woman.

502
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:19,524
Your position is hopeless.

503
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,797
Put down your weapons.

504
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,371
Get up.

505
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:30,610
Come on, baby. Let's go.

506
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:36,213
Don't shoot.

507
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:52,525
Release the woman!

508
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:54,635
Release her!

509
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:00,872
Shoot.

510
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:02,567
Do as I say.

511
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:04,406
Shoot.

512
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:07,845
One shot from you, I'll kill her.

513
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:16,456
Get your men off that train.

514
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:18,558
Move!

515
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:20,727
Now!

516
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:22,523
Let's go! Outside.

517
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:37,939
Three against four. What happened?

518
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:45,388
- Feels like a busted rib.
- You're lucky.

519
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,222
The bullet went clean through.

520
01:17:53,135 --> 01:17:55,865
Your hands are filthy.

521
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:06,078
What's it to you if he lives or dies?

522
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:09,581
If he lives, we'll have to slow down.

523
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:14,154
That'll give Raza
a chance to catch up.

524
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:17,689
She'll work to keep him alive,
all right.

525
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:29,230
Yes?

526
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:31,939
Just wondering.

527
01:18:32,107 --> 01:18:35,076
What makes you worth
$ 100,000?

528
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:38,846
Go to hell.

529
01:18:39,981 --> 01:18:42,074
Yes, ma'am.

530
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:44,348
I'm on my way.

531
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,492
Thanks.

532
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:07,106
How is he?

533
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:10,733
He will never reach the border.
None of you.

534
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:16,979
You have no chance. You never did.

535
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:18,744
We knew everything.

536
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:22,754
From the moment you set foot
in <i>México.</i> Even before.

537
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:25,722
From the day
my husband sent for you.

538
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:27,828
Mr. Ortega.

539
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:30,657
He said he would
give his life for you.

540
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:36,065
For me, not my husband.
For Raza. For the revolution.

541
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:44,573
From the loyal Ortega to the devoted
goat-keeper, to the faithful wife...

542
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:50,946
...at the mercy of a brutal kidnapper.
That's one hell of a rigged parlay.

543
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:52,780
I was not kidnapped.

544
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,022
The old badger game.

545
01:19:56,191 --> 01:20:00,457
Shakedown partners, bed partners.

546
01:20:01,696 --> 01:20:03,687
Cozy.

547
01:20:04,866 --> 01:20:09,326
Raza and I grew up together.
I am born there.

548
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:15,374
When it's the hacienda of my father,
when Raza is only a stable boy.

549
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:20,605
We are lovers long before
Mr. Joe Grant buys the place.

550
01:20:21,383 --> 01:20:24,011
When my father lies dying, he says:

551
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:27,279
"Mr. Joe Grant wants you
for his wife."

552
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:33,951
"You will become <i>Doña Grant,</i>
a fine lady. That is my wish."

553
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:37,121
Here, a wish is a command.

554
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:41,531
But I'm very young and very foolish.

555
01:20:41,703 --> 01:20:45,503
I tell Mr. Joe Grant
I cannot marry to him.

556
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:48,302
I love another man.

557
01:20:50,879 --> 01:20:53,347
Very romantic, no?

558
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:05,717
Your husband sent you clothes.

559
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:08,658
I offer you a better bargain than I got.

560
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:14,063
Four lives. Yours, if you let me go.

561
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:17,672
You better change
before we start back.

562
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:20,706
It'll be a long ride
on your bare bottom.

563
01:21:34,756 --> 01:21:35,780
Raza!

564
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:39,017
- How much time have we got?
- None.

565
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,970
Get her out. Get her out!

566
01:22:41,356 --> 01:22:43,347
Mario!

567
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:43,469
Drink it.

568
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:46,309
See anything?

569
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:48,574
Sand.

570
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:51,081
They'll be along.

571
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:55,154
- How would they know which way?
- Raza will know.

572
01:24:55,356 --> 01:24:58,382
You should have let me finish him.

573
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:05,589
Why didn't you kill him?

574
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:08,133
You let Raza live.

575
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:10,100
Why?

576
01:25:11,072 --> 01:25:12,596
Shall I tell you?

577
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:17,507
You are simpatico. No man was more
loyal to the revolution than you.

578
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:20,474
I fought like any other man.

579
01:25:20,648 --> 01:25:25,745
Loyalty such as yours, that comes
only from devotion to a cause.

580
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:32,450
That same fire burns in Raza. That is
why you could not see him murdered.

581
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:37,155
He is a thief, trying to steal
100,000 dollars.

582
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:40,096
You are a whore
cheating on your husband.

583
01:25:40,268 --> 01:25:44,932
My husband stole millions
from this land, our land.

584
01:25:45,106 --> 01:25:49,941
If we can keep the revolution alive,
with that money, for just a day...

585
01:25:50,111 --> 01:25:55,174
...then I'll steal and cheat,
and whore...

586
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:58,911
...and anything else
that must be done.

587
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:06,857
You laugh. But you believed
in the revolution once.

588
01:26:07,428 --> 01:26:10,397
What else inspired you
to fight for us?

589
01:26:10,565 --> 01:26:12,726
Well, ma'am, I'll tell you.

590
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:19,339
I got inspired one day
in May, 1911, in El Paso.

591
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:24,706
It started suddenly. Shooting, yelling,
bombs going across the Rio Grande.

592
01:26:24,879 --> 01:26:28,975
Everybody ran to see what
the ruckus was about. Me too.

593
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:32,517
From the top of freight cars
we saw across the river.

594
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:38,887
The <i>Maderistas</i> were taking Juárez.
The revolution had busted wide open.

595
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:41,392
It was beautiful.

596
01:26:41,563 --> 01:26:45,499
The next thing I know I was
across the border shooting...

597
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:48,727
...with everybody and yelling,
"<i>Viva México.</i>"

598
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:54,702
A month later I was
blowing up trains for Villa.

599
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:56,673
Yes?

600
01:26:58,479 --> 01:26:59,946
That's it.

601
01:27:00,114 --> 01:27:02,344
Nothing more?

602
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:05,782
Not even money?

603
01:27:07,288 --> 01:27:09,688
Promised, never paid.

604
01:27:09,857 --> 01:27:12,553
But you stayed. You and this one.

605
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:16,218
And fought for six years,
the worst years.

606
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:21,027
It's not our war anymore, Mrs. Grant.

607
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:23,598
Him, I understand.

608
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:26,865
An adventurer without principles.

609
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:28,201
But you?

610
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:30,867
Change your clothes.

611
01:27:31,045 --> 01:27:32,808
We're leaving.

612
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:49,953
Raza says you
and he were good friends.

613
01:27:50,131 --> 01:27:54,625
- That's right.
- And yet, you would have killed him.

614
01:27:54,802 --> 01:27:56,292
That's right.

615
01:27:56,471 --> 01:27:57,563
For money.

616
01:27:58,673 --> 01:28:00,470
That's right.

617
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:23,294
For as much money,
would you let me go?

618
01:28:29,704 --> 01:28:35,267
- How long since you had a woman?
- Too long.

619
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:37,308
You want me?

620
01:28:41,282 --> 01:28:43,682
My price is high.

621
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:50,552
Freedom.

622
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:54,957
I might say yes now
and later, no.

623
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:58,861
I trust you.

624
01:29:29,997 --> 01:29:32,488
I trust you too.

625
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:40,902
You heard the man. We're leaving.

626
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:03,814
Finished.

627
01:31:20,241 --> 01:31:24,610
Try a little salt, ma'am.
Make you feel better.

628
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:40,621
Ma'am...

629
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:43,855
Sorry about your horse, ma'am.

630
01:31:58,312 --> 01:32:01,907
- You know something, Rico?
- Here.

631
01:32:02,884 --> 01:32:05,045
That's a lot of woman there.

632
01:32:05,887 --> 01:32:11,257
Beautiful. Classy. And guts.

633
01:32:11,425 --> 01:32:14,883
Hard enough to kill you,
and soft enough to change you.

634
01:32:15,062 --> 01:32:18,259
Reminds me of another Maria.
Yours.

635
01:32:18,432 --> 01:32:21,595
<i>Amigo,</i> don't con me.

636
01:32:21,802 --> 01:32:26,000
She's going back. If I have
to do it alone, she's going back.

637
01:32:26,173 --> 01:32:28,869
That's what I wanted to hear you say.

638
01:32:29,043 --> 01:32:32,410
What is on your mind besides
100-proof women, 90-proof whiskey...

639
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:35,242
...and 14-carat gold?

640
01:32:35,416 --> 01:32:37,247
<i>Amigo...</i>

641
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:41,355
...you just wrote my epitaph.

642
01:33:37,912 --> 01:33:41,177
- How many men?
- Raza and six. Pushing hard.

643
01:33:43,985 --> 01:33:45,816
Moving out.

644
01:33:50,324 --> 01:33:53,657
To make the border,
we gotta be out in three hours.

645
01:33:53,828 --> 01:33:57,195
We got an hour, maybe less.

646
01:33:57,398 --> 01:33:59,161
You have lost.

647
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:09,501
Win or lose, here and now.

648
01:34:09,677 --> 01:34:13,169
Bottleneck like this,
one of us might hold them off.

649
01:34:13,347 --> 01:34:15,372
- One of us.
- If he plays it cool.

650
01:34:15,549 --> 01:34:18,416
Hit and run. Stall and retreat.

651
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:39,663
Ehrengard needs help.
That's Jake's job.

652
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,468
The woman has to be watched.
That's your job.

653
01:34:42,643 --> 01:34:46,841
- Buying the time we need is my job.
- Whoa, <i>amigo.</i> Slow down.

654
01:34:47,014 --> 01:34:52,475
Let's keep this professional. Your job
is to make good our contract.

655
01:34:52,653 --> 01:34:55,178
To deliver the goods. All the way.

656
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:58,992
That's your job.

657
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:06,531
I got 9000 bucks coming.
In hard cash, please.

658
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:10,467
Take my horse.
You'll need him if Raza gets past me.

659
01:35:11,005 --> 01:35:12,097
Bill.

660
01:35:14,075 --> 01:35:15,906
See you.

661
01:35:16,877 --> 01:35:19,038
Jake.

662
01:35:21,482 --> 01:35:24,747
How are you going to make it back?

663
01:35:24,919 --> 01:35:27,285
Well, how were you?

664
01:37:33,547 --> 01:37:34,605
No!

665
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:39,653
Come on! Go on!

666
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:11,413
Sons of bitches.
Show your faces, bastards.

667
01:39:37,304 --> 01:39:40,000
- Fierro!
- I got one of them.

668
01:39:45,746 --> 01:39:48,271
Francisco!

669
01:39:51,618 --> 01:39:53,518
Where are they?

670
01:39:53,687 --> 01:39:57,885
Speak, man. Their positions!

671
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:07,126
Rico!

672
01:40:08,502 --> 01:40:10,970
Fierro, is he finished?

673
01:40:11,138 --> 01:40:12,628
Not yet, baby.

674
01:40:15,476 --> 01:40:17,068
Baby.

675
01:40:32,993 --> 01:40:35,689
<i>Amigo.</i>

676
01:40:35,863 --> 01:40:39,594
So you are the one
they left to die, huh?

677
01:40:45,406 --> 01:40:48,432
Where did the bullet bite you?

678
01:40:48,609 --> 01:40:50,668
In the ass.

679
01:40:50,844 --> 01:40:51,868
You?

680
01:40:55,215 --> 01:40:58,013
Another two inches, <i>mamacita.</i>

681
01:41:08,095 --> 01:41:11,428
Could you spare one more <i>cigarro</i>?

682
01:41:12,699 --> 01:41:14,860
Why, sure.

683
01:41:15,035 --> 01:41:16,229
Come and get it.

684
01:41:17,404 --> 01:41:18,598
Hey, Fierro!

685
01:41:20,707 --> 01:41:25,371
- You want tobacco?
- Smoking is bad for the health.

686
01:41:41,962 --> 01:41:47,161
How do you come
to this dirty business?

687
01:41:47,367 --> 01:41:49,392
The usual.

688
01:41:49,603 --> 01:41:50,865
Money.

689
01:41:51,805 --> 01:41:54,137
Everything is as usual.

690
01:41:54,308 --> 01:41:59,678
I need guns and bullets, as usual.

691
01:42:00,447 --> 01:42:05,146
The war goes badly, as usual.

692
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:07,412
Only you...

693
01:42:07,588 --> 01:42:10,455
...you are not as usual.

694
01:42:13,327 --> 01:42:14,385
Chiquita!

695
01:44:06,106 --> 01:44:08,131
Chiquita!

696
01:44:08,909 --> 01:44:11,605
How's your love life?

697
01:44:11,778 --> 01:44:13,268
Terrific.

698
01:44:13,914 --> 01:44:15,108
You want some?

699
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:18,714
Don't you ever say no?

700
01:44:18,885 --> 01:44:20,750
- Never.
- Anybody?

701
01:44:20,921 --> 01:44:23,754
Everybody!

702
01:44:29,396 --> 01:44:34,834
You know, of course,
one of us must die.

703
01:44:36,303 --> 01:44:38,567
Maybe both of us.

704
01:44:42,175 --> 01:44:45,110
To die for money is foolish.

705
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:48,806
To die for a woman is more foolish.

706
01:44:48,982 --> 01:44:51,450
Any woman, even her.

707
01:44:51,618 --> 01:44:53,916
How long you think to hold us here?

708
01:44:54,087 --> 01:44:56,487
Oh, a couple of hours.

709
01:44:56,657 --> 01:44:59,649
Then what happens
here won't matter.

710
01:45:00,193 --> 01:45:02,661
She'll be Mrs. Joe Grant again.

711
01:45:07,367 --> 01:45:09,597
But that will change nothing.

712
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:13,831
She is my woman.
Before. Now. Always.

713
01:45:14,007 --> 01:45:16,373
Nothing is for always.

714
01:45:16,576 --> 01:45:18,976
Except death.

715
01:45:19,146 --> 01:45:21,614
Ask Fierro. Ask Francisco.

716
01:45:21,782 --> 01:45:25,274
Ask those in the
cemetery of nameless men.

717
01:45:25,452 --> 01:45:31,186
- They died for what they believed.
- The revolution?

718
01:45:31,658 --> 01:45:34,525
When the shooting stops
and the dead buried...

719
01:45:34,695 --> 01:45:40,292
...and the politicians take over, it all
adds up to one thing, a lost cause.

720
01:45:40,467 --> 01:45:42,526
So...

721
01:45:42,703 --> 01:45:46,799
You want perfection or nothing.

722
01:45:48,008 --> 01:45:50,704
You're too romantic, <i>compadre.</i>

723
01:45:50,877 --> 01:45:55,041
<i>La Revolución</i>
is like a great love affair.

724
01:45:55,215 --> 01:45:58,207
In the beginning, she is a goddess.

725
01:45:58,385 --> 01:46:04,813
A holy cause. But every
love affair has a terrible enemy.

726
01:46:04,991 --> 01:46:06,618
Time.

727
01:46:07,527 --> 01:46:10,496
We see her as she is.

728
01:46:14,935 --> 01:46:18,666
<i>La Revolución</i> is not a goddess,
but a whore.

729
01:46:18,839 --> 01:46:22,707
She was never pure,
never saintly, never perfect.

730
01:46:22,876 --> 01:46:26,778
So we run away.
Find another lover, another cause.

731
01:46:26,947 --> 01:46:29,848
Quick, sordid affairs.

732
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:31,916
Lust, but no love.

733
01:46:32,085 --> 01:46:36,283
Passion, but no compassion.

734
01:46:37,657 --> 01:46:39,921
Without love...

735
01:46:40,794 --> 01:46:45,060
...without a cause, we are nothing.

736
01:46:50,771 --> 01:46:53,433
We stay because we believe.

737
01:46:53,607 --> 01:46:56,804
We leave because
we are disillusioned.

738
01:46:56,977 --> 01:47:00,674
We come back because we are lost.

739
01:47:01,581 --> 01:47:04,812
We die because we are committed.

740
01:47:19,966 --> 01:47:22,400
You and I together.

741
01:47:22,569 --> 01:47:23,900
I to the front.

742
01:47:24,070 --> 01:47:26,903
- I will go first.
- Do as I say, woman!

743
01:47:27,073 --> 01:47:29,837
A woman he will not shoot.

744
01:47:51,364 --> 01:47:53,161
Jesús!

745
01:48:08,281 --> 01:48:10,306
Hello, baby.

746
01:48:11,785 --> 01:48:14,276
Hello, baby.

747
01:48:16,623 --> 01:48:21,617
Long time since I hear "baby."

748
01:48:25,065 --> 01:48:29,058
Hey, you ever find...

749
01:48:29,269 --> 01:48:32,796
...that damn gold mine?

750
01:48:48,488 --> 01:48:51,286
I am not lucky today.

751
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:55,419
But you're beautiful.

752
01:48:56,396 --> 01:48:59,024
<i>Querido,</i> baby.

753
01:49:00,534 --> 01:49:05,494
We had some fine times together.

754
01:49:05,705 --> 01:49:07,002
Terrific.

755
01:49:09,943 --> 01:49:12,571
Give us a kiss.

756
01:50:40,033 --> 01:50:43,025
Mrs. Grant, let's go.

757
01:50:43,503 --> 01:50:46,131
As long as we're
not pressed for time.

758
01:50:46,306 --> 01:50:49,139
Well, in a few minutes she'll be home.

759
01:50:51,678 --> 01:50:54,647
Be nice if Bill
was here for the payoff.

760
01:50:55,048 --> 01:50:57,642
Be nice if he was here alive.

761
01:50:57,817 --> 01:51:00,718
But stalling around won't make it so.

762
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:05,414
A cloud of dust. Could be Mr. Raza.

763
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:10,324
Could be most anything.

764
01:51:10,730 --> 01:51:12,459
Even a whirling dervish.

765
01:51:20,707 --> 01:51:25,542
That, gentlemen,
is the whirlingest dervish of them all.

766
01:51:29,949 --> 01:51:34,318
- Never thought he'd get out alive.
- And that, gentlemen...

767
01:51:34,487 --> 01:51:37,183
...calls for a celebration.

768
01:52:27,874 --> 01:52:30,570
What's that supposed to mean?

769
01:52:30,744 --> 01:52:35,238
Rico, buddy, this will come
as a shock to both of us.

770
01:52:35,415 --> 01:52:40,717
- I'm a born sucker for love.
- That bullet knocked your brains out.

771
01:52:40,887 --> 01:52:41,979
Or let some in.

772
01:52:42,155 --> 01:52:45,420
What happened back there?
What changed your mind?

773
01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:51,961
I found out what makes a woman
worth 100,000 dollars.

774
01:52:52,132 --> 01:52:55,329
You expect me to turn her loose?

775
01:52:55,735 --> 01:52:59,637
Turn her loose? After all we've
been through together?

776
01:52:59,806 --> 01:53:03,640
After all the blood it's cost?
Hell, no!

777
01:53:04,811 --> 01:53:09,544
You made a contract to kidnap
a wife for Mr. J.W. Grant.

778
01:53:12,685 --> 01:53:15,245
Now, let's collect that ransom.

779
01:53:25,431 --> 01:53:28,491
Thank you, from the bottom
of my heart. Thank you.

780
01:53:28,668 --> 01:53:31,136
Nicked you a bit, did they?

781
01:53:31,304 --> 01:53:32,328
Help yourself.

782
01:53:33,673 --> 01:53:36,141
- I'll get Mrs. Grant.
- That isn't necessary.

783
01:53:36,309 --> 01:53:40,336
Hooper! Escort these men
into town. See they're paid in full.

784
01:53:40,513 --> 01:53:46,008
Charge hotel bills, whiskey bills,
girl bills, all bills. Anything. On me.

785
01:53:46,186 --> 01:53:49,212
You must be anxious
to get a hot bath...

786
01:53:49,389 --> 01:53:52,620
...so it'll have to be <i>adiós</i>
and <i>muchas gracias.</i>

787
01:53:53,526 --> 01:53:56,552
- A hot bath.
- Why? Is it Saturday?

788
01:53:56,729 --> 01:54:00,324
You did your job and earned
a bust-out. Those are orders.

789
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:03,200
The contract is not complete until...

790
01:54:03,403 --> 01:54:06,236
...Mrs. Grant is delivered
safe and sound.

791
01:54:06,406 --> 01:54:10,240
- The code of the profession?
- Something like that.

792
01:54:10,410 --> 01:54:16,007
Very well. I hereby declare
our contract satisfactorily concluded.

793
01:54:16,182 --> 01:54:19,083
Not yet. Mrs. Grant...

794
01:54:19,252 --> 01:54:21,083
Thank you.

795
01:54:21,254 --> 01:54:22,744
Maria!

796
01:54:31,197 --> 01:54:33,927
- Hooper.
- Yes, sir.

797
01:54:35,235 --> 01:54:37,203
Kill him.

798
01:54:48,414 --> 01:54:49,438
No, no.

799
01:54:52,852 --> 01:54:55,787
You haven't earned
the right to kill him.

800
01:55:00,393 --> 01:55:03,021
If it's not too much, I want privacy.

801
01:55:03,196 --> 01:55:04,458
- Joseph!
- Not now.

802
01:55:04,664 --> 01:55:07,792
There is nothing to hide.
They know everything.

803
01:55:10,203 --> 01:55:11,568
Everything.

804
01:55:15,808 --> 01:55:18,709
You're back again.
Nothing else matters.

805
01:55:18,878 --> 01:55:21,870
I will run away again. That matters.

806
01:55:22,048 --> 01:55:24,414
You're my wife. You belong to me.

807
01:55:24,584 --> 01:55:25,812
I belong here.

808
01:55:25,985 --> 01:55:27,919
- With him?
- With him.

809
01:55:28,087 --> 01:55:30,988
I'd rather see you dead.
You're coming with me!

810
01:55:31,190 --> 01:55:32,418
You're going home!

811
01:55:32,592 --> 01:55:34,583
- No!
- Yes!

812
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:47,598
Gentlemen, you heard our employer.

813
01:55:47,774 --> 01:55:50,208
The lady's going home.

814
01:55:57,016 --> 01:56:00,349
Did you think J.W. Grant was
stupid enough to pay that ransom?

815
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:01,782
Certainly not.

816
01:56:04,757 --> 01:56:06,657
There was no kidnapping.

817
01:56:06,826 --> 01:56:08,293
Right, Mr. Grant?

818
01:56:13,132 --> 01:56:16,499
- Right, Mr. Grant?
- That is none of your business.

819
01:56:16,669 --> 01:56:18,227
Wrong, Mr. Grant.

820
01:56:18,504 --> 01:56:23,601
We made a contract to save
a lady from a nasty old kidnapper.

821
01:56:23,776 --> 01:56:26,438
Who turns out to be you.

822
01:56:35,488 --> 01:56:37,956
We both made a bad deal, Mr. Grant.

823
01:56:38,124 --> 01:56:43,187
You lose a wife, and we lose
10,000 dollars apiece.

824
01:56:44,063 --> 01:56:47,032
You bastard!

825
01:56:47,834 --> 01:56:51,361
Yes, sir.
In my case, an accident of birth.

826
01:56:51,537 --> 01:56:56,839
But you, sir,
you're a self-made man.

827
