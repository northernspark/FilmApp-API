Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,131
What's going on?
Are you getting this?

3
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,850
Whoa.
What's he doing?

4
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,800
Do you think
they'll let us pass?

5
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,171
It doesn't
look like it.

6
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,087
Are you good to go?

7
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,241
Yeah, rolling.

8
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,368
Hidden within this
sprawling desert,

9
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,205
250 miles south of Cairo...

10
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,488
the public will
soon lay their eyes

11
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,642
on the Holdens'
groundbreaking research...

12
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,285
and the father-daughter team

13
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,488
could rewrite history
as we know it.

14
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,690
As you can see,
the pyramid behind me
has only three sides...

15
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,042
not four like
the Giza Pyramids.

16
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,601
This architectural feat
singles it out

17
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,409
as an exception
in this region.

18
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,840
You're gonna
have to start over.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,920
The barking is covering
everything you're saying.

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,207
Oh, damn it.
What's wrong with those dogs?

21
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,606
Whose are they,
anyway?

22
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,489
They're just feral dogs
running around.

23
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,963
Can someone get
a shotgun or something

24
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,963
and get rid of
these dogs, please?

25
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,846
Driving me crazy.

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,570
All right, let's go again.

27
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,009
Okay, Sunni.
Whenever you're ready,
we're good to go.

28
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,084
Okay.
The way this works is,
I'll ask you a question...

29
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,129
you try to incorporate the
question into your response.

30
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,850
Like if I ask you
your name, you would say...

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,923
Dr. Miles Holden.
Wrong.

32
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,561
Oh. Oh, right.
Uh, my name is
Dr. Miles Holden.

33
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,410
That's what
I'm talking about.

34
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,642
Could you tell us what
exactly you're looking for?

35
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,326
Yeah. Uh, there are
certain ancient texts

36
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,289
which refer to this
geographic area...

37
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,041
<i>as</i> the possible site of the
lost pyramid of Akhenaten...

38
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,121
which may be related...

39
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,009
to the particular
and unusual

40
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,401
three-sided architecture
of our pyramid.

41
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,686
I just need to quickly
check your mic.

42
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,763
Yeah. It's a little
windy out here.

43
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,207
It's a great shot.
Just don't step backwards.

44
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,801
Yeah, okay.
You tell me when.
Uh...

45
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,928
Pyramids. Hit me with it.

46
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,846
Action.

47
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,565
Whatever we're looking at,

48
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,120
this is not the pyramid
of King Akhenaten.

49
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,363
The structure that we're dealing
with is buried below the surface.

50
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,205
It takes millennia for sand
to build up that high.

51
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,488
Which means that
this structure predates

52
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,410
the reign of Akhenaten
by generations.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,810
Why are so many people
against the satellites?

54
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,606
Most archaeologists
are trapped in time

55
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,728
when it comes to
reworking methodologies...

56
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,769
and assimilating
new evidence

57
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,922
into existing historical
frameworks. Mmm.

58
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,969
Proving an
older genealogy

59
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,441
for Egyptian history
basically means...

60
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,364
throwing everything
they have been

61
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,681
working on their
entire lives into question.

62
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,763
Isn't that what
you're trying to do?

63
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,406
No, not exactly.

64
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,006
I respect the work
that they have done...

65
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,640
but we just need to know
when it's time to innovate.

66
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,450
Most of our pyramid is
buried deep beneath the desert.

67
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,125
Here is a scan.

68
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,326
Look at the size
of that thing!

69
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,569
That's got to be
600 feet on each side.

70
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,449
See this tunnel here?
This is our way in.

71
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,280
It leads directly
to the apex of the pyramid.

72
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,367
The apex?

73
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,646
It's the tip
of the pyramid.

74
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,201
Mmm. Pyramids don't normally
have apexes at the entrance.

75
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,283
But this one does.
Who dug the tunnel?

76
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,807
We don't know yet.
That's also part of our discovery.

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,207
Nora, tell me
about the satellites.

78
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,930
I'm not the first
archaeologist

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,680
to break ground using
satellite technology.

80
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,450
But I was inspired
to apply it...

81
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,080
after an article that I read
about SETI out of New Mexico.

82
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,241
SETI?

83
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,761
"Search for Extraterrestrial
intelligence."

84
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,200
They were using
the satellites...

85
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,886
to search for traces of water
underneath the surface of Mars.

86
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,200
I thought we were here to
talk about Egypt, not aliens.

87
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,960
What do you think
about all those theories?

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,240
About aliens
coming to Earth?

89
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,841
And that the pyramids
are just giant transmitters?

90
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,646
Whoa, come on.
Even I have my limits.

91
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,930
Do you see, uh,
how these ridges

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,570
form a barrier
around the pyramid?

93
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,051
Dad.Dad.

94
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,044
Could you please stop touching
buttons that you don't understand?

95
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,121
Ooh.

96
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,806
Where was that taken?

97
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,126
It doesn't matter
when it was taken.

98
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,691
I said where.

99
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,201
This technology,
the satellite stuff...

100
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,960
is such a small part
of what we're doing.

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,002
We should be talking
about archaeology,

102
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,764
about the pyramid,
about Akhenaten, and...

103
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,809
Actually,
the whole satellite angle...

104
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,920
is what interested the
network in the first place.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,002
It's the dawn of a new age
in archaeology.

106
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,447
Using the future
to understand the past.

107
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,602
Anything else I'm not
supposed to see?

108
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,242
Would you just mind
your own business?
Thank you very much.

109
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,364
I'm sorry.
You are my business, all right?

110
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,282
Archaeology used to be
about digs and dirt.

111
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,010
But we've lost
the raw sensation

112
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,770
with all this
technological mediation.

113
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,441
Great.

114
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,366
Uh, how was that, Fitz?

115
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,045
Oh, it was
award-winning.

116
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,931
Okay. Let's wrap up.
We're done for the day.

117
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,891
Sorry.

118
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,201
Hey.

119
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,165
No, I'm fine, Mom.

120
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,402
I'm fine. Don't worry.

121
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,484
Cairo is far, far away.

122
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,170
And we're supposed
to break through tomorrow.

123
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,527
So if we get far enough,
we'll be safer underground...

124
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,165
than we will be
in a war bunker.

125
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,164
No, I'm not
taking it lightly.

126
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,640
I'm just trying
to focus on my work.

127
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,205
Could you please not worry?

128
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,567
You know Dad is enough
to handle as it is.

129
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,765
Okay. I love you, too. I do.

130
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,285
All right, tell...

131
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,171
Uh, Mom, I have to go.
I'll call you tomorrow.

132
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,560
I love you. Bye.

133
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,371
Zahir, get your
metallic junk out of here.

134
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,206
Jesus!

135
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,805
What the hell is that?

136
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,761
Whoa.

137
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,682
Uh, allow me to
introduce you to Shorty.

138
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,808
He's gonna be our first set
of eyes and ears inside...

139
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,008
after we make
initial breakthrough.

140
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,322
He stands just over
one foot tall...

141
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,324
with six wheels on a Rocker-Bogie
suspension system...

142
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,891
which was originally
designed

143
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,371
by NASA for their
Mars rovers...

144
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,680
to allow them to travel over
the rough Martian terrain.

145
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,291
I bet this thing
is a real babe magnet, eh?

146
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,605
Uh, some of the missions
Shorty has been on are...

147
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,491
Michael Zahir,
our robotics engineer.

148
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,085
But it seems
he wasn't briefed...

149
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,844
on which
million-dollar territories

150
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,285
he would be exploring.

151
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,930
Oh, don't you worry,
Nora.

152
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,491
I've got two
primary camera feeds...

153
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,411
sending back real-time footage
to our command center.

154
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,849
So everything Shorty sees
is permanently recorded.

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,081
Right, partner?

156
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,808
- Look out.
- Cute.

157
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,291
Look out.

158
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,563
We're not shooting
<i>Days Of Our Lives.</i>

159
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,802
Stop wasting
your memory space.

160
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,086
Oh, come on.

161
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,050
People would love to see
these two nerds get freaky.

162
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,203
Dr. Holden!
Dr. Holden!

163
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,600
Wait,
what's he saying?

164
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,846
We break through!

165
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,367
What? Come on!
Come on!

166
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,846
Are you all right?
Give me your hand.

167
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,047
- You got it?
- Yeah.

168
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,367
Slow down,
slow down.

169
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,771
You coming?

170
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,362
Tell them not to open it up yet.
Tell them to hold off.

171
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,726
Yeah, hold Off!

172
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,769
Zahir,
I need you to translate.

173
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,440
You got it?

174
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,366
Here it comes.

175
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,287
Jesus!

176
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,760
Get him out of here!

177
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,921
We have to get him
to medical!

178
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,643
Oh, my God.
We have to do something!

179
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,887
- He's alive.
- Oh.

180
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Thank God.

181
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,570
So what happened to him?
Aspergillus.

182
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,721
What's aspergillus?

183
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,484
Inhalation
of toxic air.

184
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,404
It's actually not as
uncommon as it sounds.

185
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,561
What causes it?

186
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,087
A fungi usually found
in caves and tombs...

187
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,964
structures that
have been sealed off.

188
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,971
This pyramid
could be way older

189
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,400
than even I had
originally thought.

190
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,761
Nora, please.
Stop spinning out
your wild theories.

191
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,285
I am trying to
reassure the university...

192
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,727
that we're going to be
doing things on schedule.

193
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,928
And that
has to be turned off.

194
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,570
Nobody goes
near that pyramid

195
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,926
without my permission,
all right?

196
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,651
And nobody mentions the
word "curse." Understood?

197
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,844
I don't want any of that
crazy nonsense on my site.

198
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,201
Our site.

199
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,005
Goddamn sand.

200
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,281
What?

201
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,161
What?

202
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,040
What's wrong?

203
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,005
What's wrong?

204
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,567
You can't shut us down.

205
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,051
We're about to
launch Shorty.

206
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,083
<i>It's not us,
it's the government.</i>

207
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,480
<i>The Ministry of Antiquities</i>

208
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,005
<i>is ordering all
research teams in the area...</i>

209
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,844
<i>to pull out immediately.</i>

210
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,886
<i>They want you
cleared out in 24 hours.</i>

211
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,611
When will we be able
to resume the excavation?

212
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,290
<i>We don't know yet.</i>

213
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,727
I'm sorry, what?
I don't understand.

214
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,484
<i>You've been in
the desert too long.</i>

215
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,887
<i>You should see what's happening
in the streets of Cairo.</i>

216
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,041
<i>It's mayhem.</i>

217
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,727
<i>Wide-scale violence between the
military and the protesters.</i>

218
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,006
<i>They're fearing a civil war.</i>

219
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,207
But this isn't Cairo.

220
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,725
Yeah, we are in the
middle of the desert.

221
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,881
<i>You don't get it.</i>

222
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,970
<i>I'm sorry, Miles,</i>

223
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,008
<i>but you have to be out
by tomorrow morning.</i>

224
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,731
God.
We are so close!

225
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,325
There goes my Emmy.

226
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,323
Nora, this is not
a discussion.

227
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,243
The final answer is no.
Thank you.

228
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,082
Would you please hand these out
to everybody you see around here?

229
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,651
This place needs to

230
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,324
look like we were
never here by morning.

231
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,481
What is going on?

232
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,846
It's all written down there.
This is not a conference.

233
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,400
Now just go, please.

234
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,925
So, that's it?

235
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,371
Oh, what would you
like me to do?

236
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,010
How about anything?

237
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,366
You barely
put up a fight.

238
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,006
I don't fight battles
I can't win.

239
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,969
I have got a career
to think of,
and so do you.

240
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,929
Don't forget that!
Okay.

241
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,127
But we can't walk away from
here with nothing to show.

242
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,321
I am not...

243
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,563
Dad, please!
This is the find of the century.

244
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,610
And you're going to give
up when we are this close.

245
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,569
We owe this to our name.

246
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,921
What's the harm?

247
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,770
Besides toxic air poisoning?

248
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,122
We won't go in ourselves.

249
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,930
We'll just send in Shorty.

250
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,481
He can take some readings
and some pictures.

251
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,570
A couple of hours.

252
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,321
Nobody will even know
that we were gone.

253
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,684
Dad, I know
what you're thinking.

254
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,925
Look me in the eye
and tell me...

255
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,765
that you don't wanna see what's
going on in that pyramid.

256
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,770
Trust me.

257
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,805
- Got it?
- Yeah.

258
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,766
Yes!

259
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,604
Guys, uh, Captain
Egypt is following you,

260
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,364
and he doesn't look happy.

261
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,646
Hold on.

262
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,529
Let me talk to him
real quick.

263
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,004
Zahir,
what is he saying?

264
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,050
He's wondering why we still
have our stuff here.

265
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,645
He's here to supervise us,

266
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,006
make sure we get on
the plane tomorrow.

267
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,401
Tell him not to worry,
that we are
wrapping things up...

268
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,005
that everything is on schedule.

269
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,400
Dad, what the hell?

270
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,001
Fine, fine.

271
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,920
How does
the air check out?

272
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,121
No. Don't even
think about it, Nora.

273
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,201
There's no way
you're going in there.

274
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,691
Actually,
according to the meters,

275
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,603
it's showing minimal traces
of toxic fumes...

276
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,240
but definitely
below dangerous levels.

277
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,487
But I'm assuming

278
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,400
it's because we're
still close to the entrance.

279
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,801
Can you enhance that?

280
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,086
Can you get out
of my workspace, please?

281
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,924
It's a $3 million rover.
Yeah, I can enhance it.

282
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,889
Okay, zoom in.
Zoom in right there.
Make that larger. Zoom in.

283
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,968
Dad, please.
What?

284
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,084
Ah! That.
This says "slaughter."

285
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,605
This says "God."

286
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,285
Yeah, this one
says "underworld."

287
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,766
What? Really?

288
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,004
Relax, Fitzie,
these are just symbols

289
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,082
to scare away
grave robbers.

290
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,965
Curved stick. Staff.

291
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,326
What the hell is that?

292
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,686
That, my dear,
is the symbol of Osiris.

293
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,370
Osiris?
He's the god
of the afterlife.

294
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,887
He's also considered by the
Egyptians <i>as</i> the first pharaoh.

295
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,569
Oh, God.

296
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,245
Okay, what was that?

297
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,405
It must've been a dog.

298
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,846
Got in somehow.

299
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,649
They left the opening
unguarded.

300
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,440
Let's just keep our
wits sharp, all right?

301
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,841
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

302
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,047
What?

303
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,445
You guys hear that?

304
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,202
I've lost
all external control.

305
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,283
Both the camera feeds.

306
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,363
Hold on, hold on.
Damn dogs.
You mean...

307
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,931
Hold on.

308
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,725
Shorty's offline.

309
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,760
- I got to go get him.
- No.

310
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,883
You are not going in there.
We have no idea what's in there.

311
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,246
Could be fumes still.

312
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,561
No. Be realistic, Zahir.

313
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Be realistic?

314
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,285
I just told you how much
that rover costs, okay?

315
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,050
It's on loan.
Does he not know
how this works?

316
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,407
- We can't even be here.
- We have to be on a plane.

317
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,846
And you don't think
NASA's gonna be pissed

318
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,729
to find out
we lost their rover?

319
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,401
Okay, okay.
But just the two of us.

320
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,360
Uh-uh. Uh, no.
That is not happening.

321
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,920
Okay, we have no idea if we're
gonna be able to come back here.

322
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,724
You're crazy if you think I'm
not going in there with you.

323
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,325
The camera goes
everywhere you do.

324
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,890
You agreed to that
back in the U.S.

325
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,920
Actually, I'm all
right to just hang back here.

326
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,286
You guys can go on...
Get your ass in there.

327
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,441
Okay.

328
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,567
Hope you brought
those extra batteries.

329
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,846
We're gonna need them.

330
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,769
Oh, I thought we were
the only ones filming.

331
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,365
It's my version
of a notebook.

332
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,600
I don't want
to miss anything.

333
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,641
You ready?
Uh...

334
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,603
Yeah, we're coming.
Let's go.

335
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,447
So, how are we supposed

336
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,601
to get Shorty out,
if it doesn't work?

337
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,921
I'll figure it out.

338
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,605
Yeah,
he doesn't know either.

339
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,524
So, I think these
flares might help us

340
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,960
take care of our
stray dog problem.

341
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,200
He's saying
we can't go in there.

342
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,646
Keep rolling!

343
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,771
Tell him
to calm down!

344
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,246
I'm trying.

345
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,047
Let me try
to talk to him.

346
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,440
What are they saying?

347
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,482
I can't get it,
they're going too fast.

348
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,484
He's making a plea
of some kind.

349
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,642
Uh, from one Egyptian
to another.

350
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,685
I think it's working.

351
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,401
All right, guys,
we've got two hours
to get Shorty.

352
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,371
Here you go.

353
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,371
What's that for?

354
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,440
It's just something
to help us find our way back.

355
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,240
You know, in case we decide
to go in a little further.

356
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,321
Further?

357
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,601
Great.

358
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,688
They don't seriously expect
us to wear these, do they?

359
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,524
Yeah, guess so.

360
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,090
Come on, guys,
let's go.

361
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,281
Watch your step.

362
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,361
The structure could
collapse at any moment.

363
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,601
And don't touch anything.

364
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,080
Stay close.

365
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,364
Imagine, the last people
who walked these tunnels...

366
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,046
died thousands of years ago.

367
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,371
Also,
the ancient Egyptians

368
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,760
only stood about
five feet tall...

369
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,484
so watch your heads.

370
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,489
It's a little
taller in here.

371
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,006
The dogs couldn't
have dragged him too far.

372
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,125
I don't get it.

373
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,965
There's no tracks.
He couldn't have just disappeared.

374
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,326
Guys...

375
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,330
which way do we go now?

376
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,168
No, no!

377
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,646
Michael, what's wrong?

378
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,569
Oh, God.

379
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,970
I'm dead. I'm dead.

380
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,646
Ooh.

381
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,324
NASA's gonna be pissed.

382
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,401
I'm dead.

383
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,961
I'm dead.

384
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,167
I'm freaking dead!

385
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,964
Death. Amazing.

386
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,849
Well, chin up, mate.

387
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,010
I'm sure we can find
the rest of him.

388
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,645
We're gonna find him.

389
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,207
Hey, Doc.

390
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,567
Is this the apex thing
you were talking about?

391
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,046
There's something
in the wall.

392
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,485
What's up there?

393
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,323
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

394
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,084
Nora, no.
Please don't fall.
Be careful.

395
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,208
Zahir, give me
your hand. Come on.

396
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,161
Okay, ready?

397
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,560
Yeah. One, two, three.

398
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,846
One, two, three.

399
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,604
All right,
I almost have the ledge.

400
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,921
Yeah. I got it. Okay.

401
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,526
All right.

402
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,526
You okay?

403
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,360
Oh. Guys, you got to
come check this out.

404
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,681
What do you see?

405
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,364
Just come up here.

406
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,045
I've never seen
anything like this before.

407
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,043
I thought this thing
was supposed to be a tomb.

408
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,361
It is.

409
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,250
What's with the arsenal?

410
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,561
It's ceremonial.

411
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,840
The ancient Egyptians
buried their pharaohs...

412
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,606
with an armory of spears,
for use in the afterlife.

413
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,444
Usually, they're placed

414
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,040
next to the sarcophagus,
never separately.

415
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,881
Dad?
Huh?

416
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,881
Look at that.

417
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,722
Mended at the shaft.
It's broken.

418
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,564
And I wonder...
Yeah, look at this.

419
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,882
There's a chip in this blade.

420
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,004
So these...
These were not
just ceremonial.

421
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,011
These saw battle.

422
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,280
Switch off your lights.

423
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,401
Lights Off.

424
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,401
- Whoa.
- Look at that.

425
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,561
What is that?

426
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,083
That is dried blood.

427
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,084
What does that mean?

428
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,527
I'll have to take it back

429
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,761
and analyze it
and date it.

430
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,160
We won't know until then,

431
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,611
so go ahead and take that
as a sample.

432
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,921
- Okay.
- Wow.

433
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,082
- Wow.
- That's cool.

434
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,645
- Hey, your wire.
- Huh?

435
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,370
- Your wire.
- What?

436
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,561
Oh.

437
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,444
It must have snapped.

438
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,406
It's high-tension
wire, Doctor,

439
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,970
it doesn't just snap.

440
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,240
- Well, how...
- Fitzie, you stepped on it.

441
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,327
No, I didn't.

442
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,891
You probably
didn't realize

443
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,200
but you must've done it
as you were filming.

444
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,482
Realize
I stepped on it?
You probably stepped on it!

445
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,971
It's all right.
It's all right.

446
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,280
Probably Zahir,
with his stupid robot.

447
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,646
It's all right,
just calm down.

448
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,881
We're not that far
from the entrance.

449
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,121
We'll set up
another wire.

450
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,801
All right.

451
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,964
Whoa.

452
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,642
- Okay?
- Okay, it's this way.

453
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,131
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

454
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,690
It's not this way,
it's that way.

455
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,251
Look, I copied down
the hieroglyphs

456
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,481
in my notebook
before we set off...

457
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,641
- as we entered.
- No.

458
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,040
No, I think we came
from this direction over here.

459
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,244
They all
look the same.

460
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,564
Uh, eeny, meeny,
miny, moe.

461
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,165
Oh, yeah.
That's enough, Fitzie.

462
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,482
Look, guys. It's this way.
It's this way.

463
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,280
See? This is why
we attach a wire.

464
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,561
That's strange.

465
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,489
These hieroglyphs
are all the same.

466
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,842
We only walked
for a few minutes.

467
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,843
Guys, is it just me
or is it becoming really,

468
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,729
really hard to breathe
in these masks?

469
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,400
Pyramids
are incredibly airtight.

470
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,010
Explains how
mummies can remain

471
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,889
so perfectly preserved
after all these years.

472
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,405
Yeah, no,
I'm not talking about

473
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,050
some pyramid
mumbo-jumbo here.

474
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,686
I'm being serious.
Something's off.

475
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,531
Now stay close.

476
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,286
I don't want to
lose anybody. Okay?

477
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,042
Shouldn't we go
back to where we were?

478
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,123
Yeah,
I think it was back...

479
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,805
No, it's impossible.

480
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,805
I was positive.

481
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,489
Mmm.
I'm sorry, honey.

482
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,051
We have to go back
in the other direction.

483
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,440
This looks...

484
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,611
Yeah, we definitely
came the wrong way.

485
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,810
What could this
chamber be?

486
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,644
Holy shit!

487
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,450
- What?
- Oh, no.

488
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,129
- There's Shorty.
- Oh, my God.

489
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,641
Oh, come on!

490
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,886
We should not be here.
Let's get out.

491
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,521
Oh, my God!

492
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,450
Wait, nobody move!
Nobody move.

493
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,406
All right.

494
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,201
All right.

495
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,800
Oh, my God.

496
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,605
What's happening?

497
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,489
The floor
is about to collapse.

498
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,961
What?

499
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,122
We have to back
out of here one at a time.

500
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,927
Fitzie? Come on.
You first.

501
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,526
Easy.

502
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,650
Move toward me, and try
not to step on the cracks.

503
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,201
That's good.

504
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,089
Come on.
That's good, Fitzie.

505
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,484
Don't jump! Just...

506
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,441
Okay, Okay-

507
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,045
Just come on,
come on, come on.

508
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,440
Good, good, good.

509
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,600
All right,
that's good, that's good.

510
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,842
That's right.
That's right.

511
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,205
- Oh, my God.
- That's right, that's right.

512
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,010
That's good.
That's good.

513
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,167
Come on.
That's good, Fitzie.

514
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,004
Okay, now, Zahir.
Come on. Come on.

515
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,730
Are you sure?
Come!

516
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,210
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

517
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,805
It's all right,
it's all right.

518
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,084
Come on,
Michael, faster!

519
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,321
Whoa!

520
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,163
Whoa!

521
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,203
Everybody run!

522
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,771
Nora? Nora?

523
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,809
I'm good. I'm good.

524
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,086
Is anyone hurt?

525
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,480
I'm alive.

526
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,603
Where are we?

527
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,250
Jeez,
I can't breathe

528
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,964
with this stupid mask.

529
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,727
Oh!

530
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,965
What is that smell?

531
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,248
Smells like shit.

532
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,131
Where are we?

533
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,651
I'm guessing
where the animal

534
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,405
who destroyed Shorty decided
to relieve itself.

535
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,450
That's a lot of shit
for just one dog

536
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,851
who got trapped.

537
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,169
Not only that,
where did it go?

538
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,566
How'd it get out?

539
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,770
The only way out is up.

540
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,084
Still, we've got
to get out of here soon.

541
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,125
I haven't smelt anything this
bad since Zahir's tent...

542
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,123
when he had the beans
the other day.

543
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,760
What the hell
is wrong with you, man?

544
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,243
Help me!

545
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,402
Nora, wait!
Michael, Michael!

546
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,800
Oh, my God!

547
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,963
- Oh, my God!
- Help me!

548
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,487
What do we do?

549
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,483
Okay, man, don't worry.
We're gonna get you out of here.

550
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,528
Okay, come on, guys!
Help me, please!

551
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,727
Michael, Michael.

552
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,967
Okay.

553
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,167
Calm down.

554
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,280
We need to push,
all right?

555
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,686
All right.
All right, push!

556
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,247
- One, two, three.
- My God.

557
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,329
Come on.
Push, push, push!

558
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,482
Stop! Stop!

559
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,082
Hey, hey, hey, hey-
Okay.

560
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,161
What are you
doing with the phone?

561
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,207
You're not gonna get
reception down here.

562
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,044
We're 90 feet below ground.

563
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,611
The walls are six feet thick.

564
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,091
Jesus, use your head.

565
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,611
We're never
gonna be able to get

566
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,600
this rock off of him
by ourselves.

567
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,560
And even if we do...

568
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,004
There's water
in there, get it out.

569
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,366
Hey, hey.
Listen to me.

570
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,567
Look at me. Look at me.

571
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,960
Look at me. Take these.

572
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,487
I want you to
swallow these, okay?
I want you to swallow.

573
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,246
Here you go.

574
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,971
He's gonna be
okay, Doctor?

575
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,804
He's not gonna die, is he?

576
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,961
Fitzie!

577
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,565
Just shut up, please!

578
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,651
You're not helping
right now, okay?

579
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,606
Michael, Michael. Breathe.

580
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,527
Hey, baby.
Look at me. Michael.

581
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,409
You are going to
get out of here, okay?

582
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,766
Just breathe, that's right.

583
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,801
Breathe.

584
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,168
Stay back,
something could still fall.

585
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,840
What are you
looking at?

586
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,531
This shaft should take us
back to where we came from.

587
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,845
You know, I think
I can get up there.

588
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,968
No, no,
that's not a good idea.

589
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,168
I've been rock climbing
my entire life.

590
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,850
If you give me a boost,
I can brace myself
in there and shimmy up.

591
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,923
Guys, she wants
to climb this shaft.

592
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,331
Can you tell her
she's crazy?

593
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,686
I can do it.

594
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,321
Don't worry.

595
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,604
Help me, come on!

596
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,046
Here, take this.

597
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,725
That way we can
watch on the monitor.

598
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,365
Jesus.

599
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,001
How's that? You're picking
that up? Yeah?

600
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,001
All right.

601
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,600
Okay. All right.

602
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,410
Okay, Sunni,
be careful.

603
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,085
Michael, calm down.

604
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,406
- Go slow!
- Yeah.

605
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,364
- Okay, be careful, Sunni.
- Go slow, go slow!

606
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,521
Yeah.

607
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,362
Right,
just take your time, okay?

608
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,246
You got it.

609
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,240
At the same time,
don't take too long.

610
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,801
Just let us know
if you see anything.

611
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,883
- Okay.
- Okay, Sunni?

612
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,081
Oh, God.

613
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,408
- You okay? Go slow, okay?
- Yeah.

614
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,640
What do you see?

615
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,686
I see two people

616
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,928
trying to break
my concentration!

617
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,281
Are you okay?

618
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,249
Did you guys
hear that?

619
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,526
I can't see anything.

620
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,091
It's too dark.

621
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,925
Hang in there, Zahir.

622
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,130
Let us know as soon <i>as</i> you
see anything, okay, Sunni?

623
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,283
I think something
is up here.

624
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,367
There's some kind of low
tunnel perpendicular to us.

625
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,565
Oh, my God!
Sunni, are you okay?

626
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,165
Yeah, I'm fine.
Oh, God.

627
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,526
You okay, Fitzie?

628
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,641
Okay.

629
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,920
- I think I've got shit in my ear.
- Dad, give me my bag.

630
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,286
Here, use this.

631
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,811
What happened up there?

632
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,970
I saw something.

633
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,168
I was almost there
and it popped out at me.

634
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,930
This is gonna
sting, okay?

635
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,927
So, was it a dog, yeah?

636
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,360
I didn't get
a good look.

637
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,801
But when I saw it,
I lost my...

638
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,206
I have another bag.

639
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,011
I saw its eyes.

640
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,449
What was it?

641
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,840
Yeah, hold on.

642
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,161
It was the same thing we saw

643
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,129
before we lost
contact with Shorty.

644
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,281
Sorry, sorry.

645
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,841
You know,
maybe it's the soldier.

646
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,889
He knows we're down here.
He's probably gonna be
looking for us.

647
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,566
A soldier popped out of a hidden
tunnel and scratched my face.

648
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,527
Maybe there's a way
out over there.

649
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,642
Hey, Michael.
Michael.

650
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,330
These carvings
tell a story.

651
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,847
You see these figures
holding the spears.

652
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,122
These are the same ones
we saw in the apex.

653
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,325
This is a warning.

654
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,201
A warning?

655
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,451
A warning for what?

656
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,726
I don't know.

657
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,884
I think we should
just stay here.

658
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,322
That soldier will come
looking for us eventually.

659
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,369
No, Michael might not
have that long.

660
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,721
We have to look
for another way out.

661
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,927
All right, then, fine.

662
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,206
What is your
plan now, Nora?

663
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,691
If there is
a gate here...

664
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,640
then behind those stones
there is a passage...

665
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,886
and maybe another way out.

666
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,560
And if the gate has been standing
here for thousands of years...

667
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,205
maybe it's standing here
for a reason.

668
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,361
Who are we to destroy it?

669
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,567
Jesus!

670
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,600
Stop being an archaeologist
for a minute here...

671
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,841
and start being
a human being!

672
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,331
Look, she's right,
okay?

673
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,164
We have to look
for help!

674
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,444
Maybe we can try the shaft.
Nora!

675
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,090
Look at her face!

676
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,930
We don't know
what's up there!

677
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,011
Look, guys, we can't
just sit around here.

678
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,123
Okay, we've got
things up there

679
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,964
scratching people's faces.

680
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,207
It stinks in here!

681
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,930
So put your mask
back on.

682
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,288
No, I'm serious, man.
Listen...

683
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,130
if we can survive this drop
then so can it.

684
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,566
Whatever it is.

685
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,931
And while we're
trapped in here

686
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,890
we're like food
in a bowl right now.

687
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,040
All right, fine.

688
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,160
There. You got it?
I got it.
Let's go over here.

689
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,600
Yeah, we're fine.

690
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,204
Okay, one more.
Ready? One, two...

691
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,726
Oh, God.

692
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,530
I don't know
if it's safe in there.

693
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,523
For all we know
that air could be...

694
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,644
Yeah, we'll take
our chances.

695
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,290
If you ask me, it's
not gonna be any worse...

696
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,880
than the air
we're breathing in here.

697
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,081
Yeah.

698
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,086
Hey.

699
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,364
You take it.
No. Mmm-mmm.

700
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,327
No. What, you want
to sit here in the dark?

701
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,960
No.

702
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,520
And besides,
if we get lost

703
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,489
then maybe we can
follow the light back.

704
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,441
Okay?

705
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,804
You're not gonna
need the hatchet,
but it's just in case.

706
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,487
I'm gonna go get
you help, okay?

707
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,529
I'm gonna
come back for you.

708
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,921
Hey, listen.

709
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,164
It's that soldier!
What's his name?
Shadid!

710
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,368
- Shadid!
- Shadid, help us!

711
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,846
- Hello!
- We're right over here!

712
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,087
Shadid!

713
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,163
Where's it coming from?

714
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,685
Uh, can't tell.

715
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,850
Did you guys
hear that?

716
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,086
Help me! Help me!

717
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,041
What's happening to him?

718
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,441
You guys, that's not Shadid.
That's Michael.

719
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,489
Michael!
You should go!
Go, go!

720
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,927
Find Shadid!
Nora, wait!

721
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,847
Shouldn't we
just go with them?

722
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,640
How are we supposed
to find Shadid?

723
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,165
Hello?

724
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,130
Shadid!

725
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,842
Are you still there?

726
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,485
Michael.

727
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,041
Oh, my God.

728
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,488
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

729
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,485
Oh, my God.

730
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,644
No, no, no-

731
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,322
No, this isn't happening.

732
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,046
No!

733
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,001
Okay.

734
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,360
No, this is
not possible.

735
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,280
I think we have
to get out of here.
No, no, no.

736
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,120
- It's not safe.
- No, where is he?

737
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,161
No, no...

738
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,684
No, it's not happening. No.

739
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,171
Nora.
I don't believe it.

740
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,691
Nora, Nora.
No, I...

741
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,684
Honey, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

742
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,683
I know you cared for him,
but we have to go.

743
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,763
Michael...
I'm so sorry.

744
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,725
I'm so sorry.

745
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,850
Honey, we have to go.
Michael!

746
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,400
We have to join
the others, okay?
I can't...

747
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,727
Okay, honey, you've got
to focus now.

748
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,524
We got to get out
of this pyramid.

749
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,682
It's not safe for us.
Come on.

750
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,723
Where did he go?

751
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,127
Come on.
Okay, come on.

752
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,800
Come on.
I can't.

753
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,200
Come on.

754
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,123
We should never
have followed them.

755
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,042
What's taking them
so long?

756
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,564
Should we go back there?

757
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,326
Shadid!

758
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,482
Shadid, can you hear us?

759
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,766
All right.

760
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,526
What happened
to Zahir?

761
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,409
Zahir is dead.

762
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,084
He tried to
shift the boulder.

763
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,969
It rolled over
and crushed him.

764
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,406
That's impossible.
We couldn't shift

765
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,800
that thing
between the four of us!

766
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,370
I don't know.
I think he was

767
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,880
chipping away at it
with the hatchet.

768
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,365
Oh, that's
a load of bull.

769
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,729
We heard the screams.

770
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,965
If there's anything
we've learned today

771
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,405
it's that you're talking
out of your ass.

772
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,090
No,
she's right, yeah.

773
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,171
You're lying to us.

774
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,766
What about the eyes I saw
at the top of the tunnel?

775
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,527
Whatever took a chunk
out of my face killed Zahir!

776
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,126
Calm down, lady. Oh,
don't tell me to calm down!

777
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,801
I'm sorry...

778
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,849
but robot guy
has just been devoured...

779
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,606
by a creature we cannot
identify, for Christ's sake!

780
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,761
"Calm down."

781
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,000
Who the hell
do you think...

782
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,041
Nobody made you come!

783
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,282
My job is to follow
you guys with the camera.

784
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,566
What, are you just
following orders now?

785
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,563
Step up and take
responsibility

786
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,051
for your own actions!

787
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,806
Hey! Back off!

788
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,450
Keep her away from me!
Back off!

789
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,125
Jesus, Sunni, relax.

790
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,884
Don't tell me to relax!

791
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,646
This asshole has led us
into a death trap!

792
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,880
I don't need
this right now.

793
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,246
Look, Sunni,
all right?

794
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,289
You're panicking
and you're freaking out!

795
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,845
You're just looking for
someone to blame right now.

796
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,921
Oh, I found him.

797
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,369
Well, that attitude

798
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,204
is not going to help us out
right now, is it?

799
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,445
All right, just relax.

800
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,004
Come on,
just breathe.

801
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,280
I'm sure we can find
a way out of here.

802
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,251
What we need to do
is to find Shadid.

803
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,687
He got in here,
we can get out.

804
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,080
Yeah.
How's that?

805
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,480
Yeah, great.

806
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,686
What's up?

807
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,285
No, it was nothing.

808
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,171
Come on, Fitzie,
you go first.

809
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,367
What?

810
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,124
Me?
Yes.

811
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,323
What am I,
a bloody guinea pig?

812
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,011
Oh, for God's sake.

813
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,491
Are you seeing
how tight this is?

814
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,563
Just go.

815
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,890
Bloody hell.

816
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,929
Are you sure
this is the way?

817
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,287
Can't be sure
of anything in this place.

818
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,001
So...

819
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,006
remind me again, guys,

820
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,286
what do I do if this
thing jumps out at me...

821
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,766
and scratches my face off?

822
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,571
You try to put as much distance
<i>as</i> you can between you and it.

823
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,007
Right, this is probably about
<i>as</i> fast <i>as</i> I can move right now.

824
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,810
Just move faster, Fitzie!

825
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,840
I don't want to be here
long enough to find out!

826
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,121
Guys.

827
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,650
- Guys?
- Yeah.

828
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,131
Something's behind us!

829
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,009
What do we do?
What do we do?

830
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,208
- Keep going!
- Just move! Move!

831
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,241
Just move, Fitzie! Move!

832
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,210
Go! Go! Go!
Go <i>as</i> fast
<i>as</i> you can, Fitzie!

833
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,323
It's coming faster!

834
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,401
Shit.

835
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,289
- Oh, God!
- Don't stop.

836
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,962
Oh, God. Oh, my God!
There's something here.

837
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,481
Shit!

838
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,244
Keep going.
Keep going.

839
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,489
It's coming faster!

840
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,723
Oh, guys, the soldier's here!

841
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,847
It's Shadid.

842
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,650
Where the hell
did he come from?

843
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,131
Hurry up, Fitzie!

844
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,089
Keep moving. Keep moving.

845
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,045
Come on. Come on.

846
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,481
Get back.

847
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,210
Everybody, get back!
Get back!

848
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,806
Jesus.

849
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,444
What the hell was that?

850
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,086
Oh, my God.

851
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,885
Holy shit!

852
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,849
Lights! Fitzie!
Come on.

853
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,444
Turn it off.
Kill the light!

854
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,640
- We should...
- No, no, no.

855
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,523
Just don't move a muscle.

856
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,765
Fitzie, shut up.

857
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,440
We should be very quiet.

858
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,409
What the fuck
was that?

859
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,045
I have no idea.

860
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,608
Did you see
the claws on that thing?

861
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,247
What the hell
is going on down here?

862
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,887
All right.

863
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,250
Don't go too close.

864
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,811
Is it gone?

865
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,603
Whoa, Sunni, that scratch
is becoming really infected.

866
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,720
Your eye is not looking
too good, either.

867
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,928
We need to find
an exit right now.

868
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,769
Please tell me there is
something on this wall...

869
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,201
that explains how
to get out of here...

870
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,011
or at least what the
bloody hell is after us.

871
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,607
This panel depicts
the final judgment,
the weighing of souls.

872
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,961
What?

873
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,122
It's from the
Egyptian Book of the Dead.

874
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,160
When a person died,
they passed into a room.

875
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,807
They were brought before
Osiris and a panel of judges.

876
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,201
And next to them
was a massive scale.

877
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,050
Then the god Anubis
weighed their heart

878
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,203
against Maat,
the goddess of truth.

879
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,243
And if it balanced
perfectly,

880
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,209
they passed
into the afterlife.

881
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,405
They believed
they were sent to the sky

882
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,720
to dwell among the stars.

883
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,040
I thought
the Book of the Dead

884
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,680
was just full of spells
and incantations.

885
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,404
No,
it's more than that.

886
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,486
It's a guide
to immortality.

887
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,041
This was central
to Egyptian philosophy.

888
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,602
This is the final milestone.

889
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,167
What, and you believe
in this rubbish, do you?

890
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,131
They believed it.

891
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,920
I think the priests
acted out this ritual.

892
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,968
None of this matters
unless we get out of here.

893
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,327
We've got to go.
Let's go! Let's go.

894
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,886
What do you see?

895
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,285
It's a dead end.

896
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,001
Fuck!

897
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,851
What was that?

898
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,002
I thought you said
don't touch anything.

899
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,041
What now?

900
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,041
What...

901
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,407
We'll get buried
if we don't go!

902
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,561
Come on!

903
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,445
Go, go, go!

904
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,761
Come on!

905
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,203
- Nora!
- I'm trying!

906
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,281
Nora.

907
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,246
Nora, come on!

908
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,767
- Come on!
- Dad, I can't move!

909
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,561
I'm stuck!

910
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,601
Guys!

911
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,121
Dad!

912
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,601
Dad!

913
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,447
Help!

914
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,770
Whoa!

915
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,126
Guys, I'm stuck! Help!

916
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,481
All right. Give us...

917
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,801
Sunni!

918
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,481
Oh, God!

919
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,523
Oh, my God! Sunni!

920
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,048
Come on.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

921
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,601
Give me your hand. Come on!
Just pull! Wiggle your legs!

922
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,330
God!
I'm gonna help you!

923
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,970
I'm gonna get you!

924
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,167
Guys!

925
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,887
Shit!

926
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,161
No!

927
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,168
No, no, no, no! Don't!

928
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,481
Sunni!

929
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,446
Guys!

930
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,165
Oh, God! No!
Help! We need your help!

931
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,685
Oh, God.

932
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,245
Get away!
Please... Sunni...

933
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,840
Get away!

934
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,126
Help!

935
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,967
Dad!
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand!

936
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,321
Help me.
Just don't...

937
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,847
Keep at it!
Dad!

938
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,286
You're doing great.
Come on. Give me...
Dad!

939
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,487
Wiggle your legs!

940
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,166
Come on, honey!
You have to keep squirming!

941
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,526
Nora!

942
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,526
Sunni!

943
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,168
I'm gonna get you! Guys!

944
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,724
Right there.
Right there.

945
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,290
Come on. Come on.

946
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,126
Come on,
and give me your hand!

947
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,650
Come on! Come on, Nora!

948
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,529
Hold on! Nora!

949
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,810
Got it! God...

950
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,041
Come on. I got your hand.

951
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,486
I got you, I got you.

952
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,887
Aah!

953
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,404
Pull!
I am...

954
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,401
Nora...

955
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,162
Thank God. Thank God.

956
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,524
Oh, God!

957
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,250
Fitzie!
Doctor!

958
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,169
Jesus. Oh, my God.

959
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,241
Okay!

960
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,009
Come here, guys.
Fitzie, get on the corner.

961
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,208
Take the rope.
I'm gonna throw it to you.
All right?

962
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,448
- Get the end. You got it?
- Yes!

963
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,840
Great.
Sunni, just hold on,

964
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,081
we're coming
right down, all right?

965
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,441
Watch out!

966
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,881
Wait.

967
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,885
Be careful.

968
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,444
Grip tight.
Grip tight. Grip tight.

969
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,443
That's right.
You're doing great.

970
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,210
Oh, Jesus. She's...

971
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,930
Here, here.

972
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,601
Okay-

973
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,967
Lift up...

974
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,805
Right there, okay.
Is that better?

975
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,963
Is that better? Okay.

976
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,600
Just try not to
breathe so hard,
all right?

977
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,047
Long breaths, yeah.

978
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,121
Ow!

979
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,447
Nora. Come on,
change places with me.

980
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,931
Cradle her head.

981
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,809
Okay. Okay.
Just take her head.

982
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,366
Aah!

983
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,721
Oh, God.

984
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,166
We're gonna get you
out of here, okay?

985
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,600
- Right, guys?
- Let's do it.

986
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,404
All right,
we're gonna get you off, Sunni.

987
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,085
Okay, you got her legs?
Yeah, yeah.

988
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,651
I got her shoulders.
Okay.

989
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,921
Pull straight up,
all right?

990
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,809
On the count of three.
One...

991
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,321
two...

992
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,165
three.

993
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,966
Pull.

994
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,167
Come on!

995
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,128
Stop! Stop, stop!

996
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,806
Okay, okay, okay.
It's not working.

997
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,689
If we lift her off,
she's gonna bleed out.

998
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,569
Okay, okay.

999
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,801
HOLDEN; Shit!

1000
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,480
- Okay, let's try again.
- No.

1001
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,568
No! She can't take it.

1002
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,245
Just give her a second,
all right.

1003
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,561
Oh, God.

1004
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,641
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1005
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,080
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus. Jesus.

1006
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,406
Hold her.
Hold her, hold her.
Oh, my God!

1007
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,040
Sunni! I'm trying!
Hold her! Hold her!

1008
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,406
I'm trying!
Hold her! Hold her still!

1009
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,561
I can't, I can't!
She can't twist!

1010
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,245
Hold her!
I can't!

1011
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,851
She's gone into...

1012
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,281
Okay.

1013
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:50,961
Oh, God.

1014
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,447
Sunni?

1015
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,721
Oh, God.

1016
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,561
Oh, my God.

1017
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,651
Oh, my God.

1018
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,840
I think I can
get her leg off.

1019
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,684
I think if I just
get her leg off,

1020
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,444
then we can get her
out of here.

1021
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,886
Fitzie, that's it.
Oh, my God.

1022
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,121
No. No, no, no.

1023
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,364
We need to get her off.

1024
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,131
Oh, my God.

1025
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,200
Those creatures
can come back at any minute.

1026
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,805
We have to go now.

1027
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,886
Dad?

1028
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,326
Your neck.

1029
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,085
Oh, shit, is that...

1030
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,808
Like the digger!
Probably.

1031
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,371
- Just...
- What?

1032
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,966
But why has it
appeared now?

1033
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,003
The masks
stopped the onset.

1034
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,090
For some reason,
the progress has been slowed.

1035
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,320
Why didn't you
say anything?

1036
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,606
What difference
does it make?

1037
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,127
If I'm infected, we all will be.
It doesn't...

1038
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,566
Sorry.

1039
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,050
Okay, we got to get
out of here right now.

1040
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,123
Well, that's
our only choice.

1041
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,327
You okay, Fitzie?

1042
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,970
Yeah.
All right.

1043
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,251
Those things...
I think they're Sphynx cats.

1044
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,851
Like the statue?

1045
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,923
The ancient Egyptians
believed that cats,
like Bastet...

1046
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,764
were the guardians
of the underworld.

1047
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,365
They could have
been placed here

1048
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,960
to protect whomever
was buried in here.

1049
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,491
All right, this way.

1050
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,165
How have they
survived all this time

1051
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,004
without any food or water?

1052
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,645
I think
they ate each other.

1053
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,768
Each generation
feeding the next.

1054
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,809
Like, uh, rats.

1055
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,290
Great,
so to survive down here,

1056
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,725
you have to resort
to cannibalism.

1057
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,048
That would explain
the air toxicity.

1058
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,802
Okay, I see
an opening overhead.

1059
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,809
Fitzie,
bring your camera here,
I need the light.

1060
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,926
How can we
possibly be back here?

1061
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,085
It's a labyrinth.

1062
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,845
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's just think
this through logically.

1063
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,767
All right,
we can't go that way,
that's a sand trap.

1064
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,729
And we know that
that's a dead end.

1065
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,685
But Corporal Shadid
got in here somehow,

1066
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,524
so there has to be
a way out.

1067
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,760
How can we...

1068
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,041
Look.

1069
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,046
Shorty.

1070
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,728
You know, this antenna
might still be

1071
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,087
broadcasting a signal
to the outside.

1072
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,320
Well, what are you thinking?

1073
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,811
Hold on one second.

1074
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,366
I can rewire
my camera to it

1075
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,169
and we can record
a message...

1076
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,561
and send it to one of
the outside monitors.

1077
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,330
Well, will that work?

1078
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,448
It's worth a shot.
I mean...

1079
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,921
I can't guarantee
anyone's gonna see it,

1080
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,604
but, it'd improve our odds.

1081
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,246
What's that?

1082
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,686
Ah.

1083
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,366
- Look. Ah.
- Brilliant.

1084
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,524
Okay, so, uh,
be quick, Doctor.

1085
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,326
I'm not sure how long this
aerial battery's gonna last

1086
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,849
And also, you know,
the cat creatures.

1087
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,363
Hopefully someone
will bother to play back

1088
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,965
these tapes
when they find our gear.

1089
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,725
If they find it.

1090
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,850
My name is Dr. Miles Holden.

1091
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,765
And I was a professor
at Princeton University.

1092
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:02,603
I am trapped in the excavation
site with my daughter...

1093
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,401
Dr. Nora Holden,
and cameraman
Terry Fitzsimmons.

1094
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,085
And we need help.

1095
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,761
Two of our team members,
engineer Michael Zahir...

1096
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,050
and documentary filmmaker
Sunni Marshe, are dead.

1097
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,929
This pyramid, unlike any other
structure I've ever encountered...

1098
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,844
seems to have been built
with the express purpose...

1099
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,526
of keeping whatever
is inside from escaping.

1100
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:29,086
If you come down here,
bring guns.

1101
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,040
Is that good?

1102
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,521
Yeah, it was good.
It was really good.

1103
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,406
Did you feel that?

1104
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,121
Yeah.

1105
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,771
Huh?

1106
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,921
Oh, wow.

1107
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,003
It's like a vacuum
pulling the air out.

1108
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,730
What is it?

1109
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,203
I think something's
back there.

1110
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,847
I think it's a way out.

1111
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,411
How do you know that?

1112
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,331
I don't.

1113
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,081
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Careful, Doc.

1114
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,686
Remember the last time
you started touching things.

1115
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,571
Whoa!

1116
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,081
How did you
find that?

1117
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,800
I didn't spend my entire life
behind a desk, you know.

1118
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,170
Creepy stuff.

1119
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,931
Do you think
Shadid came this way?

1120
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,047
I do.

1121
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,600
This doesn't
look like the Egypt stuff

1122
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,449
you find at
the British Museum,
eh, guys?

1123
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,045
This possibly
could be a link

1124
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,889
to an older civilization.

1125
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,966
So, um...

1126
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,603
how are you feeling, Doc?

1127
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,689
I want to
get out of here.

1128
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,127
Oh, yeah.

1129
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,961
What?

1130
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,885
Do you, um...

1131
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,607
I mean, do you feel
any sicker or...

1132
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,091
You know what?
I really haven't

1133
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,600
had that much time
to think about it.

1134
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,406
Mmm.

1135
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,006
Oh, man.

1136
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:41,166
Whoa.

1137
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,446
So...

1138
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,607
Ugh.

1139
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,530
From the shitty room

1140
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,840
to the kitty tomb...

1141
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,924
that, you know,
also smells like shit.

1142
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,531
You think this was built

1143
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,125
to be some sort of prison,
then, Doc?

1144
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,521
Oh, well, many temples
in the ancient world...

1145
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,251
were thought to be the earthly
dwelling places of the gods.

1146
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,689
Some were benign
and giving.

1147
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,241
Others, like the gods
the Aztecs worshipped,

1148
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,084
were violent.

1149
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,361
They were imprisoned...

1150
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,851
and then they were
fed a steady diet

1151
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,809
of human sacrifice
to appease them.

1152
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,962
Thousands were sacrificed.

1153
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,446
As their hearts
were cut out...

1154
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,480
their bodies were kicked down
the pyramid steps.

1155
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,685
So, what's your point?

1156
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,090
Whatever
we're dealing with,

1157
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,049
it's not benign
and giving.

1158
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,609
Let's go deeper
into this hellhole.

1159
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,843
Make it completely impossible for
them to discover our bodies.

1160
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,565
Oh, shit.

1161
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,681
I think we found
the bottom of the pyramid.

1162
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:11,681
Well...

1163
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,960
now we just
have to find...

1164
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,169
the right escape shaft.

1165
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,201
- Dad?
- Huh?

1166
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,245
Dad?
What?

1167
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,645
Jesus.

1168
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,763
Well, well, well, well.

1169
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,928
We were not
the first ones here.

1170
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,200
What happened
to him?

1171
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,766
Shit.
Shit, look at that.

1172
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,490
Hey, hey.
What?

1173
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,284
- That's a Freemason symbol.
- Huh.

1174
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,367
They must've built the offshoot
tunnel that we entered.

1175
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,565
Yeah, it makes sense.

1176
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:07,047
All right,
yeah, this is all
very interesting...

1177
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:10,689
but our main priority should
be getting out of here.

1178
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:12,810
The Masons
aren't important.

1179
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,326
They were
excellent tomb robbers.

1180
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,084
If they couldn't
find a way out...

1181
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,971
Shit.

1182
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,401
What?

1183
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,369
I can't read this.
What is that?

1184
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,530
Here, give it to me.

1185
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:30,243
Guys, can we drop the history
crap for five minutes, please...

1186
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,401
and get out of here?

1187
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,766
Just read it!

1188
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:34,925
It's a journal.

1189
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,285
Fitzie, I need your light.

1190
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,326
"May 21st, 1897.

1191
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,050
"The path we took
upon our entry

1192
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,884
"into the pyramid
has been blocked.

1193
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,922
"We may have located

1194
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,765
"a means of escape
in the burial chamber."

1195
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,650
That's the last entry.

1196
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,921
And this looks like
the burial chamber to me.

1197
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,006
All right. Well, then...

1198
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,243
there might be
a means of escape!

1199
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,800
You're right.

1200
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,760
We have to keep going.
We don't want to end up...

1201
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,686
- Dad! Dad!
- Nora! Run!

1202
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,242
Nora! Let's go!

1203
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,402
No! I have to go
back for him!

1204
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,210
No, we can't!
I have to go back!

1205
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,044
I'm sorry,
we've got to go!

1206
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,810
Keep going!

1207
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,485
Oh, my God!

1208
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,882
What? No!

1209
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,208
No! No!

1210
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,571
Oh, my God.

1211
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,721
I can't...

1212
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,125
He's gone.

1213
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,685
He's gone.

1214
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,923
There must be
some sort of latch...

1215
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,642
or mechanism
that your dad found.

1216
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,850
I don't know.

1217
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,401
I don't...

1218
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,646
You know what?

1219
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,805
Screw it.

1220
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,364
I'd rather face him
once and for all

1221
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,965
than spend the rest
of my life running.

1222
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,849
Are you out of your mind?

1223
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,605
Nora, come on.

1224
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,923
Look at all this shit
we've been through!

1225
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,888
Someone will find
our tapes.

1226
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,525
The least I can do
is let people know

1227
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:50,726
who killed me.

1228
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:53,451
What is wrong with you?

1229
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:57,207
My dad just died and all you
care about is getting your shot.

1230
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,922
It's not about
the shot, Nora.

1231
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,442
I just don't know
what else to do.

1232
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,444
Fitzie,
please don't leave me.

1233
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,124
Fitzie, please...

1234
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,931
Fitzie...

1235
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,685
Oh, God.

1236
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,001
Help!

1237
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,924
Oh, he's still alive.

1238
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:45,281
Help... Help, help...

1239
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,481
No...

1240
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,886
Nora.

1241
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,605
It's me.

1242
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,325
This isn't real.

1243
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,204
No, this can't be happening.

1244
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,484
It's impossible.

1245
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:08,762
It's Anubis,
or the Devourer.

1246
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,731
He took my father's heart
to weigh his soul.

1247
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,604
What are you
talking about?

1248
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:22,286
Anubis, half man,
half jackal.

1249
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,484
He ate the hearts of those
he found to be impure.

1250
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,086
In the Book of the Dead...

1251
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,322
the Last Judgment
is the final gate

1252
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,244
before resurrection
or damnation.

1253
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,851
If there's a way out,
it's inside that room.

1254
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,245
We don't have a choice.

1255
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,565
We can either stay here
and die, or we...

1256
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,324
Or we can die trying.

1257
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,323
Oh, God,
it's the soldier.

1258
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,011
Come on, Nora.

1259
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:48,647
I'm so sorry, Dad.

1260
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,721
Come on, Nora.
Grab his flare.

1261
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,606
Wait.

1262
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,208
It tells the story of Osiris.

1263
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,924
Osiris. No, no, no.

1264
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:44,366
You said Anubis.

1265
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,846
Osiris was his father...

1266
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,526
or his creator.

1267
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,967
It's the same symbol
for both words.

1268
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,602
Egyptians believe Osiris
came from the heavens...

1269
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,886
and brought agriculture
and tool-making...

1270
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,960
I get that you find
this stuff fascinating, okay?

1271
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,963
But right now
what we should be

1272
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,082
working on is
how to get out of here.

1273
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,129
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

1274
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,850
Osiris knew that his time
had come on Earth...

1275
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,280
so he had
this pyramid built

1276
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,720
for his journey
into the afterlife.

1277
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,166
Nora, I promise you,
look...

1278
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,288
I've got it all
down on tape. All right?

1279
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,647
You can watch it back
as soon as we're out.

1280
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,608
Anubis turned his wrath
on the people.

1281
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,007
He had hundreds
of them sacrificed...

1282
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,049
so he could join his father
in the afterlife.

1283
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,011
Since his soul
was corrupted,

1284
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,730
he was looking
for a pure one...

1285
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:27,928
a pure heart, if you will.

1286
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,082
The only way to enter
the final gate of heaven.

1287
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,084
My father was right.

1288
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,328
This pyramid
became a prison.

1289
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,440
Closed by the Egyptians
to get rid of their own god.

1290
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,285
Nora, does this thing
give us any clues

1291
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,850
on how to get out of here?

1292
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,485
It says something
about a star map.

1293
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:46,880
Then you got
to find it, okay?

1294
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:50,243
Because your friend Anubis is
gonna be back any minute now!

1295
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,489
The exit shaft
points to where the dead

1296
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,369
was supposed to be
resurrected.

1297
01:14:58,280 --> 01:14:59,361
Well, then...

1298
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,847
There must be at least
six shafts in this room.

1299
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,480
How do we know
which is the right one?

1300
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,161
The stars...

1301
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,490
Look at the ceiling.

1302
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,410
Fitzie,
turn off your light.

1303
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,325
Look at the ceiling.

1304
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,608
In between the hieroglyphs,
all those dots.

1305
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,569
That's the star map!

1306
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,688
So what exactly
are we looking for?

1307
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,490
The tetrahedron.

1308
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,130
The three-sided
pyramid is also

1309
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,362
the hieroglyphic symbol
for the Sirius star.

1310
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,648
Look! There it is.

1311
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,490
The brightest one.

1312
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,810
It's right above
this shaft.

1313
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,200
It's got to be our way out!

1314
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,840
Okay. Well, let's go
check it out.

1315
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,169
Okay. Come on!

1316
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,530
It's got to be the one.

1317
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,610
Look! The rope.

1318
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,360
That's got to be
how the soldier entered.

1319
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,848
Ah. Thank you,
Captain Egypt.

1320
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,248
You think that thing
will hold us both?

1321
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,724
I guess we have to see.

1322
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,048
Okay-

1323
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,565
All right, you go first.

1324
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,211
Here, take this.

1325
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:11,121
Just in case.

1326
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,281
I'll be right behind you.

1327
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,885
Okay, hold that.

1328
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,680
Okay-

1329
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,725
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.

1330
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,851
Try and get
your leg up on that ledge.

1331
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,883
Can't be much further now.

1332
01:16:58,680 --> 01:16:59,681
Shit! He's back!

1333
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,211
Go, Nora! Go!

1334
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:04,204
Don't look back!
Fitzie, keep going!
Don't look down!

1335
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:06,521
Shit, he's back!

1336
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,370
Go, Nora! Go! Go! Go!

1337
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:09,800
Come on, Fitzie, move!

1338
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,405
I'm coming!
Move! Move!

1339
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,726
Go on!

1340
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:14,727
Come on, Fitzie!

1341
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,640
You can keep going!
Come on! Don't look down!

1342
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,081
Climb!

1343
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,289
Fitzie!

1344
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,881
Help! Help!

1345
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,325
No!

1346
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:23,847
Aah!

1347
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:25,961
Fitzie.

1348
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:28,686
No!

1349
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:53,486
Ah...

1350
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:13,400
Yeah...

1351
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,971
Help me.

1352
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,564
Help me.

1353
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43,884
Help, please...

1354
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:46,648
Please help me.

1355
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:09,046
<i>The only thing</i>

1356
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,961
<i>My silhouette</i>

1357
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:18,409
<i>I meet my fate
with every breath</i>

1358
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,365
<i>My heart escapes</i>

1359
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:24,644
<i>Rising through a hole
in the ceiling</i>

1360
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,564
<i>Disintegrate</i>

1361
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,407
<i>The body that I'm holding</i>

1362
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:35,122
<i>I will sacrifice
more than a thousand lives</i>

1363
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,124
<i>My soul won't be crucified</i>

1364
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,483
<i>I'll come back
with light shining</i>

1365
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:44,610
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

1366
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:50,166
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

1367
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:54,131
<i>Get back what
you took from me</i>

1368
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:57,410
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

1369
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:58,970
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

1370
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:05,921

<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

1372
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:21,603
<i>Prepare my grave</i>

1373
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:24,690
<i>For what I know,
it's waiting</i>

1374
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:27,081
<i>I welcome in</i>

1375
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,724
<i>All that I am fearing</i>

1376
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,770
<i>There's no way out</i>

1377
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,684
<i>Now I must shed my skin</i>

1378
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:42,086
<i>The only way through
the flame of fire within</i>

1379
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,641
<i>I will sacrifice</i>

<i>Get back what
you took from me</i>

1383
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,970
Me...

1384
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:09,445
<i>In the dark there is light</i>

1385
