2
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,390
Cup of coffee?

3
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,270
Thank you.

4
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,070
- From around here?
- Long time ago.

5
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,750
Things sure as hell
have changed, huh?

6
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,190
Well, things change.

7
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,510
Hey, why don't I just put a little taste
of whiskey in that coffee?

8
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,510
What do you say?

9
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,150
- That's nice.
- You just sit down over there.

10
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,910
Relax. You make yourself at home.
I'll bring you the coffee.

11
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,830
Thank you.

12
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,070
What can I do for you fellas?

13
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,030
You wanna do somethin' for me?

14
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,030
- You can open the cash register.
- All right.

15
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,950
- Y-You just take it easy.
- You should leave.

16
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,750
I heard an echo.

17
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,670
Did you hear an echo?

18
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,910
Now.

19
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,230
What the hell
you gonna do, old man?

20
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,030
Drool on me?

21
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,550
Mother-

22
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,270
Where did you learn
to fight like that?

23
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,110
It was long ago.

24
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,870
- What the hell is this?
- You read, please.

25
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,630
I'm invited?

26
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,150
- Hey, Georgie!
- Yeah.

27
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,390
Get a load of this.

28
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,870
You know what to do.

29
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,230
Let's go, guys!
Let's go!

30
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,590
Hey, clown boy.

31
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,670
- Get off of my street.
- Wait a minute.

32
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,750
Hey, Dubois.

33
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,830
What are you,
sick in the head or somethin'?

34
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:07,150
Please. Grow up, go get yourself some
decent clothes and come work for me.

35
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,790
- I don't work for nobody.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.

36
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,630
It's too bad, Dubois.
It's too bad.

37
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,150
You're a waste-of-talent nutcase,
you know that?

38
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,270
Suit yourself.
I got money to make.

39
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,630
Move.

40
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,470
Hey, here.

41
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,430
Please. Juggle.

42
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,950
Dubois, I want you and your kids
off the street.

43
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,910
I mean it, Dubois.
This is it.

44
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,350
Move it, kid.

45
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,350
Get down now
or we'll knock you flat.

46
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,870
Grab him!

47
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,910
- Some nut, huh?
- Hmph. Yeah.

48
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,030
Get your ass down here.

49
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,150
Dubois, get down.

50
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,390
You've crossed the line, Dubois.

51
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,670
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Lookin' for a toilet.

52
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,830
There's no toilet there.
Get lost. Get lost.

53
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,990
Where'd he go?

54
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,870
- Did you get it?
- There was nothing there.

55
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,510
It's impossible.
Today's the day.

56
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,870
Nothin', Chief. Sorry.

57
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,990
Nothing? Nothing.

58
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,710
I don't believe it.

59
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,790
- Wow!
- Did I tell you or what? We're rich!

60
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,390
Yeah!

61
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,510
- Look at that!
- With this we buy respect.

62
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,270
If we want something,
we take it.

63
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,350
- Forever and ever.
- Forever and ever!

64
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,470
- Billy.
- Yes, Chief?

65
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,390
Get us some food-
some real food.

66
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,310
Go.

67
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,310
- Let's celebrate.
- Yeah!

68
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,870
- Good night.
- Good night.

69
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,950
I'm so full I could bust.

70
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,710
Red, you go to bed.
See you in the morning, kids.

71
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,230
Dubois!

72
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,270
Hand me the dough, clown,
or the kid's dead.

73
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,430
Easy, easy.
The kid had nothing to do with it.

74
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,110
Shut your mouth
and hand me the bag!

75
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,190
You heard him, Dubois.
Hand it over.

76
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,070
Count it.

77
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,070
Nobody steals from me.
Nobody.

78
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,790
Billy. Oh, Billy.

79
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,510
It's okay. It's okay.
He's gonna be fine.

80
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,550
The cops are gonna blame you, Chris.

81
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,870
Chris. Chris!

82
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,230
They're gonna kill you!
Get outta here! Go!

83
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,790
Red, you're in charge now.
No matter what happens, I'll come back.

84
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,470
I swear to God.
I'll come back.

85
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,590
This way! Down here!

86
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,670
Put 'em in the wagon.

87
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,590
All right, come with me.

88
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,230
Dubois! I'm gonna find you
and I'm gonna kill you!

89
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,670
Dubois! Dubois!

90
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,510
Check the exits and watch the docks!
He's here somewhere!

91
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,830
Move it!
I got the gutter! Dubois!

92
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,790
Check the cargo.
Look around those boxes.

93
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,790
- What was that?
- By the warehouse! Move out!

94
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,870
Under there.

95
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,230
Your mother's health isn't improving,
and her money's gone.

96
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,190
I rather doubt she'll be coming.

97
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,270
Now, Christopher, be a good boy
and stay right here.

98
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,230
I'll be back.

99
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,190
Don't move. Don't move!

100
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,550
What is this?

101
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,590
A stowaway.
You work for us.

102
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,790
- Put him in chains.
- Wait.

103
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,350
Come on.

104
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,830
Back to work.

105
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,790
I come to say good-bye.

106
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,470
It's a shame,
but even good things...

107
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,230
come to an end.

108
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,550
Yes. I'm sure...

109
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,310
the sharks will enjoy you.

110
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,430
Hit the boiler room.

111
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,630
- Grappling irons, now!
- Cast!

112
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,110
Fire at will!

113
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,790
Come on, boys.
The Turk's ours.

114
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,510
Harry, who the hell is that?

115
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,590
We're even.

116
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,430
Hey, you're losin'
your aim, Dobbsy.

117
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,350
What's your name, son?

118
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:19,070
Christopher Dubois.

119
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,430
Mine's Dobbs. Lord Dobbs.

120
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,630
And how can we be of service,
Christopher Dubois?

121
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,830
I need to find a ship
back to America.

122
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,390
America, eh?
Well, you're in luck.

123
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,470
We might just find one
on Muay Thai Island.

124
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,990
- Muay Thai Island? No-
- Trust me.

125
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,750
Yes, sir. You are now the guest
of Admiral Dobbs and Harry Smith.

126
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,670
The last of the buccaneers.
Come aboard.

127
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,030
Thanks.

128
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,190
Piece of shit.

129
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,790
Muay Thai Island off the bow!

130
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,950
Muay Thai Island, Chris...

131
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,630
where my good friend
Mr. Khao will take care of you.

132
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,070
Hurry it up, lads.

133
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,430
Quickly as you can
with those boxes, boys.

134
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,990
I want to get this tide
out of here.

135
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,430
Khao, my old friend.
Nice to see you.

136
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,470
How are you?
How's business?

137
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,750
Oh, that good, eh?
Well, I have a few interesting items...

138
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,710
I picked up on the way here.

139
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,430
Perfect for insurrections.

140
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,590
But I have something
even better. Harry.

141
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:44,110
- Bring Chris over here.
- Come on.

142
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,110
Watch the way the boy moves.

143
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:49,510
Chris Dubois from the United States,
the best fighter I've ever seen.

144
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,790
Oh, Chris. Khao was saying
he's going to make sure...

145
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,110
you catch the boat that comes here
from the States.

146
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,990
- Dobbsy-
- Yes. Khao, I suggest we step inside.

147
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,830
Dobbsy.

148
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,950
Wait here, kid. We're gonna
fix you up nice with our friends here.

149
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,670
It's daylight bloody robbery.

150
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,230
He could get killed in the first fight.
Then what do I have?

151
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,110
The boy is good. I've seen him fight.
Have I ever lied to you?

152
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,390
This is the offer.
Take it or leave it.

153
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,550
Hey, kid! Kid!

154
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,750
This is gonna turn out
to be your lucky day.

155
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,190
Great news, Chris. There is a ship due
in two weeks, and you are on it.

156
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,110
No need to thank us.

157
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,470
Oh, uh, remember what I told you.
Watch out for your tail.

158
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,390
Watch my tail.

159
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,910
Harry.

160
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,710
How many weeks?

161
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:21,070
Ah, this is great.

162
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,190
Dobbsy, this is gonna be
the best one we ever had.

163
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:26,230
I do hate long good-byes.

164
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:10,190
Be ready at all times.
You will learn that...

165
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:13,430
or you'll never become
Muay Thai fighter.

166
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,990
I need some help.
Take me home.

167
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,350
And take care
of Billy, Red, the kids.

168
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,470
Hey. Leave him alone.

169
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,670
Yeah, you. Yeah, you now.

170
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:28,630
Yeah. Always be ready.

171
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,470
Well.

172
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,310
Forget it, Dobbs.

173
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:03,510
Fifty pounds says I can gain
her most intimate confidence.

174
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,030
Come on, Dobbs.

175
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,110
Trust me, Harry.
Waiter?

176
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,070
Yes, sir.

177
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,550
The young lady who just came in.

178
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,630
Would you ask her if she'd care
to partake of a flute of champagne?

179
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,310
- Say it came from-
- Lord Dobbs?

180
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:23,470
Yes, sir. Castle in Scotland,
factories in Singapore.

181
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,390
- Smart lad.
- Thank you.

182
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,310
Castle in Scotland?

183
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:34,670
Excuse me, miss. The gentleman
over there would like to see you.

184
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,110
Thank you.

185
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:54,350
- I'm sorry. Do we know one another?
- I can't be sure, Miss-

186
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,590
- Newton.
- Miss Newton.

187
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:00,110
Maybe it was my castle in Scotland
or our vineyards in the south of France?

188
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,030
- No.
- No matter. I shall remember.

189
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,710
Miss Newton.
By the way, I'm Lord Edgar Dobbs.

190
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,390
This is the president of my company,
Harry Smith, with an "i."

191
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:13,350
- Ma'am.
- Pleased to meet you. Carrie Newton.

192
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,030
Miss Carrie Newton.

193
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,910
- Will you join us?
- I just came in for some refreshment.

194
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,870
Well, then, take it
with us, please.

195
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,750
All right.
Thank you, my lord.

196
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,590
Edgar.

197
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,030
Let's dispense with silly titles.

198
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,350
So, what brings you to the Orient,
if I may inquire?

199
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,310
- I'm here on assignment.
- An assignment?

200
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:42,790
- Like a journalist?
- Yes. The "New York Globe."

201
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,230
- "New York Globe," huh?
- Hmm.

202
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:49,070
- Maybe we met through my father.
- Your father?

203
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,630
Howard Newton.
He owns the "Globe."

204
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:56,710
Howard Newton.
Oh, yes, a splendid chap.

205
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:07,350
They say you can buy anything
you desire on the streets of Bangkok.

206
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,470
And what is it you desire,
Lord Dobbs?

207
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:13,230
Oh-ho, a great number of things,
but what about you, m'dear?

208
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,910
- Well, what any woman desires.
- Oh?

209
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,670
A great story.

210
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,590
- What's he saying?
- Harry?

211
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,910
Somethin' about Muay Thai tournament
tonight. Fighting or somethin'.

212
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,630
That's what I desire.

213
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:55,150
Brutality?
That's strictly for peasants.

214
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,990
I am a journalist.

215
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,750
All right.
Harry will arrange it.

216
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,070
- Noisy, isn't it?
- Yeah.

217
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,990
- I warned you it was for peasants.
- We'll get a seat over here.

218
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,470
Dobbs!

219
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,470
Khao. What a lovely surprise.

220
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,990
You are a thief, Dobbs.

221
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:55,830
- You sold me rusty rifles.
- Nothing that a little oil won't cure.

222
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:59,470
Nice American lady.
A very important journalist.

223
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:04,430
Carrie Newton.
Very good friend of Lord Dobbs.

224
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,790
Might write nice things
about Muay Thai fighting.

225
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,630
Make you famous in the
United States of America.

226
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,550
Oh, I see.
It's my pleasure to meet you.

227
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:18,030
Please, have a seat up there
with my good friend Lord Dobbs.

228
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,030
My God.

229
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,070
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

230
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:35,030
- Let's go.
- You have to get me this story.

231
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,910
I'll arrange it.

232
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,510
- Did you see him?
- Of course I saw him. Just keep moving.

233
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,670
- Did you see him?
- Keep moving.

234
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:52,070
Chris.

235
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:56,750
- We were looking for you, weren't we?
- Yeah, we were lookin' for you.

236
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,990
Good to see you again, my boy.

237
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,430
You've put on
a little muscle.

238
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:07,750
You've become famous.
I always said you'd make it.

239
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,670
- Didn't I?
- Mm-hmm.

240
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,950
You owe me.

241
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:16,950
Yes, I do, Chris,
and I always repay my debts.

242
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,870
What do you want?

243
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,990
- The golden dragon.
- Golden what?

244
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,430
The golden dragon
in the Lost City.

245
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,670
Lost City?

246
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,830
The best fighters will meet
to compete in secret...

247
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,670
for a big dragon
made of solid gold.

248
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,190
- Solid gold.
- Solid gold.

249
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,590
You think you can win?

250
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:49,750
No.

251
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,990
You're learning.

252
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,590
What exactly do you
want me to do?

253
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:00,270
You buy me back from Khao
and finance my trip to the Lost City.

254
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,310
Carrie Newton.

255
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,990
What'd I miss?

256
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:10,710
Chris, my son, it is fortuitous,
us meeting like this.

257
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,230
A bloody gold dragon, eh?
Well, I'll tell you what.

258
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:16,910
You get us to the Lost City,
and I'll make sure that you-

259
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:21,430
We come back
with the gold dragon.

260
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:29,710
Deal.

261
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,190
- Yeah, Newman, I got it.
- No, it's "Newton."

262
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,670
N- E-W-T-O-N.

263
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:42,110
- Do you have a table?
- Lord Dobbs.

264
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,230
It's all right, waiter.
He's with us.

265
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,470
- I need a way to get on the journey.
- Find your own, lady.

266
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,310
Well, how about at least
printing a teaser on the story?

267
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:59,350
Okay, you get me a photo, and
I might get it in "Around the World."

268
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,790
Wait. Here's the wire.

269
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:06,070
Aren't you who we sent
to the Orient to get out of our hair?

270
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:09,230
Hello!
Hey, Newman, you there?

271
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,430
- Oh, my God.
- Hello!

272
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,470
You see, Chris...

273
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:18,510
the problem is that you can't get
into this wretched Ghan gheng thing...

274
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,710
without a special invitation.

275
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,430
- We'll forge it.
- Impossible.

276
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:29,110
Apparently, it has a map on it,
so we are faced with a real dilemma.

277
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:35,350
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Miss Newton.

278
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,510
What are you so cheerful about?

279
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:41,550
Because, my lord, I hold in my hand
your ticket to that journey.

280
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:44,910
Not so fast.
First we make a deal.

281
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,990
What kind of deal?

282
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,350
I go with you
to the Ghan gheng.

283
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,990
- How do we know it's good?
- Oh, it's good.

284
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,430
It's very good.

285
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,350
Without it,
your plans are worthless.

286
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:19,910
- That's me. Devine. I need some help.
- Come with me.

287
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,230
- Mr. Devine?
- That's me.

288
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:42,150
Welcome to Bangkok.

289
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,990
I am Edgar Dobbs
of the Ghan gheng committee.

290
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:49,510
This is Harry Smith and
Christopher Dubois, your personal valet.

291
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,910
Hey, this is great.
I thought I was gonna get stuck...

292
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,510
with a couple of Oriental fellas
didn't speak no English.

293
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,630
Oh, not for you, champ.
Chris, the bags.

294
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,910
Dobbs, I'm gonna kill you.

295
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,870
Not yet.
Remember:

296
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,750
It's thieves with pride
that dangle from the gallows.

297
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,830
Who said that?

298
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,590
Edgar Dobbs, lvory Coast, 1920.

299
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:20,310
Besides, Chris, my son,
we have an almost perfect plan.

300
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:28,590
Maxie has the map and the invitation
that will get us into the Lost City.

301
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,310
All that will be on his mind
is fighting.

302
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,270
Miss Newton is off getting
her story of the century...

303
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:38,030
and in the meantime,
you, Harry and yours truly...

304
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:42,390
will be devising ways and means
of stealing the dragon.

305
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:47,590
- Yeah. Sounds good to me.
- Good?

306
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:52,590
It is perfect. All we have to do
is keep the champ in our pocket.

307
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:59,270
- So, we ready to go?
- Thank you.

308
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,190
Well, now, who is this?

309
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:06,030
Carrie Newton. It's a pleasure to meet
the heavyweight champion of the world.

310
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,430
- Is she goin' with us?
- Somebody to record the historic event.

311
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,350
Let's get goin'.

312
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:14,470
Her father owns the "New York Globe."

313
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:17,870
- Well, whoop-de-doo.
- All right, make a pretty picture.

314
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,590
Smile.

315
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,510
Come on. Smile!

316
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,710
Now what?

317
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,030
Trust me.

318
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,790
Man, boss,
these elephants are bustin' my rump.

319
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:11,310
Oh, stop complaining, Harry.
We could be back in Cairo on camels.

320
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,870
Where'd you get
the haircut- the army?

321
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:19,950
No, I'm, uh-
I'm a sailor.

322
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,790
I'll tell you what. You look like
you're in pretty good shape.

323
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,670
I'll work you out, give you
a few pointers. Who knows?

324
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,990
Maybe you'd make a good fighter.
Now that's the way to earn some money.

325
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,550
Yeah.

326
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,630
Yep, that's a pretty lady.

327
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:52,910
- Oh, my achin' rump.
- Elephants.

328
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,750
From now on in, it's horses.

329
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:24,470
Dobbs. I'm gonna go for a walk.

330
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,670
Oh, be careful, boy-o.

331
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,990
Taken one?

332
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,750
A funeral.

333
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:52,310
No headstones.
That's how they bury thieves here.

334
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,830
Makes them give back to the earth.

335
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:02,510
Hey, Dobbs,
what do you drink with tonic?

336
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,430
Don't tell me.

337
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,790
- Gin.
- I said don't tell me.

338
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,310
Shut up, you!

339
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,430
The Americans!

340
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:43,310
Welcome to our humble inn.

341
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,670
Thank you.

342
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:05,070
- What the hell is this?
- Fresh-killed cobra, champ.

343
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:09,550
Well, I always say one should never eat
on an empty stomach.

344
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:13,150
I'm for that.

345
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,550
Well, isn't this a small world?

346
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:35,030
Khao, my old friend,
I just realized I owed you some money.

347
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:38,710
- Harry?
- You didn't pay him?

348
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:42,990
No, he didn't pay me.
He's a thief. I'm used to him.

349
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,750
But you-

350
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:50,830
You are worse. You dare go to
the Ghan gheng to fight against us...

351
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:54,350
after we've trained you in the ways
of the Muay Thai warrior.

352
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:58,550
You got it all wrong, pops.
He ain't gonna fight. I am.

353
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:01,070
Correct.

354
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:06,230
That is correct.
This is Maxie Devine, the champ.

355
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,230
You are a fighter?

356
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,510
What are you talkin' about?

357
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:13,550
- What the hell's goin' on here?
- He's just talking nonsense.

358
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,310
It's gotten
a little quiet, hasn't it?

359
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,790
Now, as I was saying...

360
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:32,270
before I was so rudely interrupted
by Mr. Khao-

361
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,750
Excuse me, honorable sir.

362
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,790
We need this table.

363
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:58,190
- So do we.
- But-

364
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:01,110
You heard him!
Now beat it.

365
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,510
I said-

366
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,590
I say, do you speak English?

367
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:18,190
He knows what you're saying.

368
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,670
Hey, pal, scram.

369
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:28,470
Easy, kid.
It ain't worth it.

370
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,550
What the hell is this?

371
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:53,390
That's what you'll
face at the Ghan gheng.

372
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:00,190
Good morning, champ.

373
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:04,390
Good morning, my ass.
You think I was born yesterday?

374
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:07,430
You don't have anything to do
with this damn Ghan gheng, do ya?

375
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:10,710
Huh? And you're no valet, either.

376
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:13,390
You're nothin' but
a cheap, lyin' punk.

377
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:16,590
- Take it easy.
- Take it easy?

378
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:20,430
You ain't no fighter, either. You
wouldn't last one round in a real fight.

379
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:22,670
- Whaddya think of that?
- Hey.

380
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,230
You want some?

381
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:32,590
Huh?

382
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:35,310
Come on. Come on!

383
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:51,150
Maxie.

384
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:53,190
No more.

385
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:57,390
No more.

386
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:18,630
Is this what you're after?

387
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:50,990
So what are you looking
so glum about?

388
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:52,910
"Maxie Devine."

389
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:27,910
This is, uh, Maxie Devine,
champion of America.

390
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:05,110
Welcome to Ghan gheng.

391
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,950
Kishu Yama from Japan.

392
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,190
Phang Prahan of Siam.

393
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,150
I am Phang.

394
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:44,350
Maxie Devine of America.

395
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:49,470
That's me.

396
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:52,590
Maxie Devine,
heavyweight champion of the world.

397
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:00,270
This man is
a better fighter than me...

398
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:02,710
and as the former
heavyweight champion...

399
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:08,310
I turn my title over to him.

400
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:18,550
This here's your man,
Christopher Dubois.

401
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,910
Dubois will be granted
a chance to prove...

402
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:36,190
if he is a worthy combatant
in the first round.

403
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:40,110
If not, Maxie Devine
shall pay the penalty...

404
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:42,950
and never leave the Lost City.

405
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:04,910
That thing is
bigger than I thought.

406
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:15,150
Why did you come back?

407
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:19,270
I've been champion a long time...

408
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,830
and you beat me...
with your legs, with your speed.

409
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:27,510
Besides, when I got
the invitation to come here...

410
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:31,350
I decided I was gonna see the American
flag flyin' at the end of this thing.

411
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:35,510
I don't know what's
on your mind, Chris...

412
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:38,270
but I do know a champion
when I meet one...

413
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:40,750
and I'm here to see
that you fight like one.

414
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:45,510
Now you know why.

415
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,750
Here in the Lost City...

416
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:20,950
at the top of the world...

417
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:24,790
we greet our first heroes.

418
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:29,590
In this mystical arena...

419
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:33,430
there are no masks-
just truth.

420
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,870
I wish you well.

421
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:58,550
Soviet Union against Spain.

422
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:57,110
Damn.

423
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:15,790
Japan against Okinawa.

424
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,350
Come.

425
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:58,990
France against Brazil!

426
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:07,550
dd Oh-yay-oh-yay
Oh-yay-oh-yay dd

427
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,510
dd Oh-yay-oh-yay
Oh-yay-oh-yay dd

428
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:25,390
dd Oh-yay-oh-yay Oh-yay-oh-yay dddd

429
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:44,270
Ohh!

430
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:17,990
China against Korea!

431
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,630
He's moving like an animal.

432
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:00,950
More like a snake.

433
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:12,230
Harry, our little pension fund.

434
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:14,790
Yeah.

435
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:18,510
Hey, boss, how come there ain't nobody
watching this thing?

436
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:21,350
Well, 'cause they don't think
anybody can lift it.

437
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:31,990
- Chris, how are you feeling?
- The kid's a winner.

438
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:35,190
Of course he is,
for at least one round.

439
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:37,670
I mean, for your sake.

440
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,790
After all,
you don't want to become...

441
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:42,710
a permanent resident
of the Lost City, do you?

442
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:45,110
He should be in training.

443
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:51,030
- I know you'll win the first round.
- Yeah.

444
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:53,030
You're gonna win
the whole thing.

445
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,350
You're going to split
the prize with them?

446
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:57,670
We have a deal.

447
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:59,590
So do we.

448
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:10,230
Turkey against Scotland!

449
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:55,590
Hey!

450
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:57,910
Ohh! Aaah!

451
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,550
Ooh!

452
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:24,590
Siam against Africa!

453
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:27,590
dddd

454
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:11,910
Aaah!

455
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:40,110
Germany against United States!

456
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:43,190
Chris, I don't know about you...

457
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:45,510
but I plan on seeing
Times Square again.

458
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:47,590
Get 'im!

459
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:32,390
He's outclassed.

460
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:39,910
Hope you enjoy Christmas
in the Lost City.

461
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:43,470
New York City!

462
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:03,110
Aaah!

463
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:06,190
Yeah!

464
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:23,150
Yeah! Yeah!

465
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:39,670
Mongolia against Greece!

466
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:40,950
This guy's no big deal.

467
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:52,190
Japan against Turkey!

468
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:12,590
Huh!

469
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:45,670
Hyah!

470
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:19,950
Ha-ha!

471
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:28,950
Hyah!

472
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:35,910
Now he's got a style
like a monkey.

473
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:47,150
Mongolia against Siam!

474
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:33,110
Aaah!

475
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:37,230
It's over.
Hit the gong!

476
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:43,270
No!

477
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:56,750
- Phang.
- Chris, sit down!

478
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:36,710
Chris?

479
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:39,630
We need a little chat.

480
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:41,550
Okay.

481
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:44,870
Tomorrow you are
throwing the fight.

482
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:49,670
- Throwing the-
- Takin' a dive.

483
01:07:49,710 --> 01:07:53,110
- A plunge, kid.
- You see, it is the perfect setup.

484
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:55,350
That dragon is so
bloody enormous...

485
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:57,710
if we're going to lift it out of here,
we need you healthy.

486
01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:02,150
Well, let's face it.
You have been lucky so far.

487
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,630
Why the long face?

488
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:11,590
I thought this was your quest,
your dream.

489
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:13,990
Well, soon it'll be a reality.

490
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:21,390
Harry, I think the kid
needs some rest.

491
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:23,310
Sleep well.

492
01:08:56,110 --> 01:08:59,510
Spain against United States!

493
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:21,190
Up. Get up!

494
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:26,310
Get up!

495
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:43,350
Yeah! How 'bout that?
The kid can really take a beating.

496
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:57,270
It's time for plan "B."

497
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:01,030
What's plan "B"?

498
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:03,070
Semifinal.

499
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:06,350
Mongolia against Japan!

500
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:10,630
See, the winner's gonna wear himself
out, then he'll roll right over for you.

501
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:14,790
This is good.

502
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:53,270
Aaah! Ohh!

503
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:20,630
Lucky punch.

504
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:24,510
Yeah. Yeah.

505
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:26,430
Lucky punch.

506
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:49,110
Come on, Dobbsy!
Dobbs, come on!

507
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:55,510
Come on. Dobbs!

508
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:57,030
Come on!

509
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:02,870
Secure it!

510
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:04,790
Semifinal.

511
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:08,390
United States against China!

512
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:12,550
A tiger.

513
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:37,110
Hurry it up!
I can't hold this forever!

514
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:41,110
- Yeah! All right, Dobbs!
- Is it secure?

515
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:43,190
Yeah!
What about me?

516
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:51,950
Come on!
Let's get out of here!

517
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:56,750
Hey, Dobbs!
You bastard!

518
01:13:56,830 --> 01:13:58,670
What about me?

519
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:00,710
I'll see you outside the gates.

520
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:03,110
Trust me, Harry.

521
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:33,550
Dobbs, we got company.

522
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:36,870
Run for it, Harry!

523
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:57,230
Dobbs!

524
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:12,430
What a mess.

525
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:13,950
Oh, yeah?

526
01:15:14,030 --> 01:15:17,990
I'm sorry, kid,
we tried to run out on you.

527
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:21,030
I guess that's
the difference between us.

528
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:25,110
I've never, ever said I was
sorry before, and meant it.

529
01:15:25,190 --> 01:15:28,310
And I never, ever
had a quest...

530
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:31,790
that wasn't for me,
number one.

531
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:38,350
I wasn't always
a pirate, you know.

532
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:41,710
Believe it or not,
for over 20 years...

533
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:44,270
I was a genuine captain...

534
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:46,910
in the Royal Navy.

535
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:50,710
I raised the Union Jack in countries
you never even heard of...

536
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:53,430
fought the Hun in the great war.

537
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:55,350
For what?

538
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:59,270
For glory of God, the British Empire
and His Majesty the King.

539
01:15:59,310 --> 01:16:02,950
And when it was all over,
what was I left with?

540
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:11,430
Oh, well, you win some...

541
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:14,350
you lose some.

542
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:20,070
Now, you just watch
your tail, my old son.

543
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:43,630
These men have committed
a great sacrilege...

544
01:16:43,710 --> 01:16:47,110
against this competition.

545
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:51,510
Let it be known that the price
for such betrayal...

546
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:54,150
is death!

547
01:16:58,870 --> 01:17:01,030
No!

548
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:03,990
I will pay for their freedom.

549
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:05,910
I brought them here.

550
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:08,790
It's my fault.

551
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:11,190
If I win, they'll go free.

552
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:15,990
You'll keep the dragon.

553
01:17:29,070 --> 01:17:31,550
This is for good.

554
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:35,350
So be it.

555
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:53,910
Final event!

556
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:55,830
Mongolia...

557
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:58,990
against United States!

558
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:33,710
Cover up!

559
01:19:03,150 --> 01:19:05,870
Yeah!

560
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:10,310
Cover up!

561
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:32,110
Chris!

562
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:55,670
Get up! Chris! Get up!

563
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:12,870
Come on.

564
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:34,310
We're dead, Dobbs.
We're dead!

565
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:36,910
I won't say it again, Harry.
Shut up!

566
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:26,070
Chris!

567
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:36,110
Chris, give yourself
some room!

568
01:21:36,190 --> 01:21:38,030
Chris!

569
01:21:48,190 --> 01:21:50,070
Chris!

570
01:21:53,390 --> 01:21:56,470
Boss, this don't sound good.

571
01:21:58,350 --> 01:22:01,030
Don't sound good at all.

572
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:04,550
At least while they're shouting,
it means he's still alive.

573
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:31,750
Chris, you got him!
Now get in there and finish him!

574
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:33,670
- Go, go, go!
- Yeah! Yeah!

575
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:46,710
Come on!

576
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:49,070
Yeah!

577
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:20,550
Come on!

578
01:24:24,710 --> 01:24:26,390
Aaah!

579
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:41,550
Yeah!

580
01:24:45,270 --> 01:24:48,110
You've done it!
Chris!

581
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:50,990
Chris! Chris! Chris!

582
01:24:51,070 --> 01:24:53,110
Chris, it's me, Maxie!
Chris!

583
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:55,310
It's all right, kid.

584
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:57,230
You did it.

585
01:25:19,470 --> 01:25:21,870
Christopher Dubois, we honor you...

586
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:25,150
as the greatest warrior
of the Ghan gheng.

587
01:25:40,430 --> 01:25:42,510
Hey, way to go, champ.

588
01:25:42,590 --> 01:25:44,430
Thanks.

589
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:53,030
Christopher, now that you are
the undisputed champion...

590
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:55,070
- I've been thinking.
- About what?

591
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:58,030
A plan, a perfect plan.

592
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:05,150
Oh, I don't think he wants
to hear about it now, Harry.

593
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:11,590
I didn't get the golden dragon...

594
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:14,510
but I returned to New York,
like I promised.

595
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:17,230
I got the kids off the streets.

596
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:20,110
In the end, we all did just fine.

597
01:26:38,590 --> 01:26:42,950
Maxie trained many great fighters
and became a big celebrity.

598
01:26:44,230 --> 01:26:47,270
Last I heard, Dobbs and Harry
opened a trading post...

599
01:26:47,310 --> 01:26:49,990
deep in the Amazon.

600
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:52,630
Bless their souls.

601
01:26:53,305 --> 01:26:59,480
