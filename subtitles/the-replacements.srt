2
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,875
Hike!

3
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,596
Martel!

4
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,511
Martel, you're a wimp!

5
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,792
l can't believe that.
Martel goes for a give-up slide.

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,992
-lt did look cautious.
-l could have scored on that!

7
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,111
That could be the last play of the season.

8
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,272
In case you haven't heard,
the players' strike became official...

9
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,032
...at 4 p.m. Eastern time.

10
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,073
I'm sad that the players' demands,
which center around...

11
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,955
...a rise in the current salary cap,
have been rejected by the owners.

12
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,755
I have told my union brothers to walk.

13
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,679
Get me Jimmy McGinty!
Have him here tonight.

14
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,869
Yes, sir.

15
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,432
I'm here with Eddie Martel.

16
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,116
A lot of angry fans out there feel
that the players are being too greedy.

17
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,828
Anything you'd like to say?

18
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,878
Dwight, I know $5 million a year
sounds like a lot of money...

19
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,430
...but I have to pay 10 percent to my agent,
5 percent to my lawyer--

20
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,318
Do you know what insurance costs
on a Ferrari, mother--

21
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,551
Pat, back to you.

22
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,354
That was Washington running back
Malcolm Lamont.

23
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,791
It's all about money, folks,
but isn't it always?

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,117
Yes. This is Pat Summerall
for John Madden saying...

25
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,436
...so long from Nextel Stadium.

26
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,432
-You look like shit.
-l'm dying, Jimmy.

27
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,909
Come on.

28
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,671
You've been dying for 20 years.

29
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,510
-Give me a cigarette.
-l quit.

30
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,036
Nobody likes a quitter.

31
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,117
-See the game today?
-No.

32
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,555
Why, you liar.

33
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,474
Could you believe that slide by Martel?

34
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,311
What a pussy.

35
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,713
-What's up?
-Take a ride with me.

36
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,239
How's the wife?

37
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,158
She had her lips done.

38
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,360
l never even knew
you could have your lips done.

39
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,039
Looks like a largemouth bass.

40
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,117
l'm too old to screw around.
Let me give it to you straight.

41
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,349
l want you back.

42
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,988
-You already have a coach.
-l'll take care of it.

43
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,112
-Like you took care of me.
-Now, Jimmy....

44
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,714
Your players all flew home
to their castles...

45
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,273
...in their private jets.

46
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,391
We're gonna finish the season anyway.

47
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,750
l'm gonna use replacement players.

48
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,669
-Jeez, what a business.
-We've got four games left.

49
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,037
We win three, we're in the playoffs.

50
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,516
Really? Win three out of four
with replacement players?

51
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,159
That's not too much to ask.

52
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,154
You won for me once, you can do it again.

53
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,233
What's the matter, Jimmy?

54
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,592
Nobody's gonna give you
a better chance than this...

55
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,632
...after that Dallas mess.

56
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,431
-l was right about that.
-lt had nothing to do with being right!

57
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,154
You went head-to-head
with an $8 million quarterback.

58
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,676
Who did you think was gonna win?
That's not gonna happen here!

59
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,158
l'm talking about a team
of poor nobodies who play to win...

60
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,316
...not a bunch of bitchy millionaires.

61
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,155
Come on, Jimmy!

62
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,833
l'm thinking.

63
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,436
Hello!

64
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,876
Hello!

65
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,516
l want total control of my team.

66
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,349
l want to be able to recruit anybody
that l want, no interference.

67
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,513
My word is my bond.

68
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,918
l want it in writing.

69
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,913
Okay, Jimmy.

70
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,389
Okay.

71
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,830
We thought we'd skip
special teams for now.

72
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,037
lt'll be tough enough
to put together a team in a week.

73
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,708
-We're gonna go a different way.
-A different way?

74
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,038
Here's a list of people
l've been watching over the years.

75
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,152
They've all played football,
not all of them in the pros.

76
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,000
But they all have something
unique to bring to the game.

77
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,992
We'll take them and try
to put together a winning team.

78
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,158
lf nothing else,
they should be fun to watch.

79
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,832
Daniel Bateman, SWAT team officer.

80
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,870
Awarded a Purple Heart for losing
a kidney during the Gulf War.

81
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,119
A walk-on at Michigan State
before he gave up football...

82
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,278
...to sneak back into the service
for one more tour of duty.

83
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,869
Clifford Franklin.

84
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,510
Great attitude, great desire, and
the fastest son of a bitch l've ever seen.

85
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,592
Clifford! Twinkie!

86
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,669
What's up, man? Got any Twinkies?

87
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,949
Can he catch?

88
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,908
That's why l have you.

89
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,792
Andre and Jamal Jackson.

90
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,629
Together, these guys were the best
tandem team of guards in the game.

91
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,713
-You're kidding me!
-Andre got traded and they fell apart.

92
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,674
He ain't our problem no more.
We gonna play football.

93
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,308
-Football?
-Football.

94
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,433
Nigel Gruff.

95
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,635
Striker out of Cardiff,
now residing in Hell's Kitchen.

96
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,239
He's called ''The Leg'' because he can kick
a soccer ball the length of the field.

97
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,628
Gentlemen...

98
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,877
...the drinks are on the house!

99
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,995
Bollocks!

100
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,796
Pissing away our money again?

101
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,111
-No, the money's on the way.
-Where? To the OTB?

102
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,880
l got a winning horse!
l swear on my mom's grave!

103
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,913
Your mother's grave?
He's swearing on his mother's grave!

104
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,156
Nigel, listen. l want my money!

105
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,954
-Has he kept in shape?
-By Welsh standards.

106
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,469
Shane Falco.

107
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,432
Shane Falco?
''Footsteps'' Falco from Ohio State?

108
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,675
The same.

109
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,436
-He hasn't played in years.
-Should be well rested then.

110
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,710
You look like a swordfish l caught once.

111
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,950
He hit the deck just like that.

112
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,996
-You know who l am?
-Yeah.

113
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,113
You're Jimmy McGinty.

114
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,834
That old coach from the '80s.

115
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,638
We met just before the Sugar Bowl.

116
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,359
l remember.

117
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,836
Hell of a game that Sugar Bowl.

118
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,875
-What'd you lose that by? 40 points?
-That would be 45.

119
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,310
Sometimes a game like that sticks
with you. You never shake it off.

120
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,870
-Got three concussions to prove it.
-That's why girls don't play.

121
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,674
Why are you here, coach?

122
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,399
l'm back with the Sentinels.
l want you to quarterback.

123
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,114
l found the best guards
and a wide receiver...

124
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,792
...even you couldn't overthrow.

125
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,952
-l'm retired.
-Retired?

126
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,038
lt looks like things have gone
real well for you since.

127
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,233
l got no complaints.

128
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,233
lt's quiet here.

129
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,395
Nobody bothers me.

130
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,395
That's the great thing about plankton,
it pretty much keeps to itself.

131
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,319
You know what separates the winners
from the losers?

132
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,595
The score.

133
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,955
Getting back up
after being kicked in the teeth.

134
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,508
l watched films of your games
since the Sugar Bowl.

135
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,036
You shouldn't have been trying
to carry the whole team that first year.

136
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,470
Your teammates leaned on you
and you crumbled.

137
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,799
-ls that how you want to be remembered?
-l don't want to be remembered at all.

138
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,829
You're young. lf you do well,
who knows what'll happen after the strike.

139
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,595
l'm not making you any promises,
but why don't you take a chance?

140
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,755
Rather than scraping crap
off the bottom of somebody else's toys.

141
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,589
Think it over.

142
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,872
You could be part of something.

143
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,157
l'm here to remind fans that what
the owners are doing is unconscionable.

144
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,751
They have blatantly hired scabs...

145
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,473
...which goes against our Constitution,
the Declaration of Independence...

146
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,036
...and the Emancipation Proclamation.
Here come the scabs now!

147
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,788
That's Eddie Martel!

148
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,149
That's Wilson Carr!

149
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,714
Hey, Wilson!

150
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,269
l love you, man! What's happening?

151
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,029
l love you, man!

152
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,758
l'm gonna bust a cap in your ass,
and in your ass!

153
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,149
Piss off!

154
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,949
Piss off!

155
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,436
Get that bible out of here!

156
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,388
Sorry about this.

157
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,590
Put God in your heart!

158
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,239
l'm very sorry.

159
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,440
Get a job, you wankers!

160
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,874
Looking good out there!
You've got the goods!

161
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,275
Where did you learn to catch like that?

162
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,914
Roberts, make that D-back commit
before you cut, all right?

163
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,629
Jimmy.

164
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,589
-My tight end is deaf.
-Yeah, l know.

165
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,553
Jimmy, how am l gonna coach a deaf man?

166
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,789
You won't need to.

167
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,356
Brian Murphy would've gone
in the first round if he wasn't deaf.

168
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,275
Played college ball
here in D.C. at Gallaudet.

169
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,278
But l've got to be able
to communicate with him and how....

170
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,199
Learn to sign.

171
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,389
Horseshit!

172
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,354
Look at it this way,
he'll never be called offsides on an audible.

173
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,313
-Good to see you.
-You too.

174
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,317
-How are you?
-Good.

175
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,549
This is ''The Leg''?

176
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,115
l thought you told me he was solid muscle.

177
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,998
He's much stronger than he looks.

178
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,033
l'm wiry.

179
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,192
Go get some kicks in.

180
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,314
He's ''wiry.''

181
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,869
''Wiry.''

182
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,594
l'm sure you've been briefed
as to your situation.

183
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,228
Coach McGinty wanted you
with us for five weeks...

184
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,032
...and the Governor's complied.

185
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,435
Nice watch.

186
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,550
What?

187
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,795
This?

188
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,593
lt's a fake.

189
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,392
Damn thing's always broken.

190
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,718
lt's only right twice a day.

191
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,638
Why don't we join the others?

192
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,793
No sense standing here by ourselves...

193
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,752
...out of screaming distance.

194
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,828
-Come on, let's fire out of there!
-Jimmy.

195
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,077
-Falco, when's he coming?
-Relax, he'll be here.

196
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,389
Come on, quick feet!

197
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,075
l am relaxed, but that's not the point.
lt's nervous energy.

198
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,674
Case in point:
We don't have a quarterback, do we?

199
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,792
-Fire out of there!
-We don't have a game plan for Sunday.

200
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,788
The only good thing l can say
about our one offensive weapon is...

201
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,309
...it's ''wiry.'' What the shit is that?

202
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,714
No, no, it's ''wiry.''

203
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,798
-However the hell you say it!
-Say it: ''Wiry.''

204
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,676
''Wiry.''

205
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,633
Holy! Look at this mamma-jamma!

206
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,234
Have you lost weight?

207
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,948
Coach, don't say that.

208
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,108
You look great.
Why don't you work out on SOD?

209
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,389
SOD.

210
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,874
-He's lost weight?
-Sumo wrestler.

211
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,039
Expert at pushing people around.
That's what pass blocking is, remember?

212
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,189
That's right.

213
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,319
Next one, 74. Come on!

214
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,359
Set, hut!

215
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,948
All right! Way to go!

216
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,029
lt's all about pushing people around!
Set! Hut!

217
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,952
Come on, Sumo boy.
Let's see what you can do.

218
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,956
Set. Hut!

219
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,553
Yes! Good hit, Sumo boy!
Now get this off of me!

220
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,398
''That'll do, pig, that'll do.''

221
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,355
-Screw you, cockroach.
-You'll have to find your dick first.

222
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,596
Get this off of me!

223
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,472
Hey, scab!

224
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,034
-l don't want any trouble.
-You hear that?

225
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,919
He's taking away my job,
but he doesn't want any trouble.

226
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,549
Not only is he taking your job,
he's taking your parking space too.

227
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,835
What's up?

228
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,272
ls that right, Falco?

229
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,435
l didn't know it was yours. l'll move it.

230
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,039
No, let us do that.

231
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,914
Guys, move the new boy's ride for him.

232
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,156
Coming right up, Mr. Falco.

233
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,956
Ready?

234
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,279
One. Two. Three.

235
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,753
Thanks, guys.

236
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,389
Asshole.

237
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,757
Jesus! ''Footsteps'' Falco.
They must be getting desperate.

238
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,359
Hey, Falco!

239
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,636
You're not even a has-been!

240
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,116
You're a never-was!

241
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,109
Go!

242
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,069
Come on, let's pick it up!

243
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,078
Form a line here! Let's go seven on seven.

244
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,155
Check it out, it's our new quarterback.

245
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,158
We're in business now.

246
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,995
You're late.

247
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,394
Car trouble.

248
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,633
You still got an arm?

249
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,514
Hey, Falco.

250
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,469
Go!

251
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,153
That's gonna leave a mark.

252
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,712
-Leo, Franklin's down again.
-l'm okay.

253
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,275
l'm okay. l'm okay.

254
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,799
Let's play some football!

255
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,709
Danny Bateman.

256
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,479
Shane Falco.

257
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,954
Nice pop, Danny.

258
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,789
Thanks, coach.

259
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,792
ln practice, we don't hit the fellows
with the red shirts on.

260
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,913
l know, but l see that red
and l just want to go after it like a bull.

261
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,069
Okay, Danny.

262
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,675
Huddle up!

263
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,875
Get used to setting up on the run.
Move fast, think even faster.

264
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,833
-You'll live longer.
-l'm very interested in that.

265
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,069
Huddle up!

266
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,874
Hey! Shane Falco.

267
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,074
l lost a ton of money
on that Sugar Bowl of yours.

268
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,191
What a bloody shambles that was.

269
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,119
You could smell the stink
all the way back in Wales.

270
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,833
Nice meeting you.

271
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,356

Hut!

274
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,633
Shit! l forgot about the whole red
shirt thing! This game's confusing.

275
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,833
Remember...

276
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,469
...red means stop.

277
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,432

278
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,115
-Yeah.
-Get on up.

279
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,036
Go ahead. l'm gonna lie here
a moment and collect my thoughts.

280
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,713
Work shit out, right?

281
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,398
-You should be glad he's on your side.
-Yeah.

282

00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,396
l played one game in the pros,
l blew out my knee and that was it.

318
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,915
Shit.

319
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,592
All l want to do is score one touchdown
before l hang up my pads. That's it.

320
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,470
You'll get it.

321
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,790
Hey, man.

322
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,029
Wilkinson! Earl Wilkinson!

323
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,280
l knew l recognized you, man! l knew it!

324
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,397
You played for Minnesota, baby!

325
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,149
Oh, shit! Earl Wilkinson, man!
Oh, my God!

326
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,035
You'd have been All-Pro
if you hadn't beat up them cops!

327
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,516
What l had meant to say was ''allegedly''...

328
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,670
...allegedly beat up them cops
and because...

329
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,038
...a good Christian boy like you
would never do nothing like that!

330
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,755
That's right.

331
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,872
The way l heard it,
my man didn't even do nothing anyway!

332
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,355
Them cops were just jealous
of the black man.

333
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,080
Hear what l'm saying?
My boy's been living large!

334
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,431
l can't stand the cops!
l better not see a cop!

335
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,434
-l'll whup a cop's ass! Believe it!
-l'm a cop.

336
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,309
Look!

337
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,954
Bundt cake!

338
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,109
-Look at these yummy little monkeys!
-Hello!

339
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,469
Oh, hey.

340
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,073
Yeah.

341
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,120
-Are you Heather and Dawn?
-Yep, we sure are.

342
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,038
You don't know how excited l am...

343
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,391
...that l actually have some girls
with dance experience!

344
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,797
-l'm excited too!
-l know! Me too, too.

345
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,676
So, Heather, you were in Cats,
which is so terrific--

346
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,879
No, Pussycats.

347
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,992
You know, the club next to the airport?
Pussycats.

348
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,792
-That style of dancing would be--
-ls lap-dancing a style?

349
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,678
No. l mean....

350
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,758
Oh, my God, l forgot to tell you something.

351
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,955
What?

352
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,672
She always does that.

353
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,918
l've seen all l need to see.

354
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,634
No way! l'm so excited!

355
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,750
Go suit up.

356
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,913
-Go down the tunnel and to the left.
-Okay.

357
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,832
lf you guys have any friends down
at the club, would you send them over?

358
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,032
-Sure.
-Yeah, absolutely.

359
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,510
Where are you going, Number 48?

360
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,072
l was watching you today.

361
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,155
You looked good.

362
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,710
Good release, strong arm.
You're gonna do fine.

363
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,909
Thanks.

364
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,712
l'm Annabelle Farrell.

365
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,554
-Shane Falco.
-l know.

366
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,797
l remember you
from the '96 Sugar Bowl game.

367
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,560
Didn't anybody have anything
better to do that day?

368
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,799
You should get some help
to turn this back over.

369
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,749
Yeah, l was thinking
l'd call AAA later or something.

370
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,160
-Do you want a lift?
-Yeah.

371
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,079
Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.

372
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,870
Why'd you stay in the pocket at practice?

373
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,514
l don't comment to quarterbacks
about style but...

374
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,030
...you need to keep scrambling
against Detroit, with Prescott back.

375
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,916
-Prescott hasn't crossed.
-He will on Sunday.

376
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,759
-lt's a secret so you can't prepare.
-How do you know?

377
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,480
My friend's a cheerleader for Detroit.
She tipped me.

378
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,114
He's left-sided,
shotgun formation, roll right.

379
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,992
Van Gundy's on the right.

380
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,953
He's been All-Pro two years,
but one of my cheerleaders...

381
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,349
...is friends with a girl
who broke up with him.

382
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,835
He's been drinking ever since she left him.

383
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,955
He's hung over! He's a good second
slower off the snap than usual.

384
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,633
l'll stick to the right side.

385
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,308
Unless what they say
about Martinez is true.

386
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,718
-That was fun.
-This is great! You live out here?

387
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,633
Which one's yours?

388
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,076
Here. You see that white yacht
with the satellite dish?

389
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,397
l'm the old houseboat next to it,
covered in seagull shit.

390
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,194
What did you name her?

391
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,794
Phyxsius.

392
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,555
-Phyxsius, what does that mean?
-''Putting to flight.''

393
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,314
You want to come onboard for a beer?

394
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,830
Nothing personal,
but l don't date football players.

395
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,719
l don't blame you.

396
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,399
Not even quarterbacks?

397
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,957
Especially not quarterbacks.
You guys are the biggest babies of all.

398
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,832
The biggest babies?

399
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,269
Yeah.

400
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,790
-Thanks for the ride.
-Good luck on Sunday.

401
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,196
-Be careful out there.
-l will.

402
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,556
Shane.

403
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,596
What's up?

404
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,668
Just...

405
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,114
...watching the game.

406
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,755
Nervous?

407
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,949
No.

408
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,629
l'm good.

409
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,790
Like a duck on a pond.

410
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,680
On the surface everything looks calm,
but...

411
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,192
...beneath the water, those feet
are churning a mile a minute.

412
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,754
You'll be fine.

413
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,313
Find a way to lead your team.
Earn their respect.

414
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,155
Yeah.

415
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,034
How are you doing?

416
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,989
Me?

417
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,035
l'm just another duck on the pond.

418
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,556
Coach, can l ask you a question?

419
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,435
-Yeah, shoot.
-Why me?

420
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,360
l look at you and l see two men...

421
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,438
...the man you are,
and the man you ought to be.

422
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,872
Someday, those two will meet.

423
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,790
Should make for a hell of a football player.

424
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,072
Get some sleep, kiddo.

425
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,950
You play professional football tomorrow.

426
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,834
Welcome to Nextel Stadium,
in our nation's capital.

427
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,838
l'm Pat Summerall and with me,
as always, is John Madden.

428
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,833
Detroit bought an entire semi-pro team
once the strike happened.

429
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,600
Washington is going with
a bunch of unknowns.

430
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,910
Although we'll see a few guys
we know today.

431
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,635
Like Shane Falco, that talented quarterback
who fell out of sight...

432
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,229
...after a disastrous showing
in the Sugar Bowl.

433
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,550
Having a little snacky-poo
before the game?

434
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,197
-lt does the body good.
-You are one crazy son of a bitch.

435
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,352
-You know how l know that?
-How?

436
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,238
Only a crazy son of a bitch
would eat eggs before a game!

437
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,719
l need to bulk up.

438
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,148
-You want one?
-No!

439
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,713
lt's good for you.

440
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,434
Sentinels, listen up.

441
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,956
Welcome to professional football.

442
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,235
Some will say
that your accomplishments...

443
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,877
...will soon be forgotten, you're not
real players, this isn't a real team.

444
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,071
And l say that is bullshit!

445
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,634
Because, as of today,
you're all professional football players.

446
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,628
You're being paid to play.
l want you to remember that because...

447
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,270
...the men whose places you've taken
forgot that a long time ago.

448
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,549
Bring it in here.

449
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,394
Bring it in, guys.

450
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,752
Let's play some football!

451
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,598
-D.C.
-All right!

452
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,355
For some of these players,
this is another shot...

453
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,471
...and a last shot for a guy like Falco.

454
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,909
Remember that beating he took
from Florida?

455
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,318
That's nothing compared to those beatings
he took in Seattle.

456
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,671
One thing we do know
is that Falco can take a hit.

457
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,316
Well, I'll tell you,
he's sure had a lot of practice at it.

458
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,712
Ladies and gentlemen,
your Washington Sentinels!

459
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,074
-Did you see that?
-That's a pretty good hit.

460
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,472
Will the medical trainers
please report to the east tunnel?

461
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,030
Maybe he was a little overanxious, huh?

462
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,116
And now,
the rest of the Washington Sentinels.

463
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,159
Kick-off!

464
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,395
Not bad, let's go!

465
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,710
There can only be one leader
out there, all right? You be it.

466
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,436
-That's where l stand.
-No, it's not.

467
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,870
-That's my spot in the huddle.
-lt's not.

468
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,640
-Get to your spot.
-Let's go, chopstick!

469
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,191
Let's play football! What do you say?

470
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,917
-lt's my spot now!
-Not for long, you tub of rice shit!

471
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,435
What's the problem?

472
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,558
You can't do jack shit!

473
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,798
-Pork rice!
-l'm Japanese, not Chinese!

474
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,479
Don't mess with my brother.

475
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,079
What's going on?

476
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,118
Something seems to be going on
in the huddle.

477
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,958
Falco's on his back.

478
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,594
They haven't had a play yet
and Falco's down.

479
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,759
He got hit by his own guy! He was
looking out his earhole for a minute!

480
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,478
This isn't a good sign.

481
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,835
-Am l hurt already?
-Your partner knocked your head off.

482
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,276
Let's go.

483
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,873
Come on, get it together!

484
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,236
l'm the quarterback.
l'm the only one who talks in the huddle.

485
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,510
-But he was in my spot.
-l don't give a shit!

486
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,749
Now huddle up.

487
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,757
lf you've got something to say,
raise your hand.

488
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,314
ls that understood?

489
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,710
Suppose you don't feel good,
or you're hurt.

490
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,911
Tell me before the huddle starts. Okay?

491
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,995
Okay, here we go.

492
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,148
DC Right, Switch, 25 Blast.

493
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,435
What?

494
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,512
-That's to the left?
-The right.

495
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,755
To the left!

496
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,108
Be quiet or they'll hear us, and then what?

497
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,948
Play game!

498
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,038
Number 16 on the offense! Five yards!

499
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,517
Well Pat, so far the Sentinels...

500
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,553
...have minus 10 yards offensively.

501
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,111
l've seen monkey-shit fights
at the zoo more organized than this!

502
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,597
DC Right, Pro, 424 Tomahawk,
on one, on one. Ready?

503
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,355
Ready?

504
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,358
l'm coming for you, Footsteps!

505
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,313
Green 22!

506
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,149
Hut! Hut!

507
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,955
Come on, Shane!

508
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,919
You could hear Falco's fillings
drop all the way up here!

509
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,829
Detroit takes over the football
with excellent field position.

510
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,553
''Give me an S!

511
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,159
''Give me an E!

512
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,759
''Give me an N!

513
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,313
''Give me a T!

514
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,555
''Give me an....''

515
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,198
''l! ''

516
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,431
We'll get them next time.

517
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,592
Eagle over, cover four!

518
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,028
On three, get ready!

519
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,910
All day, blue eyes!
lt's Christmas morning...

520
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,640
...and Santa's coming down the chimney!

521
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,395
l'm gonna bury your family!
l'm gonna bury your dog!

522
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,749
Champ, champ!

523
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,709
Now that's football!

524
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,472
You get it? You like it?

525
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,716
The Sentinels have set a record
for penalties in the first three minutes!

526
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,629
- We're still waiting for the stats on that.
-Personal foul!

527
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,316
Number 56 on the defense!
Half the distance to the goal!

528
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,909
Bateman on that one.
That was just a cheap shot.

529
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,999
-That should be worse than a penalty.
-They're walking right through us!

530
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,953
Touchdown, Detroit!

531
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,274
Don't worry about it.

532
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,794
Let's go!

533
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,872
Double-slot Zag, okay?

534
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,071
-What?
-l don't feel too good.

535
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,151
-Suck it up.
-Come on!

536
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,074
Jesus Christ!

537
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,159
-Eggs!
-That's ripe!

538
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,673
What'd you eat, man?

539
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,559
lf we don't move,
l'm going to blow chow, too.

540
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,594
We're in a huddle! Double-slot zag, 88--

541
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,835
Jesus!

542
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,749
Goddamn!

543
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,674
l tried to tell you, l can't be around
somebody puking or l start puking.

544
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,315
Shit.

545
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,198
Okay, okay!

546
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,435
On three...

547
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,076
...everyone move left. Ready?
Hut, hut, hut.

548
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,633
What the hell is that?

549
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,629
What?

550
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,718
John, how many years have we been
calling games together?

551
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,949
Nineteen, I think.

552
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,798
Ever seen anything like that?

553
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,474
Not on a football field.

554
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,631
-What are they doing?
-Beats me.

555
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,072
Look at it this way. lt's the first thing
we've done together as a team.

556
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,589
-Hey!
-Clean it up! Let's go!

557
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,910
Break!

558
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,116
Ready? Blue 42!

559
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,473
Blue 42!

560
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,955
Hut!

561
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,870
First down, Washington.

562
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,599
-Was it out of bounds?
-Yes, on 23.

563
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,514
-Blue Right, 60, X Post.
-Blue Right, 60, X Post!

564
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,633
Let's go, let's go!

565
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,038
Go, from four. Hut!

566
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,551
Now we're rolling!

567
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,270
Signs of life from Washington here.

568
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,592
That last completion by Falco
puts them back in field-goal range.

569
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,631
-Field goal, let's go!
-Field goal.

570
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,670
Nigel.

571
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,312
lt's over the bar, not under.
Okay? Go get 'em.

572
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,400
-Hold that.
-Here comes the field-goal team.

573
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,916
A 40-yard attempt for kicker Nigel Gruff,
against the wind.

574
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:55,631
Here's a guy from Wales,
and he's kicking his first field goal ever.

575
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,599
This is a tough distance.

576
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,753
Yeah, she's there! She's there!

577
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,716
-Boom! Boom!
-Nigel Gruff kicks and scores!

578
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,232
Halftime score: Washington 3, Detroit 14.

579
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,918
That's the second time
a Washington player has been...

580
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,277
-...knocked out by his own teammate.
-There's a rule in sports:

581
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,637
Don't do anything great if you can't handle
the congratulations.

582
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,559
-There is?
-Yup.

583
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,953
''Give me an S!

584
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,713
''Give me an E!

585
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,313
''Give me an N!

586
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,033
''Give me a T!

587
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,959
''Give me a....''

588
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,356
Watch the wheel!

589
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,439
All right, let's go!

590
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,316
Touchdown, Smith! That one gets
the Sentinels back into the game.

591
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,273
This guy is a heck of a player,
but I don't know him.

592
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,392
According to the Sentinels,
it says Ray Smith is--

593
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,114
That's weird!
No college given, no high school.

594
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,198
Just says he's been a resident
of the State of Maryland...

595
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,078
...for the last two years,
and he likes to embroider!

596
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,953
-He does some fancy work with the ball.
-Weird.

597
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,875
Ready!

598
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,395
Green 1 1 !

599
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,598
Green 1 1 !

600
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,909
Falco's sacked and the ball comes loose.

601
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,953
It's Detroit's ball
with only a minute remaining.

602
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,553
Let's go! Let's go!

603
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,998
Danny, Danny.

604
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,237
l need that ball. Get me the ball.

605
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,549
You need the ball.

606
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,159
-Get me the ball.
-The ball.

607
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,798
Are you gonna get me the ball?

608
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,272
l hope he doesn't kill somebody.

609
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,111
l'm back! l'm back!

610
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,799
Get the ball!

611
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,839
l got it!

612
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,550
Now that is all-Madden team!

613
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,313
-You're the man.
-l'm the man!

614
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,039
-You got me the ball.
-l got you the ball!

615
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,231
-Go sit down now, Danny.
-Okay.

616
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,509
-Number 56 recovers the ball.
-Falco!

617
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,834
We've gotta pass.
lt's gotta be in the end zone.

618
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,316
DC Right, Zig, 90 Eagle. You can do this.

619
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,795
All right? Let's do it! Come on!

620
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,674
-Blue 25!
-Here comes the pain, baby!

621
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,155
Blue 25!

622
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,399
-Check!
-What are you doing?

623
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,750
Check!

624
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,348
Black 32!

625
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,357
-What?
-He's changing the play.

626
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,635
He's checking off the run.
l told him to pass!

627
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,316
Shit!

628
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,997
Falco calls an audible
at the line of scrimmage...

629
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,829
...and Cochran almost has a touchdown!
What a heartbreaker for Washington.

630
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,350
Final score: Washington 10, Detroit 14.

631
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,716
lf l'd wanted Cochran to have that ball,
l'd have called it that way.

632
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,438
-l read blitz.
-Bullshit.

633
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,478
l put the game in your hands.
You got scared.

634
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,755
l read blitz.

635
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,993
Winners always want the ball
when the game's on the line.

636
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,671
WFAN, the Sports Fan's Show.
How do you feel about the strike?

637
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,271
The fans are getting screwed. I've got
season tickets I can't give away!

638
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,995
-What about the replacement players?
-They're nobodies.

639
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,597
''At first I was afraid
I was petrified

640
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,588
''Kept thinkin' I could never live
without you by my side

641
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,713
''But then I spent so many nights
Thinkin' how you did me wrong

642
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,955
''And I grew strong''

643
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,435
Why'd you play that dumb-ass song?

644
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,108
l put on The Commodores.
That shit just came on.

645
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,994
Can somebody please cut that bullshit off?

646
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,394
-We did the best we could do.
-You don't get points for trying.

647
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,909
Let's face it, boys,
we screwed the pooch today.

648
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,791
Hey, there they are!

649
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,439
Ladies and gentlemen...

650
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,552
...your Washington Sentinels!

651
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,518
He's the luckiest guy here. At least
he couldn't hear the booing today!

652
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,674
Hello! Anyone home? Did l hear an echo?

653
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,074
Where'd McGinty get Rain Man?
The Special Olympics?

654
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,636
No wonder they couldn't win.
He can't even order a drink!

655
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,198
-Lay off.
-Lighten up.

656
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,799
lt's not like he can hear.

657
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,029
l can.

658
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,309
What's that say?

659
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,035
''One good thing about being deaf,
you can ignore the assholes.''

660
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,073
You asshole.

661
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,749
That's funny.

662
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,192
lt's cool!

663
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,068
You had enough?

664
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,432
You've got shit for brains,
but you've got balls.

665
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,555
Thank you.

666
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,950
Danny, remember what l told you
about red shirts in practice?

667
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:37,631
Yeah.

668
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,472
-Forget about it.
-Okay.

669
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,795
Martel.

670
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,996
Who's the man? Who's the man?

671
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,713
Come on! Come on!

672
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,591
Come on, come on! Stop!

673
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,077
Let's play football, bitch!

674
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,951
We are all God's children here!

675
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,989
''And deliver thee into the hands
of brutish men''--

676
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,830
Ezekiel 21 :31 .

677
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,512
This is some more bullshit!

678
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,591
It's more of a homecoming for you.

679
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,591
You gonna be a funny man?

680
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,712
Bateman! Wilkinson!
Come on, guys, what are you doing?

681
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,438
Can't we all just get along?

682
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,595
Come on.

683
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,958
Why are we the only ones in this jail?

684
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,317
-Simple. They're winners.
-Hell, no. Not tonight.

685
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,950
That was pretty sweet,
you sitting on Wilson's head, Jumbo.

686
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,719
Thanks, Jamal.

687
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,956
He wasn't the only one
who kicked ass tonight.

688
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,349
You're the man tonight, Clifford Franklin!

689
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,029
What?

690
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,429
You were hiding behind the jukebox.
Wasn't he?

691
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,316
At first, l admit, l was afraid.

692
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,118
-Shit, l was petrified.
-You were petrified?

693
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,954
''Thinkin' l could never live
without you by my side''

694
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,634
-The Lord is by your side.
-Have mercy.

695
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:45,154
''And then l spent so many nights
thinkin' how you did me wrong

696
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,753
''And l grew strong''

697
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,190

''Just turn around now
'cause you're not welcome anymore''

706
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:16,949
Remember this?

707
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,713
''Weren't you the one
who tried to hurt me with goodbye?

-Four, five!

720

Okay, all right.

721
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,469
Frankie.

722
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,070
lf anything like this bar fight
happens again...

723
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,919
...there'll be no place
on the team for any of you.

724
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,198
-Do l make myself perfectly clear?
-Yes, sir.

725
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,352
Just for the record...

726
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,677
...l would've loved to have seen
Martel get his ass kicked.

727
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,108
Let's get out of here!

728
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:54,789
Hey, Shane.

729
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,193
What are you doing?

730
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,715
My job.

731
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,355
-You're a professional football player.
-Sure, this week.

732
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,995
When that's all over, you know...

733
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,636
...l'll be back here.
l don't want to lose my customers.

734
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,078
l was on my way to work.
Do you need a ride?

735
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,509
l'm good.

736
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,597
-l got my truck back.
-How is it?

737
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,357
Flatter. But it runs.

738
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,472
And you?
How are you running after last night?

739
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,628
You heard about that?

740
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,956
l think the whole town heard about that.

741
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,310
ls that from the game or the fight?

742
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,397
l'm not sure. lt's all blurred
into one big beating.

743
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,110
The good news is,
you guys got into a rhythm...

744
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,676
...apart from that vomiting thing,
which was on Sports Center.

745
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,269
Oh, God.

746
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,196
After that, the team was really clicking.

747
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,071
Yeah, it was starting to come together.

748
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,269
Yeah.

749
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,829
-You want to sit down?
-No, l should go.

750
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,753
Thanks for coming by.

751
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,516
-Wow. Ow.
-What?

752
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,233
Oh! Ow!

753
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,914
Jesus!

754
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,793
-lt looks worse than it feels.
-lt looks like hell.

755
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,557
-Then it looks exactly like it feels.
-Here.

756
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,669
Wild yam?

757
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,915
Yeah.

758
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:30,235
Don't laugh, it works.
lt's great for sore muscles and bruises.

759
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,792
-l use it all the time.
-You don't have to do that.

760
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,715
Will you put it on? You can barely move.
This will be a little bit....

761
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,354
-Cold!
-Sorry, sorry.

762
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,518
Here, your shoulders.

763
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,995
Better?

764
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,435
Better.

765
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,435
You're the first player l can remember...

766
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,200
...who cares more about his teammates
than himself.

767
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,309
That's something this team's been
missing for a really long time.

768
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,830
lt's a good thing you did last night.

769
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,789
lt was just stupid.

770
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,235
Thanks.

771
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,748
-l'm gonna be late for work.
-Practice?

772
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,313
No, actually, l have work.

773
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,468
We only make $50 a game.
Gotta pay the bills, right?

774
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,956
Mac's, down on A Street.
Come in, l'll buy you a beer.

775
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,999
All right, l'll do that.

776
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,032
Keep putting that yam on.

777
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,309
Guys!

778
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,038
You gotta be kidding.

779
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,232
l didn't park in your space.

780
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,271
No, no.

781
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,199
But, unfortunately,
you did park in Lamont's space.

782
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:22,270
-He's not nearly as lenient as l am.
-On three, fellas.

783
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,994
-We got this. We got this.
-You want to put the car back?

784
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,991
This is none of your business.

785
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,948
Shane is our business.

786
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,879
-We're the guards.
-And we protect our quarterback.

787
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,790
This is funny to them bozos.
You got a joke? You got a joke?

788
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,355
That's your ride right there, ain't it?

789
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,116
Yeah.

790
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,994
That's my windshield!

791
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,390
-Now, put the car back.
-Son of a bitch!

792
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,468
Son of a--

793
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,156
Oh, son of a bitch? l'm a son of a bitch?

794
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,833
Stop, stop!

795
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,513
Come on, goddamn it, help me!

796
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,239
You're gonna pay for this!

797
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,399
No, l'm not. Stop messing
with my man, that includes his ride.

798
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,953
And wax that motherfucker.

799
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,277
Give it a tune-up, too.

800
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,552
Ready to go to practice?

801
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,798
Yeah, let's do that.

802
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,309
-How's that arm?
-Good.

803
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,188
What's that smell?

804
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,669
Wild yam.

805
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,150
-That's nice.
-You like that?

806
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,553
And so, boys and girls,
if anybody does have any firearms...

807
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,228
...you need to turn them in
as soon as possible.

808
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,714
No questions asked.

809
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,394
Understood?

810
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,510
All right.

811
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,356
Okay, coach, it's all yours.

812
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:08,433
Last Sunday, l saw a team on the field
play as hard as they could...

813
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,437
...to win the football game.

814
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,469
We lost. Not because of effort or desire...

815
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,753
...but because of lack of leadership
and trust. One's been resolved.

816
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,430
But leadership means nothing
if a team doesn't believe in each other.

817
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:26,150
Players spend years together
before they develop trust.

818
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,796
l'm asking you to do it in a week,
not a reasonable request, but...

819
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,190
...these aren't reasonable times.

820
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,879
l know you all have concerns
about this Sunday.

821
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,793
But a real man...

822
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,434
...admits his fears.

823
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,070
l'm asking you to do that here, tonight.

824
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,913
Who wants to start?

825
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,559
Let's talk about fears.

826
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,633
Fears.

827
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,470
l'm scared of spiders, coach.

828
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:11,595
-That's not what l meant.
-l'm afraid of spiders, too.

829
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,520
Goddamn spiders freak me, too, fellas.

830
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,279
Well, l didn't mean that.

831
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,438
Ever get one of those spiders
crawling up your arm?

832
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,471
-Crawling on you?
-Damn!

833
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,797
Thanks, Jumbo. You can just
rock me to sleep tonight.

834
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,551
Okay, that's great, but l'm talking
about what scares us on the field.

835
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,352
Like spiders on the field?

836
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,390
Can we get beyond the spiders, please?

837
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:39,750
Bees.

838
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,509
Bees?

839
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,073
-Bees?
-Bees.

840
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,551
Anybody here afraid
of anything other than insects?

841
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,189
Come on.

842
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,229
Quicksand.

843
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,557
Shit, yeah!
Quicksand's a scary mother, man.

844
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,036
lt sucks you right in and even
if you scream, you get that muck--

845
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,958
l don't think that's it.

846
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,357
That's not what he had in mind.

847
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,188
-What's he talking about, then?
-Ask him.

848
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,235
What's up, Shane?

849
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,314
You're playing...

850
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,032
...and you think everything is going fine.
But then one thing goes wrong...

851
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,275
...and another...

852
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,714
...and another.

853
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,317
You try to fight back, but the harder
you fight, the deeper you sink.

854
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,439
Until you can't move.

855
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,679
You can't breathe...

856
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,316
...because you're in over your head...

857
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,394
...like quicksand.

858
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,477
That's some deep shit.

859
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,752
Anything else you're afraid of?

860
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,675
-Going back to the mini-mart.
-The shipping yard.

861
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,988
The auto plant.

862
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,715
Prison.

863
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,953
Yeah, all right.

864
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,194
The truth is,
you guys have been given something...

865
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,231
