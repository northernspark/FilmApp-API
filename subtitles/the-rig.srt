THE RIG (2010)

Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

3
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:34,875
Coming through 4000'

4
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:37,281
…at 30' per minute.

5
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:39,842
Copy, 4000 at 30.

6
00:00:41,722 --> 00:00:43,883
Have you got the pipe?

7
00:00:43,924 --> 00:00:46,518
Almost.
Current's really rough down there.

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,051
Oh well, maybe you need
your brother to come do it for you.

9
00:00:49,096 --> 00:00:51,394
Very funny.

10
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,697
Boy, if I miss this

11
00:00:54,735 --> 00:00:57,431
because you can't get through
that thing, it is gonna be your arse.

12
00:00:57,471 --> 00:01:01,271
I'm on it.
Slow to 15. We're almost there.

13
00:01:01,308 --> 00:01:03,776
Copy that.
Slowing to 15.

14
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,335
The location looks perfect.

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,042
10', 8'--

16
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:10,606
slow slow--

17
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,086
six, four,

18
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:17,852
two, one,

19
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:19,916
and contact.

20
00:01:21,261 --> 00:01:23,957
Attaboy.
The pressure's in the green.

21
00:01:23,997 --> 00:01:25,464
Looks good here too.

22
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:29,367
Aye, temperature, pressure,
head speed-- it's all within limits.

23
00:01:29,403 --> 00:01:32,167
The storm's really
picking up.

24
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:34,036
Jim's gonna make me evacuate.

25
00:01:34,074 --> 00:01:36,065
Well, you know
the rules, man--

26
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:38,407
women and children first.

27
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,751
Oh, the seabed's venting.
Looks like we got a blowout.

28
00:01:46,787 --> 00:01:50,382
No no, it's a new hole, Colin.
They vent all the time.

29
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:52,688
No, this is different.

30
00:01:52,726 --> 00:01:55,627
And it's pushing the unit
all over the place.

31
00:01:55,662 --> 00:01:58,495
Well, are you still on it?

32
00:01:58,532 --> 00:02:01,968
Yeah, but it--

33
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:04,368
it looks purple.

34
00:02:04,404 --> 00:02:06,395
Purple?

35
00:02:08,742 --> 00:02:11,006
I'm off it.
Hang on.

36
00:02:13,346 --> 00:02:15,337
Something just hit
the ROV.

37
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:20,116
Aw, I just lost the light.

38
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:23,954
Okay, we've got another vent.

39
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,458
And it's glowing.

40
00:02:26,493 --> 00:02:28,188
What's glowing?

41
00:02:28,228 --> 00:02:30,355
The venting is glowing.

42
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:32,661
The light is out
and I can still see.

43
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:35,327
And it's pooling
around the wellhead.

44
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:38,734
Hang on.
I'm gonna recycle the light.

45
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:44,137
Whoa, something just hit the--

46
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:46,168
I just lost the feed.

47
00:02:46,213 --> 00:02:48,147
Great.
You just hit a fish

48
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:50,615
and broke a quarter-million-dollar
submersible.

49
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:02,487
Mr. Fleming, sir,

50
00:03:02,529 --> 00:03:05,020
I just got an update
from the National Weather Service.

51
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:07,158
They've upgraded the storm again.
It's getting worse.

52
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:23,973
Freddy.

53
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:26,577
All right, I need a list of all the rigs
directly in the path of the storm.

54
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,315
- Got it.
- Send out an emergency alert

55
00:03:28,355 --> 00:03:31,449
to all affected rig OIMs. And I want
all handies evacuated by dark.

56
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:33,959
Freddy, I need to talk to you.

57
00:03:33,994 --> 00:03:37,054
Yeah, I heard you, but unless
the rig's on fire and about to explode,

58
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:38,860
it's gonna have to wait
till I finish this.

59
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:40,127
I just need a minute.

60
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,634
Look, this is my job, all right?
Now let me finish my job

61
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:45,297
and then we can talk about
whatever it is you want to talk about.

62
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:46,965
Fine.

63
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:48,770
Sir, the only rig
that we have

64
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:51,038
that's in the direct path of the storm
is the Charlie rig.

65
00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:53,045
Then let's evacuate them first,
but all other rigs

66
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,479
within 100 miles on either side of the
storm evacuated as well.

67
00:03:55,515 --> 00:03:58,507
And tell everyone
who stays back on those rigs

68
00:03:58,552 --> 00:04:00,850
to button down.
It's gonna be a rough night.

69
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:02,101
Colin, I think everything's
gonna fit in there.

70
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:04,133
What do you want?

71
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:07,340
Uh, you wanted to talk to me,
remember?

72
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,314
It's too late.

73
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:11,317
Come on, what's up?

74
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:13,376
Nothing. Forget it.

75
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:17,018
Is this about you
getting pulled off the rig?

76
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,950
I'll talk to Jim
if you want me to,

77
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:25,294
but he's just gonna tell you
the same thing--

78
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:29,893
all non-essential crew get pulled
during a storm like this.

79
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:33,201
Maybe instead of getting
bent out of shape

80
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:36,606
you should just work
on being more essential.

81
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:38,474
It's not just that, Freddy.

82
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,877
I'm tired of being the baby.

83
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:44,873
I don't know if you've looked
at that little patch of pubes

84
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:48,445
on your chin recently or not,
but you are the baby on the rig.

85
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:50,479
That's not what I mean.

86
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:52,616
Everybody here knows you.

87
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:55,025
They know me
as the little Brewer.

88
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:58,292
- What do you want me to do about it?
- Nothing.

89
00:06:58,331 --> 00:07:01,767
As long as we're both on this rig, I'm
always gonna be living in your shadow.

90
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:03,393
And that's not gonna change.

91
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:05,131
Is that what you're
so pissed off about?

92
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:07,162
Yeah, it is.

93
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:10,074
When I get back to company base,
I'm gonna talk to Ken Fleming

94
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,771
and I'm getting off this rig.

95
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:13,802
If that's what you want,
I'm not gonna stop you.

96
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:16,042
Yeah, it is.

97
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:31,992
You know what Dad once told me
about family?

98
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:33,692
What?

99
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:39,138
He said,
''Other things may change

100
00:07:39,172 --> 00:07:43,131
but we start
and we end with family.''

101
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:30,655
I'm still waiting
on those wind speeds.

102
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,715
It's coming, man.
Keep your skirt on.

103
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,750
Kilt. I don't have to
take that from you.

104
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:38,628
You're nothing but a freaking postie.
And I don't take crap from posties.

105
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:41,327
What the hell is a postie?

106
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:44,200
''Thriller,'' the greatest album
of all time,

107
00:08:44,237 --> 00:08:46,501
was released
in December of 1982.

108
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:49,667
Therefore anyone born after that date
is considered post-''Thriller''

109
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:53,270
or a postie and is too young
to be capable of giving me crap.

110
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:56,510
Man, first of all,
what do you know about good music?

111
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:59,074
Don't you guys listen
to bagpipe music?

112
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:06,924
Andrew, give me
some numbers.

113
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,326
Wind speeds are holding up
at 95mph.

114
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:11,626
Mainland's saying we should be through
the worst of this by the morning.

115
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:13,529
Assuming we'll make it
through the night.

116
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:15,761
- Make it through the night?

117
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:18,566
Relax, kid. I've been through
100 storms worst than this one.

118
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:22,063
You think if there was any real danger,
I'd let Carey stay onboard?

119
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:26,010
When I send her home before a storm,
that's when it's time to worry.

120
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:29,208
Yeah, well, I was raised riding out
storms on wildcat platforms like this.

121
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:32,446
Yeah, and they all had the same name--
Hurricane Sarah.

122
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:36,455
Mom is a little more
of a tropical depression.

123
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:38,787
Yeah, it was depressing
all right.

124
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:40,349
I haven't said it to her yet.

125
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:42,884
But you want to, right?

126
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:48,528
I've never said it
to anyone before.

127
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:50,263
That's better than me.

128
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:52,828
I said it to every girl
I ever went to bed with.

129
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,831
Yeah, but did you mean it?

130
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,742
Once. But I married
that baby.

131
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,015
Wallace, why is
the compressor still on?

132
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,677
Uh, I don't know.

133
00:10:05,718 --> 00:10:08,710
So we're still pumping
Tabasco sauce into the rock.

134
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:11,121
Give me Dobbs on the horn.

135
00:10:14,494 --> 00:10:15,825
Compressor room.

136
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:19,593
Hey Dobbs, why is
the logging unit still on?

137
00:10:19,632 --> 00:10:21,122
The logging unit?

138
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:23,397
Sorry, Jim.
That's my fault.

139
00:10:23,436 --> 00:10:25,802
Well, you mind taking care of that
for me right now, please?

140
00:10:25,838 --> 00:10:27,806
I really don't feel like having
a blowout tonight.

141
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,365
Yeah, I'll get on it.

142
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,709
I'm sorry, Dobbs.
Thanks for covering for me.

143
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:36,010
Look, you stay here
and do the trial work.

144
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:37,880
And I'll go outside
and take care of it.

145
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:40,511
Hold on, let me finish this up.
I'll go with you.

146
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:49,895
Rodriguez, do you copy?

147
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,289
Hold on one sec.

148
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:55,995
Let's go already.

149
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:58,230
If you don't like how I do this,
you can come down here

150
00:10:58,271 --> 00:11:00,330
- and do it your goddamn self.

151
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:04,505
Here's what's left
of the camera.

152
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:06,535
Oh.

153
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:10,538
Yo, Dobbs,
the camera's fucking toast.

154
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:14,382
All right, tell Carey
and head back up.

155
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:35,430
What the hell is that?

156
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:37,868
It's fresh poached salmon.

157
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:40,702
I've got a tangy coconut, corlander
and chili sauce,

158
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,208
fresh asparagus,
fresh potatoes.

159
00:12:45,745 --> 00:12:48,805
I'll have a burger, burnt.

160
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:53,843
Well, I prepared
fresh poached salmon

161
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:56,548
with a tangy coconut, corlander
and chili sauce,

162
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:59,922
with fresh asparagus
and fresh potatoes.

163
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:03,919
Virgil, you rock.

164
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:06,431
Okay, so navy boy likes it.

165
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:08,161
Army.

166
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:10,192
Special forces.

167
00:13:10,236 --> 00:13:12,966
You wouldn't believe
the things I've had to eat.

168
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:15,405
You got a ham sandwich
back there, right?

169
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,513
- What's for dinner?
- Some kind of fish, I think.

170
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:25,517
Everything secure
on the starboard side?

171
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:28,577
The camera was torn apart,

172
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:31,283
but I found this

173
00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:34,316
in the casing.

174
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:37,759
Earl already
come through here?

175
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:39,287
No. Wasn't he with you?

176
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:49,536
Control room.

177
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:52,169
No, he hasn't been
down here.

178
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:54,202
Yeah, I'll let you know
if I hear from him.

179
00:13:54,247 --> 00:13:56,044
All right. Bye.

180
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:58,073
Who was that?

181
00:13:58,117 --> 00:14:00,108
- Dobbs.
- What did he want?

182
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:01,711
Just wanted to know
if we'd seen Earl,

183
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:03,813
said he hasn't come down
from the logging unit yet,

184
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:05,414
wondered if we'd heard
from him.

185
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,483
The compressor's still on.
Where is he now?

186
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:10,155
He's in the galley.

187
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:13,662
Dad.

188
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:22,900
My father's coming to you.

189
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:24,967
I'm sorry.

190
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:31,606
What's wrong?

191
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:34,677
- Jim's coming up here, isn't he?
- Yeah.

192
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,915
I don't care what he says.
I'm hungry.

193
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:39,652
And I haven't eaten all day.
I'm finishing my food today.

194
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:42,024
You'd better eat fast.

195
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:44,052
Stop pacing.

196
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:46,894
You're just gonna get yourself
all worked up.

197
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:48,491
I'm already worked up.

198
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:50,525
Maybe he wouldn't be
so hard on you

199
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,471
if you weren't nailing
his only daughter.

200
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,030
Does everybody know
about me and Carey?

201
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,336
Yeah.

202
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,300
So I guess Jim knows?

203
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:01,677
That's a safe bet.

204
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:05,775
Where is Earl?

205
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:08,218
He went down to turn the compressor off.
He hasn't come back in yet.

206
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:10,245
You sent him
out there alone?

207
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:12,621
Why the hell
didn't you go with him?

208
00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:14,091
All right, that's it.

209
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:16,993
I want you and Rodriguez outside
right now looking for him.

210
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:19,964
The rest of you-- I want you
to scour this ship up and down.

211
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:22,661
That goes for you too, Virg.
Come on, let's go.

212
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:50,426
Earl.

213
00:15:50,463 --> 00:15:52,363
Yo.

214
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:54,389
Are you in here, man?

215
00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:57,902
Earl.

216
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:04,101
Yo, Earl.

217
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:06,839
Oh, whoa whoa,

218
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,370
what have we here?

219
00:16:14,754 --> 00:16:17,314
Jesus, Earl.

220
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:20,482
Nice.

221
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:43,214
Nothing yet.

222
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:49,118
We're gonna go check
the logging unit.

223
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:10,632
Earl. Earl.

224
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:15,440
Earl?

225
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:20,811
Earl.

226
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:42,731
Earl, are you back here?

227
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,360
You were scared, eh?

228
00:18:38,898 --> 00:18:40,195
It's not funny.

229
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:42,792
Hey, it's payback
for the ham sandwiches.

230
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:47,662
Man...

231
00:18:47,706 --> 00:18:50,140
wait till I tell everybody
about this.

232
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,070
The logging unit
was never shut down.

233
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:23,499
He never made it that far.

234
00:19:25,644 --> 00:19:27,908
Meet me in my office.

235
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:56,638
Hello.

236
00:19:56,675 --> 00:19:59,109
- Hey, Colin, it's me.
- Hey.

237
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:01,476
Hey.

238
00:20:01,514 --> 00:20:04,574
I just wanted to make sure
you got to the operations center okay.

239
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:07,211
Yeah, I'm fine.

240
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:12,253
I thought about
what you said earlier and...

241
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,657
do you really want
off the rig?

242
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:19,458
Yeah, I'm gonna talk to Mr. Fleming
about it in a few minutes.

243
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,000
All right.

244
00:20:24,036 --> 00:20:26,504
For what it's worth,

245
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:29,633
I'm sorry that things didn't
work out the way we'd hoped.

246
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:34,777
If you really want to do this

247
00:20:34,813 --> 00:20:37,281
I guess I understand.

248
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:45,412
Colin, you're my
little brother, okay?

249
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:47,550
You're my responsibility.

250
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:55,492
If I was driving you nuts...

251
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,895
...it's just because
I Iove you.

252
00:20:59,939 --> 00:21:01,930
Freddy?

253
00:21:03,075 --> 00:21:05,475
Colin?

254
00:21:07,846 --> 00:21:10,542
Colin, are you there?

255
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:14,477
God damn it.

256
00:21:16,722 --> 00:21:19,213
- Copy?
- I've got nothing over here.

257
00:21:19,258 --> 00:21:21,886
Man, nothing over here too.

258
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:23,690
We lost comms.

259
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:26,698
Well, we knew that was a possibility.
No need to panic.

260
00:21:26,732 --> 00:21:29,826
- Famous last words.
- You pansy.

261
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:32,894
All right, well, I'm gonna go check
the eco report from the new satellite.

262
00:21:32,938 --> 00:21:35,338
So if anything else comes up,
you guys let me know.

263
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:36,636
Will do.

264
00:21:48,687 --> 00:21:50,678
Have a seat.

265
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:58,553
We lost contact
with the mainland.

266
00:21:58,597 --> 00:22:01,498
So we're not gonna be able get any help
looking for Earl

267
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:04,058
until after the storm passes.

268
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:09,333
I want you to take a look
at this.

269
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,366
What is it?

270
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,401
It's a letter I had to send

271
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:16,039
to the family of a good man
I lost nine years ago.

272
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:20,040
You ever have to send
a letter like that?

273
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:24,482
You ever met
Earl's wife Jeannie?

274
00:22:24,523 --> 00:22:27,617
A hell of a woman.

275
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:31,460
He's got a daughter Sophia.

276
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:33,522
She's 1 2 years old,

277
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:35,533
a beautiful child,
smart as a whip.

278
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:37,125
What do you want me to say?

279
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:39,637
I want you to understand

280
00:22:39,672 --> 00:22:42,766
that when you lead people
in a place like this

281
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:46,300
that your actions and decisions
can have long-ranging repercussions

282
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:49,644
that can affect the lives of people
you never even met before.

283
00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:52,310
Now we've got rules and protocol
for a reason.

284
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:54,615
And when you break 'em,
I gotta write letters like this

285
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:57,884
to little girls who are gonna
grow up without a daddy.

286
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:03,120
You need to start taking
responsibility seriously, son.

287
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:06,325
Now go on,
get the hell out of my office.

288
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,505
- Oh.
- Yeah.

289
00:23:53,545 --> 00:23:55,877
Thanks, man.
Oh, that's wonderful.

290
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:57,142
Mm-hmm.

291
00:23:57,182 --> 00:23:58,979
And I can open
a freaking window in here.

292
00:23:59,017 --> 00:24:01,247
I know. Smells like kangaroo pouch.
It's pretty bad.

293
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:03,277
It's about to get worse too.

294
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:05,483
Aren't you a bit old
to be reading comic books?

295
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:08,118
You know what? First off,
they're not comic books, okay?

296
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,425
Pay attention. These are graphic
novels. They're a little different.

297
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:13,328
And no, I'm not.

298
00:24:13,365 --> 00:24:14,992
I'll be back in five.

299
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:17,627
Hey, take your time, man.
You don't want to rush with that.

300
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:22,126
Come in.

301
00:25:24,336 --> 00:25:26,201
Hey.

302
00:25:30,943 --> 00:25:33,434
I don't think your father
likes me very much.

303
00:25:36,515 --> 00:25:40,781
Yeah, I know he can be
a little direct.

304
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:42,343
Yeah.

305
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:46,182
You find out what happened
to that camera?

306
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:48,090
No.

307
00:25:48,126 --> 00:25:50,651
Everything turn out all right
with the eco report?

308
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:54,789
Yeah, we're clean.

309
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,824
It's just--

310
00:25:56,869 --> 00:25:59,531
I don't know, these readings
don't make any sense.

311
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:02,404
So we're drilling
in a bad area?

312
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:04,841
The equipment's
working correctly,

313
00:26:04,877 --> 00:26:07,368
but it's bringing back this--

314
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:11,211
yeah, I don't know.

315
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:14,408
Right.

316
00:26:15,654 --> 00:26:17,645
One more thing.

317
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:56,253
Come on, come on.

318
00:26:56,295 --> 00:26:58,422
Baby.

319
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,392
Nice nice.

320
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,041
Yeah, Papi.

321
00:27:16,748 --> 00:27:19,182
Come on, Papi.

322
00:27:19,217 --> 00:27:21,242
Give it to me hard.

323
00:27:22,654 --> 00:27:25,248
Yeah.

324
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:36,089
Come in.

325
00:27:36,134 --> 00:27:39,194
Mr. Fleming, can I talk to you
for a minute?

326
00:27:39,237 --> 00:27:41,398
Yeah, but make it quick.

327
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,069
I'm Colin Brewer,
information systems on Charlie rig.

328
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,840
I was gonna see--

329
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:50,507
I was hoping to get assigned
to another rig.

330
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:54,251
You want to get off Jim's rig?

331
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:56,345
Yes, sir.

332
00:27:56,388 --> 00:27:58,754
That's gotta be a first.

333
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:01,516
Sit down.

334
00:28:02,961 --> 00:28:05,725
I've got a list of people
trying to get on that rig

335
00:28:05,764 --> 00:28:08,358
and you want to get off it?
Why?

336
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,426
Well, it has nothing to do
with the way Jim runs his rig.

337
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,768
It's more family-related.

338
00:28:13,805 --> 00:28:15,796
What did you say
your last name was?

339
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:18,036
- Brewer.
- Related to Fred Brewer?

340
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:20,067
Yeah, Freddy's my brother.

341
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:21,977
I know Freddy.
He's a good man.

342
00:28:22,014 --> 00:28:25,074
Jim speaks
very highly of him.

343
00:28:25,117 --> 00:28:27,017
If you're half as valuable
as Fred,

344
00:28:27,052 --> 00:28:29,850
well, Jim's gonna be very
disappointed to see you go.

345
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:32,948
Colin, right?

346
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:35,357
I understand something about

347
00:28:35,394 --> 00:28:37,794
working with family.

348
00:28:39,064 --> 00:28:41,862
So I want you to sleep on it.

349
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,630
And if you feel the same way
tomorrow,

350
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:46,466
we'll talk about it then.
Deal?

351
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:48,496
- Deal.
- Get out of here.

352
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,565
Thank you, sir.

353
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:55,680
I'm sorry about Earl.

354
00:28:55,714 --> 00:28:58,148
Me too.

355
00:28:59,317 --> 00:29:01,717
We work in a dangerous place.

356
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:04,846
I know.

357
00:29:12,164 --> 00:29:15,327
So I guess there's not much I can say
to make you feel better.

358
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:19,632
No.

359
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:21,662
Hmm.

360
00:29:24,976 --> 00:29:29,538
Mm, you smell like a roughneck.

361
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:31,572
I am a roughneck.

362
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:33,277
I know.

363
00:29:33,318 --> 00:29:35,252
I like it.

364
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,618
Carey, open up.
I need to talk to you for a minute.

365
00:30:11,656 --> 00:30:14,056
Dad, hang on a second.

366
00:30:19,865 --> 00:30:21,594
Who were you just talking to?

367
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:24,158
No one.

368
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:27,569
Wait, Dad.

369
00:30:30,642 --> 00:30:33,975
- He knows?
- Yeah. I gotta go talk to him.

370
00:30:43,288 --> 00:30:45,415
Excuse me,

371
00:30:45,457 --> 00:30:47,687
do you think you're done
with your workout?

372
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:50,490
I'm just taking a breather.

373
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:52,554
You'd better be.

374
00:31:00,138 --> 00:31:02,732
Dad, you can't possibly be upset.
You knew about us.

375
00:31:02,774 --> 00:31:04,765
Sweetheart, I'm your father.

376
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:07,141
I've got every right
to be upset.

377
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:10,444
I think I'm capable
of making my own choices.

378
00:31:10,482 --> 00:31:12,780
I know that.

379
00:31:12,817 --> 00:31:16,116
Look, it's just that--

380
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:18,213
What?

381
00:31:18,256 --> 00:31:21,350
I want something more
for you than this.

382
00:31:24,362 --> 00:31:27,126
Is this where you tell me that no man
is good enough for his daughter?

383
00:31:27,165 --> 00:31:29,827
Oh no, there is a man out there
who's good enough for you,

384
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:31,859
- but it's just not him.
- He's a good guy.

385
00:31:31,903 --> 00:31:36,237
I know that. Sweetheart,
this has nothing to do with him.

386
00:31:46,551 --> 00:31:48,542
How are you holding up?

387
00:31:48,587 --> 00:31:50,578
I'm all right.

388
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:52,351
That bad, huh?

389
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:59,188
I've been around, Dobbs.

390
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:01,222
Things happen.

391
00:32:01,266 --> 00:32:02,824
You're not supposed
to like 'em.

392
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:05,233
I know.

393
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:12,168
One time in the Philippines

394
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,201
we were supposed to free up

395
00:32:14,246 --> 00:32:17,306
a group of American
and British hostages.

396
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:19,749
As we were advancing,

397
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:22,184
one of our guys
took a bullet to the head--

398
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,654
killed him instantly,

399
00:32:24,689 --> 00:32:27,522
a lucky shot really.

400
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:30,153
He was my friend.

401
00:32:30,195 --> 00:32:32,186
One moment he's just moving
ahead of me,

402
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:36,530
the next moment
he's gone forever.

403
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:42,638
We're not at war, Faulkner.

404
00:32:42,674 --> 00:32:46,041
It's an oil rig. It's just a job.

405
00:32:46,077 --> 00:32:50,810
See, that's not the point.

406
00:32:50,849 --> 00:32:53,875
Bad things will happen to you

407
00:32:53,918 --> 00:32:56,250
in your life.

408
00:32:56,288 --> 00:32:58,279
It is how you respond to them

409
00:32:58,323 --> 00:33:00,985
that's going to determine
your character

410
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:03,256
from the day you're born

411
00:33:03,295 --> 00:33:07,527
till the day you die.

412
00:33:07,565 --> 00:33:09,590
But that doesn't make it
any easier.

413
00:33:09,634 --> 00:33:12,102
It never does.

414
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,267
You're a good person, Dobbs,

415
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:20,244
with a lot of potential.

416
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:23,441
If I didn't think so,
I wouldn't be wasting my breath on you.

417
00:33:25,016 --> 00:33:27,416
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

418
00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:35,052
Are you gonna read that book all night
or do you want to play some cards?

419
00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:39,127
Now, see, I want to take
your money.

420
00:33:41,366 --> 00:33:43,926
I want more for you than to end up
the wife of an oilman.

421
00:33:43,968 --> 00:33:45,959
This is a hard life.

422
00:33:46,004 --> 00:33:47,995
We're away for weeks
at a time.

423
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:51,497
It's hell on a woman.
Look what it did to my marriage.

424
00:33:51,543 --> 00:33:53,534
Okay, no, first of all,
I'm not Mom.

425
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:57,674
And second, there's a long way to go
for me to get married.

426
00:33:57,716 --> 00:33:59,843
Good.

427
00:33:59,884 --> 00:34:02,114
Dad.

428
00:34:02,153 --> 00:34:06,180
Honey, I'm just trying
to give you some advice

429
00:34:06,224 --> 00:34:08,886
and a few things
that I learned in this life.

430
00:34:08,927 --> 00:34:11,919
I mean, that's what fathers
are supposed to do.

431
00:34:11,963 --> 00:34:14,227
You've got a bright future
ahead of you

432
00:34:14,265 --> 00:34:16,597
and I want you to make
the most of it.

433
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:21,664
I know you do.

434
00:34:21,706 --> 00:34:23,697
And one other thing--

435
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:26,142
when you see Dobbs--

436
00:34:26,177 --> 00:34:29,169
this rig is like my house.

437
00:34:29,214 --> 00:34:31,580
What goes on here
goes on under my roof.

438
00:34:31,616 --> 00:34:34,176
And you two need
to respect that.

439
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:36,710
Of course I do.

440
00:34:37,822 --> 00:34:40,290
Get over here,
you doe-eyed smartass.

441
00:34:42,794 --> 00:34:45,058
Go on, take a walk.
I'm busy.

442
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:48,395
All right.
I love you, Dad.

443
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:50,867
I love you too, baby.

444
00:35:21,399 --> 00:35:23,993
I assume you took care of everything
and he loves me now.

445
00:35:24,035 --> 00:35:25,525
Not quite.

446
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:28,562
I'm his daughter. This is his rig.
What do you expect?

447
00:35:28,606 --> 00:35:31,040
See, that's a good girlfriend--
getting us some brownies.

448
00:35:31,075 --> 00:35:32,633
Aw, honey.

449
00:35:32,677 --> 00:35:35,145
They're not for you.

450
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,308
Oh, how did you get
so many kings?

451
00:35:39,784 --> 00:35:42,184
I fold.

452
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,814
- Having fun?
- Mm-hmm.

453
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:49,984
I hate this game.

454
00:36:04,075 --> 00:36:05,975
Dad.

455
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:16,986
Help me!
Kyle, please help! Help!

456
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:18,750
Help! It's my dad.

457
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,020
- Where is he?
- In his office.

458
00:36:25,296 --> 00:36:28,925
- The window.
- Please. Please.

459
00:36:28,967 --> 00:36:30,992
Let's get her out of here.

460
00:37:16,314 --> 00:37:19,306
Do you think this has
something to do with Earl?

461
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,046
I think it definitely has something
to do with Earl.

462
00:37:52,684 --> 00:37:55,949
I'll call the crew up.

463
00:37:58,289 --> 00:38:00,280
Sweetheart, I'm your father.

464
00:38:00,325 --> 00:38:01,849
I've got every right
to be upset.

465
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:06,062
I think I'm capable of making
my own choices.

466
00:38:06,097 --> 00:38:08,156
No, first of all,
I'm not Mom.

467
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:12,761
- Where is he? Where is he?
- Come on.

468
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:39,258
No one's answering
from the control room.

469
00:38:39,297 --> 00:38:40,730
Try the gym.

470
00:38:49,007 --> 00:38:50,304
No one's answering.

471
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:54,071
I'll try the galley.

472
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:36,240
Then where is everybody?

473
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,542
I don't know.

474
00:40:37,582 --> 00:40:39,573
Well, we have to go
check the rig.

475
00:40:43,087 --> 00:40:46,784
We're going to search the rig,
make sure everybody else is okay.

476
00:40:46,824 --> 00:40:48,815
Take whatever you can
as a weapon.

477
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,919
You don't know
who we'll be meeting out there.

478
00:41:03,341 --> 00:41:05,002
Let's go.

479
00:41:41,312 --> 00:41:43,177
Hey.

480
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:48,780
- You got a problem?
- What's with the lamp?

481
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,720
What have you guys
been doing?

482
00:41:50,755 --> 00:41:53,588
-
- Exercising.

483
00:41:56,928 --> 00:41:59,726
What's wrong with you guys?

484
00:41:59,764 --> 00:42:01,493
How long have you guys
been here?

485
00:42:01,532 --> 00:42:03,762
I don't know.
An hour and a half,

486
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:06,702
two hours.

487
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:08,637
We think Jim is dead.

488
00:42:08,673 --> 00:42:10,937
You think?

489
00:42:10,975 --> 00:42:12,374
It looks like
someone killed him.

490
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,401
What do you mean,
someone killed him?

491
00:42:14,445 --> 00:42:17,608
There's blood all over his office and
the blood trail leads out the window.

492
00:42:17,648 --> 00:42:21,084
If you guys are pulling
some kind of joke, this isn't funny.

493
00:42:21,118 --> 00:42:23,313
No, it's not a joke.

494
00:42:23,354 --> 00:42:25,345
What did the mainland say?

495
00:42:25,389 --> 00:42:26,822
The radio is out.

496
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:28,849
We're gonna go
to the control room next.

497
00:42:28,893 --> 00:42:30,758
Well, we're not doing
any good here.

498
00:42:53,718 --> 00:42:56,050
Jesus.

499
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,124
It's just like Jim's office.

500
00:43:08,065 --> 00:43:10,693
Help me over here.
Something's blocking the door.

501
00:43:24,815 --> 00:43:27,045
- Andrew.
- Freddy?

502
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:28,881
What the hell
are you doing?

503
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,515
Oh man, I'm sorry, dude.
I didn't know that was you.

504
00:43:32,556 --> 00:43:35,320
A life vest? really?

505
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,849
It was all I had.

506
00:43:40,131 --> 00:43:42,326
What?

507
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:45,428
Did you guys
kill that thing?

508
00:43:45,469 --> 00:43:47,460
What thing?
What the hell are you talking about?

509
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:49,530
The thing, man.
I saw it kill Wallace.

510
00:43:49,573 --> 00:43:52,770
I've never seen
anything like it before, man.

511
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,142
It had claws.

512
00:43:55,179 --> 00:43:57,511
It kind of looked like
the Mexican chupa thing.

513
00:43:57,548 --> 00:43:59,413
You know, the Mexican thing.

514
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,247
I'm Puerto Rican, asshole.

515
00:44:01,285 --> 00:44:04,254
Okay, whatever it was,
it was fierce.

516
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,621
It tore Wallace apart.

517
00:44:07,658 --> 00:44:09,216
Why didn't it get you?

518
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,251
Because I ran.

519
00:44:11,295 --> 00:44:13,661
I dived into here.
I just barely got away.

520
00:44:13,698 --> 00:44:14,960
Where did it go?

521
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:16,557
I don't know.

522
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,761
We have a security camera.

523
00:44:18,803 --> 00:44:20,862
Maybe we can see it
on one of those.

524
00:44:41,158 --> 00:44:43,149
Wait.

525
00:44:43,194 --> 00:44:46,163
There, the lower
right-hand corner.

526
00:44:46,197 --> 00:44:47,630
I don't see shit.

527
00:44:47,665 --> 00:44:50,725
Try another camera.
Maybe we'll get a better image.

528
00:44:50,768 --> 00:44:53,066
This is camera C,

529
00:44:53,104 --> 00:44:56,540
portside aft corner,
at roughly the same time.

530
00:44:59,477 --> 00:45:01,377
That's it.
That's what I saw.

531
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:03,403
What the hell is that thing?

532
00:45:03,447 --> 00:45:05,415
I told you guys.

533
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:07,849
When is the rest of the crew
coming back?

534
00:45:07,885 --> 00:45:09,876
When the storm ends.

535
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,649
Well, the weather service said

536
00:45:11,689 --> 00:45:13,919
that the storm should
pass through by morning.

537
00:45:16,027 --> 00:45:18,621
Maybe that thing
will just go away.

538
00:45:21,732 --> 00:45:24,826
Obviously we didn't
bring it out here with us.

539
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:27,303
- Well, then what the hell is it?
- Does it matter?

540
00:45:27,338 --> 00:45:29,363
He's right.

541
00:45:29,407 --> 00:45:31,932
How are we gonna kill
that thing?

542
00:45:31,976 --> 00:45:34,945
There's a speargun
next to the scuba gear.

543
00:45:34,979 --> 00:45:36,469
It'll have to do.

544
00:45:36,514 --> 00:45:38,482
No, my dad has a gun.

545
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:40,450
It was a gift from my uncle
when he got the rig.

546
00:45:40,484 --> 00:45:41,712
He keeps it in his state room.

547
00:45:41,752 --> 00:45:43,344
So let's go get it.

548
00:45:44,388 --> 00:45:46,822
Stick together, no straggiers.
I'll take the lead.

549
00:45:46,857 --> 00:45:48,848
Faulkner, you and Freddy
watch the rear.

550
00:45:48,893 --> 00:45:51,828
Hey hey, fuck you, no.
Women are not gonna be in the middle.

551
00:45:51,862 --> 00:45:53,523
No offense, Andrew.

552
00:45:53,564 --> 00:45:55,555
Whatever, man.
I don't mind being in the middle.

553
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,396
I'll take the lead.

554
00:45:57,435 --> 00:45:59,562
You cocksuckers
try and keep up.

555
00:46:28,065 --> 00:46:29,623
It's locked.

556
00:46:33,237 --> 00:46:34,932
This way.

557
00:47:08,939 --> 00:47:12,102
We need to keep moving.

558
00:47:20,651 --> 00:47:22,642
Where's the gun?

559
00:47:22,686 --> 00:47:25,018
It's in the box on the desk.

560
00:47:32,263 --> 00:47:34,754
Nice. What is that?

561
00:47:34,798 --> 00:47:37,198
A trigger lock.

562
00:47:37,234 --> 00:47:39,031
Great.

563
00:47:39,069 --> 00:47:41,970
It doesn't do us much good
like that.

564
00:47:43,574 --> 00:47:45,565
Check the desk.

565
00:47:49,813 --> 00:47:51,508
There's nothing here.

566
00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:53,449
Wait, it's probably
on his keychain.

567
00:47:53,484 --> 00:47:55,952
He always keeps it
on a hook in his office.

568
00:47:57,321 --> 00:47:59,346
Why don't you all
go up ahead?

569
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:01,119
I'm going to go get
that speargun.

570
00:48:01,158 --> 00:48:02,887
We need to stick together.

571
00:48:02,927 --> 00:48:05,862
No, I need to be
on my own.

572
00:48:07,431 --> 00:48:09,729
Look, I don't know
what this thing is,

573
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:12,235
but it's not here for food.

574
00:48:12,269 --> 00:48:14,737
It likes to kill us.

575
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:18,435
And it's doing it
one by one.

576
00:48:18,475 --> 00:48:20,909
Character, Dobbs.

577
00:48:22,012 --> 00:48:23,980
I hunt alone.

578
00:48:25,015 --> 00:48:27,313
Stick together.
Like he says,

579
00:48:27,351 --> 00:48:30,047
you're safer as a group.

580
00:48:33,524 --> 00:48:36,220
We can't worry about him.
We need that key.

581
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:39,718
Hey, instead of running around,
how about we just go to the control room

582
00:48:39,763 --> 00:48:41,355
and barricade ourselves in?

583
00:48:41,398 --> 00:48:44,492
We will, but we need
this gun for protection.

584
00:48:45,536 --> 00:48:48,300
Let's go.

585
00:49:00,351 --> 00:49:02,251
If we cut through here,
we'll get there faster.

586
00:49:02,286 --> 00:49:04,618
Let's do it.

587
00:50:06,817 --> 00:50:09,308
Gotcha.

588
00:51:02,973 --> 00:51:06,500
- Wait here.
- No no, I'm going in.

589
00:51:06,543 --> 00:51:08,238
Do you know
where he keeps them?

590
00:51:08,278 --> 00:51:11,338
The thing about my dad--

591
00:51:11,382 --> 00:51:13,509
a creature of habit.

592
00:51:29,767 --> 00:51:31,758
I love you, Dad.

593
00:51:31,802 --> 00:51:34,794
I love you too, baby.

594
00:51:57,528 --> 00:51:59,462
Got it.

595
00:51:59,496 --> 00:52:01,521
We gotta go.

596
00:52:07,271 --> 00:52:08,670
Are we good?

597
00:52:08,705 --> 00:52:11,538
Yeah, we're good.
We've still got to check in on Virgil.

598
00:52:11,575 --> 00:52:13,133
Hey man, why don't we just
go lock ourselves

599
00:52:13,177 --> 00:52:15,042
in the control room
like you said?

600
00:52:15,078 --> 00:52:17,603
You go wait in the control room.
We'll meet you there.

601
00:52:21,952 --> 00:52:23,943
Wait up.

602
00:53:10,767 --> 00:53:13,565
Rodriguez, Andrew, watch the front
while we search the place.

603
00:53:13,604 --> 00:53:15,094
Watch the front?

604
00:53:15,138 --> 00:53:16,969
Don't be such a sissy.

605
00:53:17,007 --> 00:53:19,032
Wait, at least
give me the gun.

606
00:53:58,482 --> 00:54:01,417
Listening to Dobbs
is gonna get us killed,

607
00:54:01,451 --> 00:54:03,919
I'm telling you.
Who elected him the leader?

608
00:54:03,954 --> 00:54:06,718
You're, like, the wussiest person
I've ever met.

609
00:54:23,106 --> 00:54:23,173
- Chicken.
- I'm not a chicken, okay?

610
00:54:23,173 --> 00:54:25,971
- Chicken.
- I'm not a chicken, okay?

611
00:54:26,009 --> 00:54:27,499
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

612
00:54:31,315 --> 00:54:33,408
What was that?

613
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:35,918
I don't know.

614
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:48,364
What are you doing?
Don't go down there.

615
00:54:48,398 --> 00:54:50,298
Shh.

616
00:54:50,334 --> 00:54:51,892
Stupid.

617
00:54:51,935 --> 00:54:55,427
You hear a noise, you're gonna
go down there and check on it?

618
00:54:57,007 --> 00:54:58,998
Fine. You're right.

619
00:54:59,042 --> 00:55:02,478
Of course I'm right. If anything,
you should be going away from the noise.

620
00:55:02,512 --> 00:55:04,537
Run!

621
00:55:04,581 --> 00:55:07,277
Run, Andrew! Run!

622
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:18,684
Help! Guys guys guys!

623
00:55:20,731 --> 00:55:22,221
It's out here!

624
00:55:24,534 --> 00:55:26,525
No.

625
00:55:55,699 --> 00:55:57,963
- Why didn't you help her?
- I tried.

626
00:55:58,001 --> 00:56:00,629
- You liar!
- I did. She told me to run.

627
00:56:00,671 --> 00:56:02,730
That's her blood.

628
00:56:02,773 --> 00:56:05,901
That's enough!
Come on, that's enough.

629
00:56:10,914 --> 00:56:12,677
You little shit.

630
00:56:12,716 --> 00:56:15,378
Whoa whoa,
where are you going?

631
00:56:15,419 --> 00:56:17,751
I'm gonna find this thing

632
00:56:17,788 --> 00:56:19,517
and I'm gonna kill it.

633
00:56:19,556 --> 00:56:21,285
Freddy, please.

634
00:56:38,408 --> 00:56:40,399
What the hell, man?

635
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:40,064
Easy.

636
00:57:40,103 --> 00:57:42,094
Over here.

637
00:57:42,139 --> 00:57:44,733
- Careful.
- It hurts, man. It hurts.

638
00:57:44,775 --> 00:57:46,800
- Easy.
- I got it. I got it.

639
00:57:50,313 --> 00:57:53,043
Here.

640
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,211
Hey.

641
00:57:59,256 --> 00:58:00,985
I'm sorry.

642
00:58:06,963 --> 00:58:08,521
Well, what do we do now?

643
00:58:08,565 --> 00:58:11,056
We sit here and wait.

644
00:58:11,101 --> 00:58:13,331
This thing's not gonna
leave us alone.

645
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:15,930
We're safer in here
than we are out there.

646
00:58:15,972 --> 00:58:18,736
He's not going anywhere
like that.

647
00:58:18,775 --> 00:58:21,107
I just don't like
being boxed in here like this.

648
00:58:21,144 --> 00:58:23,635
Guys.

649
00:58:26,149 --> 00:58:28,549
He's having an allergic reaction.

650
00:58:28,585 --> 00:58:31,315
We have to get him
an adrenalin shot now.

651
00:58:31,354 --> 00:58:33,584
In the sickbay?

652
00:58:33,623 --> 00:58:35,090
Yeah.

653
00:58:36,793 --> 00:58:38,488
Damn it.

654
00:58:38,528 --> 00:58:40,496
He's struggling to breathe.
If we don't--

655
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:43,158
I know.
I'll go get it.

656
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,361
I'll go with you.

657
00:58:45,402 --> 00:58:48,132
Well, I can get on the monitors
and watch for this thing.

658
00:58:50,841 --> 00:58:52,968
What about you guys in here?

659
00:58:53,009 --> 00:58:55,477
Take the gun.

660
00:58:55,512 --> 00:58:57,912
We'll be fine.

661
00:59:01,151 --> 00:59:03,119
We'll get you help, Andrew.

662
00:59:03,153 --> 00:59:05,144
Hang in there.

663
00:59:21,671 --> 00:59:23,434
We need to go under the rig.

664
00:59:23,473 --> 00:59:26,135
What?

665
00:59:26,176 --> 00:59:28,440
We need to go under the rig
to avoid this thing.

666
00:59:28,478 --> 00:59:30,537
It's longer,
but it's the safest way.

667
00:59:31,715 --> 00:59:34,843
Carey, we're going
under the rig.

668
00:59:34,885 --> 00:59:36,546
I don't have cameras
under there.

669
00:59:36,586 --> 00:59:38,076
I know.

670
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:22,551
Shh.

671
01:01:22,592 --> 01:01:25,720
Jeez, where have you been?

672
01:01:25,762 --> 01:01:27,127
You're being hunted.

673
01:01:28,665 --> 01:01:29,893
Keep moving.

674
01:01:59,462 --> 01:02:01,760
Okay, I've got it portside.
Stay out of that area.

675
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:54,839
There's another one.

676
01:03:54,878 --> 01:03:56,038
What?

677
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:58,309
There's two of them.
They got Faulkner.

678
01:04:18,868 --> 01:04:21,302
- Is this it?
- Yes yes.

679
01:04:44,427 --> 01:04:46,861
Give him the shot.

680
01:05:03,613 --> 01:05:05,843
Is he gonna be all right?

681
01:05:05,882 --> 01:05:07,873
I don't know.

682
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:23,694
You didn't happen to get
any bandages for his leg, did you?

683
01:05:25,535 --> 01:05:26,866
I thought I'd ask.

684
01:05:35,011 --> 01:05:36,672
What happened?

685
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,646
Easy.

686
01:05:43,953 --> 01:05:46,046
Get him up!

687
01:05:46,089 --> 01:05:47,818
Come on, come on.

688
01:05:49,626 --> 01:05:51,253
Okay, here we go.

689
01:05:53,396 --> 01:05:54,886
Move.

690
01:06:00,103 --> 01:06:02,765
Andrew.

691
01:06:02,805 --> 01:06:04,204
He's dead.

692
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,004
Shit. Okay.

693
01:06:23,426 --> 01:06:25,223
Here here.

694
01:06:25,261 --> 01:06:27,252
Come on, come on, come on.

695
01:06:27,297 --> 01:06:29,561
Shh. Shh.

696
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:15,678
- It's clear.
- Are you sure?

697
01:07:15,712 --> 01:07:18,112
It went over the side.

698
01:07:31,828 --> 01:07:34,422
- Do you think it's gone for good?
- I doubt it.

699
01:07:34,464 --> 01:07:37,331
What the hell
do we do now?

700
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:39,562
We gotta kill it.

701
01:07:41,838 --> 01:07:43,863
Or it's gonna kill us.

702
01:07:43,906 --> 01:07:45,498
How?

703
01:07:45,541 --> 01:07:48,704
I'm gonna wait up on the helicopter pad
with a bunch of pipes and knives.

704
01:07:48,745 --> 01:07:51,578
And when it comes, I'm gonna
go to town on that motherfucker.

705
01:07:51,614 --> 01:07:53,741
We could.

706
01:07:53,783 --> 01:07:55,774
But I doubt pipes and knives
are gonna do the trick.

707
01:07:55,818 --> 01:07:57,843
Well, aren't there some chemicals
or something we can use?

708
01:07:57,887 --> 01:07:59,946
This is an oil rig.
We gotta have something.

709
01:07:59,989 --> 01:08:02,651
A bunch of metal tools.
You want to throw wrenches at it?

710
01:08:02,692 --> 01:08:04,057
No. I don't know.

711
01:08:04,093 --> 01:08:06,084
What about natural gas?

712
01:08:06,129 --> 01:08:07,994
You want to blow the rig?

713
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:09,691
- I like it.
- No no no no.

714
01:08:09,732 --> 01:08:12,826
We pump gas into an area,
we lure the thing in there,

715
01:08:12,869 --> 01:08:14,837
and we burn it to a crisp.

716
01:08:14,871 --> 01:08:17,601
- Yeah, we can do that too.
- Yeah, I can get the rig online.

717
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,040
We can redirect the gas
to whatever line we want.

718
01:08:20,076 --> 01:08:21,976
- How long will that take?
- 15-20 minutes.

719
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:23,842
Good. Freddy,
we need some flare guns.

720
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,871
We have that
in the emergency kit.

721
01:08:25,915 --> 01:08:27,382
All right.

722
01:08:27,417 --> 01:08:29,146
How are we gonna
lure it there?

723
01:08:29,185 --> 01:08:31,653
One thing at a time.

724
01:08:31,687 --> 01:08:33,712
Let's get moving.

725
01:08:50,106 --> 01:08:52,097
Oh! Fucking--

726
01:08:52,141 --> 01:08:54,132
Fucker.

727
01:08:54,177 --> 01:08:56,236
Fuck you.

728
01:09:03,453 --> 01:09:05,717
No flare gun.
Found the flares.

729
01:09:05,755 --> 01:09:08,053
It'll have to do.

730
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,091
Be careful that doesn't
go off by accident.

731
01:09:13,529 --> 01:09:15,554
Good call.

732
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:23,261
How are we doing?

733
01:09:23,306 --> 01:09:24,933
almost there.

734
01:09:24,974 --> 01:09:27,374
So how are we gonna
lure it in?

735
01:09:28,845 --> 01:09:31,279
Well, I figured you and I

736
01:09:31,314 --> 01:09:33,782
keep watch on the drill deck.

737
01:09:33,816 --> 01:09:35,716
Carey, you watch the monitors.

738
01:09:35,751 --> 01:09:37,480
When we see this thing,

739
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,852
we use ourselves as bait.

740
01:09:39,889 --> 01:09:43,381
That's what I was afraid of.

741
01:09:43,426 --> 01:09:45,417
Okay.

742
01:09:47,396 --> 01:09:50,297
Kyle.

743
01:10:00,209 --> 01:10:02,234
I love you.

744
01:10:06,415 --> 01:10:08,815
I love you too.

745
01:10:16,526 --> 01:10:17,959
Good luck.

746
01:10:17,994 --> 01:10:19,791
Thanks. You too.

747
01:12:06,369 --> 01:12:09,930
I don't suppose we could hope
this thing gave up on us.

748
01:12:09,972 --> 01:12:11,997
I wouldn't count on it.

749
01:12:20,583 --> 01:12:21,709
Guys, I got something.

750
01:12:21,751 --> 01:12:22,979
What is it?

751
01:12:23,019 --> 01:12:24,884
Movement on
the northeast corner.

752
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,945
Freddy, that's you.

753
01:12:29,425 --> 01:12:30,722
I don't see anything.

754
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,524
It was just a shadow,
but it was definitely movement.

755
01:13:03,259 --> 01:13:05,159
I've got an idea.

756
01:14:08,057 --> 01:14:10,082
I'm gonna kill this thing.

757
01:14:10,126 --> 01:14:12,321
- Carey, what do you see?
- I don't know. I've lost it.

758
01:14:35,351 --> 01:14:36,579
Freddy!

759
01:14:38,287 --> 01:14:40,187
Freddy!

760
01:14:53,402 --> 01:14:55,836
Freddy!

761
01:15:08,584 --> 01:15:10,381
Carey, I'm coming to you.

762
01:15:10,419 --> 01:15:11,818
What?
Where's Freddy?

763
01:15:11,854 --> 01:15:14,379
He's gone. I'm coming to you,
and coming to you fast.

764
01:15:37,313 --> 01:15:39,304
Are you okay?

765
01:15:39,348 --> 01:15:42,146
Listen, we can still kill
this thing, all right?

766
01:15:42,184 --> 01:15:43,811
Yeah.

767
01:15:46,922 --> 01:15:48,617
We can do this.

768
01:15:48,657 --> 01:15:50,215
- Let's go.
- Uh-huh.

769
01:16:16,385 --> 01:16:17,647
Run!

770
01:18:11,133 --> 01:18:13,158
Oh shit.

771
01:19:09,992 --> 01:19:12,654
Charlie rig,
this is Weyland base command.

772
01:19:14,329 --> 01:19:16,820
Roger that. The weather is clear.
What's your ETA?

773
01:19:16,865 --> 01:19:18,662
- It's rescue 1-5.
- I'll take it.

774
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:22,227
Rescue 1-5,
this is Ken Fleming at base.

775
01:19:22,271 --> 01:19:24,262
Copy, Mr. Fleming.
This is 1-5.

776
01:19:24,306 --> 01:19:26,297
We're approaching
Charlie rig now.

777
01:19:28,343 --> 01:19:30,971
Do you see any of the crew?

778
01:19:31,013 --> 01:19:33,675
Sir, I've got one person
on the helipad.

779
01:19:33,715 --> 01:19:36,183
It's a female, Caucasian.

780
01:19:40,222 --> 01:19:42,247
Carey.

781
01:19:44,093 --> 01:19:46,357
Anyone else, 1-5?

782
01:19:59,208 --> 01:20:01,768
Sir, this is Rescue 1-5, copy.

783
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:03,539
Go ahead, 1-5.

784
01:20:03,579 --> 01:20:05,570
Sir--

785
01:20:05,614 --> 01:20:08,174
the girl is hysterical, sir.

786
01:20:08,217 --> 01:20:10,208
She's saying

787
01:20:10,252 --> 01:20:12,243
the crew is dead.

788
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:14,278
She says

789
01:20:14,323 --> 01:20:16,655
they're all gone.

790
01:20:20,395 --> 01:20:23,922
John, get her back here, okay?

791
01:20:23,966 --> 01:20:25,433
Okay.

792
01:20:25,467 --> 01:20:26,957
This is base.

793
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:04,064
The rig's systems are offline.

794
01:21:04,106 --> 01:21:06,233
It looks like a substantial blow.

795
01:21:06,275 --> 01:21:09,506
And as soon as everybody
gets on site, you call me.

796
01:21:09,545 --> 01:21:11,945
Colin, come in here.
John, excuse us.

797
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:14,608
What's going on?

798
01:21:14,650 --> 01:21:17,380
I gotta be straight
with you, son.

799
01:21:17,419 --> 01:21:20,513
We just got an automatic
emergency message from your rig.

800
01:21:44,713 --> 01:21:46,203
Colin, I'm sorry.

801
01:21:50,118 --> 01:21:52,143
I should have stayed.

802
01:21:52,187 --> 01:21:54,212
No.

803
01:21:54,256 --> 01:21:56,884
You did exactly what you were
supposed to do.

804
01:21:56,925 --> 01:22:00,156
Your brother did exactly
what he was supposed to do.

805
01:22:05,901 --> 01:22:09,132
I know these rigs.
And I know Jim.

806
01:22:09,171 --> 01:22:11,605
The storm did not cause
that explosion.

807
01:22:17,045 --> 01:22:19,104
That rig was blown
for another reason.

808
01:22:19,147 --> 01:22:21,377
- And I'm gonna go find out why.
- I'm going.

809
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:23,008
No, you're staying here.

810
01:22:24,853 --> 01:22:27,549
I have to go.

811
01:22:30,259 --> 01:22:33,023
I have to bring
my brother home.

812
01:24:52,467 --> 01:24:53,627
God.

813
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:10,775
Oh my God.

814
01:25:14,756 --> 01:25:16,553
Colin.

815
01:25:18,059 --> 01:25:19,617
Colin.

816
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:51,342
Freddy!

817
01:27:53,815 --> 01:27:56,113
Freddy.

818
01:27:59,521 --> 01:28:01,580
Colin!

819
01:28:06,328 --> 01:28:09,058
That's for my brother,
you ugly son of a bitch.

820
01:28:35,624 --> 01:28:38,718
Are you still looking
for that transfer?

821
01:28:40,061 --> 01:28:42,393
'Cause I'm coming with you.

822
01:28:43,305 --> 01:28:49,233
