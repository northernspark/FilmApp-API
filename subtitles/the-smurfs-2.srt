00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:48,119
<i>Time to smurf some magic.</i>

3
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,539
<i>Let's see.</i>

4
00:00:52,665 --> 00:00:54,209
<i>There you are.</i>

5
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:56,127
<i>Mimosa pollen.</i>

00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:02,217
<i>Yes, tiger lily</i>

7
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,637
<i>to make her essence magical and blue.</i>

8
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:10,308
<i>Unless this spell be all for naught,</i>

9
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:13,311
<i>the final thing, one hopeful thought.</i>

10
00:01:24,948 --> 00:01:28,409
<i>Once upon a time, in Smurf Village,</i>

11
00:01:28,493 --> 00:01:32,413
<i>happy Smurfs
were going about their happy lives</i>

12
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:36,584
<i>completely unaware that not too far away,</i>

13
00:01:36,668 --> 00:01:39,754
<i>the evil wizard Gargamel</i>

14
00:01:39,837 --> 00:01:43,508
was concocting a diabolical plan.

15
00:01:44,258 --> 00:01:45,510
Hey.

16
00:01:45,593 --> 00:01:46,928
Hey!

17
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:49,973
Smooth, you're upstaging the narrator.

18
00:01:50,056 --> 00:01:53,267
Yo, take it down a notch,
my blues brothers.

19
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:55,353
- All right. All right.
- Thank you. Anyway...

20
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,854
So Gargamel said,

21
00:01:57,021 --> 00:02:00,608
<i>"I am making my own irresistible creation,</i>

22
00:02:00,692 --> 00:02:06,197
<i>"the Smurfette, to infiltrate their village
and betray the Smurfs."</i>

23
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:22,797
Wow.

24
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,298
Not a good look on her.

25
00:02:24,382 --> 00:02:25,967
- She's a Frankensmurf?
- Yes.

26
00:02:26,718 --> 00:02:31,222
<i>And her naughty nature
took Smurf Village by storm.</i>

27
00:02:33,057 --> 00:02:35,601
<i>She even flooded our village.</i>

28
00:02:38,604 --> 00:02:41,065
<i>The Smurfs wanted her gone,</i>

29
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:46,237
<i>but even though she was Gargamel's
creation, Papa saw the good in her.</i>

30
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,492
<i>With love, kindness, a complete makeover,
and a secret magic formula,</i>

31
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:54,829
<i>he turned her into a true-blue Smurf,</i>

32
00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:59,584
and that is how
our darling Smurfette came to be.

33
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:03,755
- Hi.
- Holy moly.

34
00:03:03,838 --> 00:03:05,256
Hi, Smurfette.

35
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:09,594
I wish I had that hair.

36
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:15,683
- Nice dive, Smurfette.
- That was amazing.

37
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:16,726
Wow. Show-off.

38
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:17,852
Pretty!

39
00:03:17,935 --> 00:03:21,272
- That was so purty.
- Nice tuck and roll.

40
00:03:21,355 --> 00:03:23,066
- Hi!
- Like a beautiful mermaid.

41
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:25,902
Wait, how is her hair still dry?

42
00:03:29,447 --> 00:03:31,365
Oh, no.

43
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:32,992
What...

44
00:03:34,952 --> 00:03:38,122
Stupid, trusting Smurfs.

45
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:39,999
You're mine now.

46
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,001
- It's alive!
- Smurf for the hills!

47
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:43,836
Don't kill the narrator!

48
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:47,965
The world as we know it is over!

49
00:03:48,424 --> 00:03:50,009
She's got a Dragon Wand.

50
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:51,761
Don't hurt my cupcake!

51
00:03:51,844 --> 00:03:52,845
Look out!

52
00:03:56,224 --> 00:03:59,727
Yes! My beautiful creation.

53
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:03,106
You truly are daddy's little girl.

54
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,075
No...

55
00:04:15,243 --> 00:04:17,829
Smurfette, are you okay?

56
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,206
Oh, Papa.

57
00:04:20,873 --> 00:04:24,418
There, there. Everything's
going to be fine.

58
00:04:24,502 --> 00:04:26,504
Having that nightmare again?

59
00:04:27,004 --> 00:04:29,757
Papa, every year on my birthday,

60
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:32,844
I have these horrible dreams
about where I come from,

61
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:37,515
and it makes me wonder who I really am.

62
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:42,728
And every year, I remind you,
it doesn't matter where you came from.

63
00:04:42,812 --> 00:04:45,648
What matters is who you choose to be.

64
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:47,525
Really?

65
00:04:48,609 --> 00:04:51,154
Don't take this old Smurf's word for it.

66
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:53,698
Go out there and see for yourself.

67
00:04:53,781 --> 00:04:56,117
This is where you belong.

68
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,786
<i>You belong to Gargamel.</i>

69
00:04:59,787 --> 00:05:02,373
<i>You belong to Gargamel.</i>

70
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,085
"You belong to Gargamel." Say it.

71
00:05:07,128 --> 00:05:08,754
"You belong to Gargamel."

72
00:05:08,838 --> 00:05:10,131
"I, I."

73
00:05:10,214 --> 00:05:11,215
"I, I."

74
00:05:11,382 --> 00:05:14,302
You know what? Never mind, sir.
You're a dim-witted toad.

75
00:05:14,677 --> 00:05:17,221
"You're a dim-witted toad, sir?"

76
00:05:17,388 --> 00:05:19,390
No, actually, you are!

77
00:05:22,351 --> 00:05:23,853
There.

78
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:27,190
<i>Yet another groundbreaking feat of illusion</i>

79
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:31,194
<i>from the most innovative conjurer
the world has ever seen.</i>

80
00:05:31,736 --> 00:05:32,695
<i>Gargamania,</i>

81
00:05:32,778 --> 00:05:37,158
<i>the magical sensation that has captivated
the nation from New York to Las Vegas,</i>

82
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:40,244
<i>is now taking on the City of Light,
Paris, France.</i>

83
00:05:40,411 --> 00:05:44,165
<i>This master mysterio
has gone from unknown to unstoppable</i>

84
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:46,584
<i>after a surprise discovery in New York.</i>

85
00:05:51,255 --> 00:05:53,341
Yo, get out of the road, freak!

86
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:56,928
How dare you? How dare you call me "Yo"?

87
00:05:57,011 --> 00:06:00,097
Hey, no, put my car down.

88
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:02,934
Yo, how do you like it up there?

89
00:06:06,187 --> 00:06:07,396
Moron.

90
00:06:12,568 --> 00:06:16,238
<i>From New York street performer
to the new toast of Europe,</i>

91
00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:20,117
<i>the only magician ever to play
the famed Paris Opera House.</i>

92
00:06:20,201 --> 00:06:21,369
<i>Stay tuned.</i>

93
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,541
Oh, dear gods, can we please
just have one quiet carriage ride

94
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,628
without you tormenting me about
using up all the Smurf essence?

95
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:35,049
I extracted all I could from Papa Smurf
in the kingdom of New York.

96
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:36,884
How much essence did you extract?

97
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:39,470
I'm squandering it?

98
00:06:39,637 --> 00:06:40,638
What are you talking about?

99
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:44,141
I had to turn that man into a giant toad.
It's a magic show, isn't it?

100
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:47,603
Because without Smurf essence, I can't...

101
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:50,481
Why am I even discussing this with you?
You don't have any magic!

102
00:06:51,482 --> 00:06:53,818
Stick that on your
Facebook page and lick it.

103
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:55,486
Like it. Like it. Whatever.

104
00:06:56,821 --> 00:06:57,947
Besides,

105
00:06:58,114 --> 00:07:02,451
I still have plenty enough essence left to
carry out my delightfully diabolical plan.

106
00:07:03,744 --> 00:07:06,706
Now, my adoring public desires me.

107
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:08,624
Hello!

108
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,919
Hello, my lowly little bootlicks.

109
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:15,172
Yes, you must all worship me.

110
00:07:15,256 --> 00:07:16,257
Yes.

111
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:19,343
Even you, my flea-bitten little fur bag.

112
00:07:20,803 --> 00:07:25,057
All hail the great and powerful...

113
00:07:25,224 --> 00:07:28,102
Azrael... Azrael... Stop it.

114
00:07:28,644 --> 00:07:30,187
Open it! Open it!

115
00:07:33,357 --> 00:07:35,735
Come, Azrael. Hurry up.

116
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,704
Hello, handsome.

117
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:49,540
Look, a present.

118
00:07:49,707 --> 00:07:51,959
No doubt from a worshipping admirer.

119
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:55,129
It's for you.

120
00:07:58,132 --> 00:08:00,801
You are not more popular than I am.

121
00:08:02,803 --> 00:08:04,305
A little green dot?

122
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:07,683
Why do you get all the little green dots?

123
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,518
Get it, get it.

124
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,978
Father's going to love this.

125
00:08:11,062 --> 00:08:12,063
- Hackus want to play.
- Hey!

126
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:13,397
Let Hackus play with the kitty.

127
00:08:13,522 --> 00:08:14,732
Cover me.

128
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:15,858
I'm going in.

129
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,401
Hello, kitty.

130
00:08:18,235 --> 00:08:19,737
Vexy!

131
00:08:20,905 --> 00:08:22,573
All right, my little Naughties.

132
00:08:22,948 --> 00:08:24,033
Yeah!

133
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:27,078
Hackus to the rescue!

134
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:29,497
Booyah!

135
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:31,624
Good save, Hackus.

136
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:32,833
Pull, pull!

137
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:35,753
Hackus cat-fishing. Caught a big one.

138
00:08:35,836 --> 00:08:38,923
And round 12 goes to the Naughties.

139
00:08:41,217 --> 00:08:43,052
Well said, my dim brother.

140
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:45,429
Apparently, it wasn't a gift, Azrael.

141
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:46,931
It was a trap.

142
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:50,643
- Very amusing, my little Naughties.
- Hey!

143
00:08:50,726 --> 00:08:51,894
Did we please you, Father?

144
00:08:52,061 --> 00:08:53,979
No, no, you didn't.

145
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:58,859
You know what would please me, Vexy,
if you were blue like real Smurfs,

146
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:02,363
then your essence would endow me with real
magic like that of a true-blue Smurf.

147
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,366
That would excite me.

148
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:08,244
Instead, you're both just
deeply disappointing experiments.

149
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,537
Experiment?

150
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,623
Like my traitorous Smurfette.

151
00:09:12,748 --> 00:09:16,836
The banner goes over there, please.
Thank you, and I love the pinata.

152
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:19,213
- How's that, Gutsy?
- A little lower, Grouchy.

153
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:21,966
I want to be able to
whack him right in the smurf berries.

154
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:23,968
Hey, Grouchy. Hey, Gutsy.

155
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:27,221
What a cake!
Smurfette's gonna love this party!

156
00:09:27,304 --> 00:09:29,932
Hey, who smurfed a bite
out of Smurfette's birthday cake?

157
00:09:30,015 --> 00:09:31,016
- Not me.
- I don't know.

158
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,144
- Greedy?
- What? Why you all looking at me?

159
00:09:33,227 --> 00:09:36,397
Hey, Brainy, here's my present
for Smurfette's surprise party.

160
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,025
Come on, Jokey, do you really think that I,
the smartest Smurf in the village,

161
00:09:40,109 --> 00:09:41,986
- would fall for your sophomoric gag?
- Yep.

162
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:43,821
Just give me the card.

163
00:09:44,947 --> 00:09:47,074
Out-smurfed by a simpleton.

164
00:09:47,158 --> 00:09:50,161
- She's coming. Smurfette's coming.
- Oh, no! The surprise will be ruined.

165
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:54,248
Code blue! Code blue!
Repeat, this is not a drill. Code blue.

166
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:55,416
Undo it, unglue it!

167
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:56,834
We gotta get her out of here!

168
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:59,044
Here she is! Act natural!

169
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:00,504
Hey, guys.

170
00:10:00,671 --> 00:10:04,175
Anyone want to do anything fun
on this special day?

171
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,177
Hey, Vanity.

172
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,596
Want to sit by the fountain
and look at your reflection?

173
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:11,640
Kind of tired of looking
at myself, Smurfette.

174
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:12,933
As if.

175
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:14,935
Nope, not building anything for anybody.

176
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:16,020
- Hey, Party Planner.
- Hey.

177
00:10:16,103 --> 00:10:17,938
- Hey, Social Smurf.
- Yes, darling?

178
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:21,108
Anything fun coming up
that I should know about?

179
00:10:21,192 --> 00:10:23,444
No, nothing till Smurfapalooza.

180
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:25,863
It's going to be wild, right, Social Smurf?

181
00:10:25,946 --> 00:10:30,618
Yeah. I've got it all over the Smurf Web.
It's got 101 likes on Smurf book.

182
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:32,077
I will put you on the guest list.

183
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:35,289
So, no one remembered my birthday?

184
00:10:35,414 --> 00:10:37,374
The surprise is gonna be ruined!

185
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,418
Hush up! Hush up!

186
00:10:41,212 --> 00:10:46,300
You know, Smurfette, occasionally,
it's good to have a little alone time.

187
00:10:46,383 --> 00:10:49,803
- Yeah, so take a hike.
- Yeah, we don't need you here, we're good.

188
00:10:49,887 --> 00:10:50,888
- Bye.
- There you go.

189
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:52,473
See you.

190
00:10:52,556 --> 00:10:55,434
We fooled her pretty good,
don't you think, Clueless Smurf?

191
00:10:55,517 --> 00:11:00,147
Yeah!
She's got no idea about the surprise party!

192
00:11:01,523 --> 00:11:02,566
Dude.

193
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:09,740
Maybe I really don't belong here.

194
00:11:24,213 --> 00:11:26,090
Okay, blow out the candles, Blue.

195
00:11:26,757 --> 00:11:28,759
Nice.

196
00:11:29,677 --> 00:11:32,304
Okay, I think
I've got everyone's issues covered here.

197
00:11:32,388 --> 00:11:37,101
This is an organic, gluten-free,
antioxidant-rich acai berry cake

198
00:11:37,268 --> 00:11:43,023
made locally by a cruelty-free baker
who swears he's never even seen a peanut.

199
00:11:43,107 --> 00:11:44,733
Everybody good? Right?

200
00:11:44,817 --> 00:11:47,611
- Are these plates PCB-free?
- No.

201
00:11:47,695 --> 00:11:52,032
- Actually, we're good.
- Actually, we're good. PCB and BPA-free.

202
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:53,325
Daddy, can we cut the cake?

203
00:11:53,492 --> 00:11:54,493
- Yeah.
- All right, let's do that.

204
00:11:54,576 --> 00:11:55,744
Cut it.

205
00:11:55,828 --> 00:11:58,038
Boy, who thought parenting
could be so complicated?

206
00:11:58,122 --> 00:11:59,373
- Yummy.
- Seriously, guys?

207
00:11:59,456 --> 00:12:00,457
You guys make it look easy.

208
00:12:00,624 --> 00:12:02,543
Yeah, you must have had a great role model.

209
00:12:03,627 --> 00:12:04,670
No, not really.

210
00:12:04,795 --> 00:12:08,549
- My dad took off when I was five, so...
- Am I late?

211
00:12:09,508 --> 00:12:10,509
Did I miss all the presents?

212
00:12:11,093 --> 00:12:12,553
Hey!

213
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,348
- Grandpa Vicster!
- Hey!

214
00:12:17,391 --> 00:12:18,434
Happy birthday, Blue.

215
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,769
Now it's a party. Hello.

216
00:12:20,936 --> 00:12:22,271
I'm Victor, Patrick's dad.

217
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:25,858
And you must all be his friends,
which makes you my friends.

218
00:12:25,941 --> 00:12:26,942
So let's go.

219
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:28,694
Arms in the air, you're all getting hugs.

220
00:12:28,861 --> 00:12:29,903
Hey, okay.

221
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,489
I thought you said your father left you.

222
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:34,783
He did. This is my stepfather.

223
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:36,452
You'll want him to leave. Just wait.

224
00:12:36,577 --> 00:12:38,495
Hello. Where's my Gracie?

225
00:12:38,662 --> 00:12:40,497
- Hey.
- Victor.

226
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,041
How are you?

227
00:12:42,124 --> 00:12:43,250
You know, ever since Blue was born,

228
00:12:43,334 --> 00:12:46,920
I kind of miss you being as big as a house
with more of you to hug.

229
00:12:47,004 --> 00:12:48,047
Yep.

230
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,674
And now, I've saved the
biggest hug for last.

231
00:12:50,841 --> 00:12:52,968
- Boundaries, please. Boundaries.
- Let's show them how it's done.

232
00:12:53,135 --> 00:12:54,595
Unhand me.

233
00:12:54,803 --> 00:12:57,264
I don't like this at all.

234
00:12:57,848 --> 00:12:58,974
Thank you.

235
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:01,810
There's nothing like
the embrace of two proud Doyle men.

236
00:13:01,977 --> 00:13:03,187
I am not a Doyle man.

237
00:13:03,354 --> 00:13:04,355
Little Paddy Doyle.

238
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:06,815
- Winslow.
- Okay, compromise. Winslow.

239
00:13:06,982 --> 00:13:08,692
Hyphen-Doyle.

240
00:13:09,651 --> 00:13:13,530
Hey, isn't he the guy
from the Korndog commercials on TV?

241
00:13:13,614 --> 00:13:15,699
- Hey, you're right.
- Well, you got me.

242
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:17,117
- Korndog King.
- No, no, no.

243
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:18,160
- One moment.
- Please not this.

244
00:13:18,243 --> 00:13:20,704
Now, in honour of Blue's birthday,

245
00:13:20,913 --> 00:13:23,415
I'm going to present each and every
one of you with a free Korndog...

246
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,042
- Thank you.
- ...on the house.

247
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:27,044
Teriaki dog.

248
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:28,504
That's for you.

249
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,339
Do these have any peanuts?

250
00:13:30,506 --> 00:13:33,008
I would never put peanuts in a Korndog.

251
00:13:33,175 --> 00:13:34,176
Great.

252
00:13:34,343 --> 00:13:35,677
Go ahead, big guy, it's okay.

253
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:38,680
For the simple reason, you see,
we deep-fry them in peanut oil.

254
00:13:38,806 --> 00:13:39,807
Peanut oil?

255
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,601
- What?
- Johnny, spit it... Spit it out right away!

256
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:44,228
Okay, I got the phone, okay.

257
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:47,731
Spit it out, Johnny! Spit it out right away!
Into Mama's hands.

258
00:13:47,856 --> 00:13:48,899
Deep breath for the EpiPen.

259
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:51,235
- It's okay.
- What's happening to that kid's lips?

260
00:13:55,572 --> 00:13:58,033
- Azrael, bring me my plan.
- Father?

261
00:13:58,117 --> 00:14:00,160
It's in the bathroom.
Check my side of the sink.

262
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:01,245
Father?

263
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:02,955
It's feeding time.

264
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:04,832
Hackus dizzy.

265
00:14:04,998 --> 00:14:07,000
Yes, I almost forgot.

266
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:09,420
Apparently, I have to keep you alive.

267
00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:13,841
I hope you both appreciate
what a tremendous burden this is upon me.

268
00:14:13,924 --> 00:14:15,134
All right, mind your manners.

269
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,552
Thank you.

270
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:20,848
If you were real Smurfs,
I'd be taking essence from you.

271
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:24,518
I didn't hear a "thank you."

272
00:14:24,685 --> 00:14:26,311
Close enough. Come, come.

273
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:30,607
We must review my plan
before tonight's raid on Smurf Village.

274
00:14:32,693 --> 00:14:35,737
This is not my writing parchment.
Where is my plan?

275
00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:37,739
"Gone digital"?

276
00:14:37,906 --> 00:14:39,950
I don't understand what that means.

277
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:43,454
Yes, phase one, "Create Naughties." Yes.

278
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,622
Check. Where is phase two?

279
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:51,962
I am enamoured of that swiping motion.

280
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:54,715
Yes, get away, get away,
get away, get away.

281
00:14:54,798 --> 00:14:57,759
Phase three... Swipe.

282
00:14:57,926 --> 00:14:59,720
I capture my ungrateful daughter

283
00:14:59,803 --> 00:15:04,016
and force her to tell me the secret formula
that Papa used to turn her blue.

284
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:05,184
Swipe.

285
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,394
I turn you and hundreds
other like you blue.

286
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:08,479
Hackus blue!

287
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:10,481
Hackus blue!

288
00:15:10,647 --> 00:15:14,401
I place you into a terrifying machine
and extract your essence.

289
00:15:14,526 --> 00:15:15,527
- What?
- And then,

290
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:19,615
the entire world shall bow before me!

291
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:23,619
Will that extracting thing hurt?

292
00:15:23,785 --> 00:15:26,288
It's excruciatingly painless.

293
00:15:26,371 --> 00:15:28,499
You'll see, it'll be fun, for me.

294
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:30,584
Anyway, we're getting ahead of ourselves.

295
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:36,089
Back to phase two, the very reason
we came to this cheese-infested metropolis.

296
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:39,593
The great iron spire.

297
00:15:39,676 --> 00:15:41,261
The only possible way

298
00:15:41,345 --> 00:15:45,849
to harness enough energy to create a portal
right into the heart of Smurf Village.

299
00:15:47,184 --> 00:15:48,602
How I love portal creation.

300
00:15:48,685 --> 00:15:51,772
Come, come, let us away! To the iron spire!

301
00:16:33,855 --> 00:16:35,941
It worked!

302
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:38,569
Yes! Just enough essence!

303
00:16:47,077 --> 00:16:50,664
And now I will go down in history!

304
00:16:50,747 --> 00:16:53,625
Nothing can stop me now!

305
00:16:58,338 --> 00:17:00,424
My Gargaberries!

306
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:03,802
Oh, no!

307
00:17:06,346 --> 00:17:09,141
Now I shall prove my genius!

308
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:14,229
Head spin!

309
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:24,281
It appears I lack sufficient essence
to create a human-size portal.

310
00:17:24,364 --> 00:17:27,576
Father, I can fit through there.
Let me get Smurfette.

311
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:28,702
Hackus go! Hackus go!

312
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:30,203
- Hey!
- Hackus go!

313
00:17:30,287 --> 00:17:33,248
Yes, yes. Well, let's see here.

314
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:37,044
- Eeny, meeny, miny...
- Pick me! Pick me!

315
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:38,170
Moron.

316
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:39,212
Yes!

317
00:17:39,296 --> 00:17:42,341
- Hey, Hackus, listen to this.
- What?

318
00:17:42,424 --> 00:17:43,634
I win.

319
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,385
Nicely played, Vexy.

320
00:17:45,469 --> 00:17:47,054
Now, I must warn you.

321
00:17:47,137 --> 00:17:49,723
Your destination is a true horror.

322
00:17:49,806 --> 00:17:54,311
A realm filled with
the relentless crushing quiet of peace,

323
00:17:54,394 --> 00:17:57,606
punctuated by
the wretched cacophony of joyousness.

324
00:17:57,689 --> 00:17:59,441
- It's horrible.
- What a nightmare.

325
00:17:59,524 --> 00:18:01,902
Yes, yes, it completely ruined your sister.

326
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:04,279
It's such a shame when
a bad girl turns good.

327
00:18:04,363 --> 00:18:05,364
So true.

328
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,992
But she does know the secret formula,

329
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:12,329
so go get Smurfette!

330
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,086
I just don't get it.

331
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:22,297
They know how tough my birthday can be,

332
00:18:22,422 --> 00:18:25,258
and they didn't even remember.

333
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:28,178
Maybe Papa was wrong.

334
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:31,181
Guess I'll never really be one of them.

335
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:38,689
- Oh, no!
- Help.

336
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:41,441
Please, wait.

337
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:44,027
I escaped.

338
00:18:44,236 --> 00:18:45,362
Escaped?

339
00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:48,907
From the evil wizard who made me.

340
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:52,119
Do you mean Gargamel?

341
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:54,788
Is Gargamel your father?

342
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:56,331
Yes.

343
00:18:56,498 --> 00:18:59,042
But he's...

344
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:01,920
That means you're just like me.

345
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:04,172
- Gotcha!
- What are you doing?

346
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:06,216
Father's going to be very happy.

347
00:19:06,466 --> 00:19:07,968
Smurfette's in trouble!

348
00:19:08,051 --> 00:19:09,177
- Crikey!
- Oh, no!

349
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:11,304
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Smurfette!

350
00:19:11,388 --> 00:19:12,973
No!

351
00:19:14,057 --> 00:19:15,809
- Oh, no, you don't.
- No!

352
00:19:15,976 --> 00:19:17,394
- Let go!
- Now get in there!

353
00:19:17,477 --> 00:19:19,020
Oh, no!

354
00:19:19,104 --> 00:19:22,232
- She's being smurf napped.
- Unhand her!

355
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:25,026
So long, Smurfs.

356
00:19:25,402 --> 00:19:27,154
- Smurfette!
- Smurfette!

357
00:19:27,237 --> 00:19:28,363
What are we gonna do now?

358
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:33,285
My powers of deduction lead me to believe
that this is the work of Gargamel.

359
00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:39,416
Oh, no, oh, no!

360
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:43,086
- Yes!
- Pretty blue.

361
00:19:44,004 --> 00:19:45,505
Gargamel.

362
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:48,717
Smurfette. Welcome home.

363
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,517
You're wasting your time, Gargamel.

364
00:19:57,601 --> 00:19:59,311
Papa and the others are gonna come for me.

365
00:19:59,394 --> 00:20:02,230
I don't think so.

366
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:03,857
They came for Clumsy.

367
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,613
Yes, but you see, Clumsy was a real Smurf.

368
00:20:10,947 --> 00:20:13,909
Whereas I was the one who created you.

369
00:20:14,451 --> 00:20:16,536
You do remember that, don't you, dear?

370
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:21,458
You're not my father. Just let me go home.

371
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,876
Of course.

372
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:24,252
Anything you say,

373
00:20:24,336 --> 00:20:30,383
but first, I will need one itsy-bitsy,
teeny-tiny little thing first.

374
00:20:30,467 --> 00:20:32,511
- Teeny-tiny.
- What?

375
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:38,558
Just the secret formula that Papa
used to turn you into a real Smurf.

376
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:41,394
Hackus real Smurf. Hackus blue!

377
00:20:41,478 --> 00:20:42,687
Like you, blondie.

378
00:20:42,854 --> 00:20:45,232
It would benefit us both,
don't you see, my dear?

379
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:48,527
You give me the formula,
I turn my little Naughties blue.

380
00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:50,403
- Blue.
- I use their essence

381
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:53,615
to continue with
my wonderful magic show here.

382
00:20:53,698 --> 00:20:58,245
That way I never have to bother you
or Smurf Village again.

383
00:20:58,453 --> 00:21:01,331
I don't trust you,
and I'm not telling you anything.

384
00:21:01,498 --> 00:21:06,002
Well,
perhaps you need a little persuasion, eh?

385
00:21:07,087 --> 00:21:08,338
Naughties, attack!

386
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:10,382
With pleasure.

387
00:21:10,465 --> 00:21:11,508
Attack!

388
00:21:11,675 --> 00:21:13,552
- No, no, no, not each other.
- Not me!

389
00:21:13,718 --> 00:21:15,595
I got you...

390
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,930
Hackus!

391
00:21:17,097 --> 00:21:18,640
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

392
00:21:20,517 --> 00:21:22,727
Not the cat, not the...

393
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:25,730
Deeply, deeply disappointing experiments.

394
00:21:25,981 --> 00:21:27,482
We've got to rescue Smurfette.

395
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:29,067
What's our plan to bring Smurfette home?

396
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,610
All right, Smurfs, listen up.

397
00:21:30,694 --> 00:21:35,448
I saved enough grotto water from the last
blue moon for just such an occasion.

398
00:21:35,532 --> 00:21:38,869
I was able to
smurf it into smurfportation crystals.

399
00:21:38,994 --> 00:21:42,038
So you don't need a portal.
Very clever, Papa.

400
00:21:42,205 --> 00:21:43,415
Smurf-xactly.

401
00:21:43,498 --> 00:21:46,501
These will take us directly to
Master Winslow's mushroom.

402
00:21:46,626 --> 00:21:49,838
Yeah, Patrick and Grace helped us
last time we smurfed through the portal.

403
00:21:49,921 --> 00:21:51,798
Precisely! They'll know what to do!

404
00:21:51,923 --> 00:21:52,924
- Sign me up!
- Sign me up.

405
00:21:53,008 --> 00:21:53,967
- At your service, Papa.
- Pick me!

406
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,635
- Did someone say, "Baker should go"?
- I would rather not.

407
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:56,720
Me, me, pick me, Papa!

408
00:21:56,803 --> 00:22:00,181
Now, now, Smurfs.
I only had water enough for nine crystals.

409
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:04,561
That's me and three others round trip,
plus Smurfette on the way home.

410
00:22:04,728 --> 00:22:06,688
Assuming you can find her, which you won't.

411
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:10,400
That's not a very smurfy attitude, Grouchy.

412
00:22:10,483 --> 00:22:12,569
Actually, for me, that was pretty good.

413
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,739
I'll need courage,
intelligence and strength.

414
00:22:15,822 --> 00:22:17,115
- So Gutsy.
- Aye.

415
00:22:17,198 --> 00:22:18,325
- Brainy.
- Of course.

416
00:22:18,408 --> 00:22:19,534
- Hefty.
- You got it.

417
00:22:19,743 --> 00:22:21,494
- You'll smurf with me.
- Yeah, can I...

418
00:22:21,578 --> 00:22:23,830
Yes, Passive-Aggressive Smurf?

419
00:22:23,914 --> 00:22:27,751
I think Brainy is a
really excellent choice.

420
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:28,835
Good luck with that.

421
00:22:29,002 --> 00:22:30,211
You see what he does?

422
00:22:30,295 --> 00:22:32,172
- That's not a compliment.
- Go figure.

423
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:34,591
- Okay, Hefty, take one.
- Let's do this.

424
00:22:34,716 --> 00:22:36,760
- Go get her, guys!
- Oops!

425
00:22:36,843 --> 00:22:37,844
Clumsy.

426
00:22:37,928 --> 00:22:39,179
Somebody do something!

427
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:41,514
Stand back! I know the Smurflich manoeuvre.

428
00:22:41,848 --> 00:22:42,849
He doesn't look good.

429
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:44,851
Oh, dear, he's turning blue-er.

430
00:22:44,935 --> 00:22:45,936
Not good.

431
00:22:46,978 --> 00:22:48,897
Somebody get my hammer!

432
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,857
Nice going, Clumsy.

433
00:22:51,858 --> 00:22:54,235
I got it!

434
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,862
Cheerio!

435
00:22:56,029 --> 00:22:58,198
This was supposed to be Hefty!

436
00:22:58,281 --> 00:22:59,699
Sorry! My bad!

437
00:22:59,783 --> 00:23:02,327
I get so puffy when I travel.

438
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,411
Bye.

439
00:23:03,578 --> 00:23:07,248
Well, sometimes,
you got to smurf with the changes.

440
00:23:07,332 --> 00:23:08,416
Travel safe, Papa.

441
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:11,211
And so Papa and his B team...

442
00:23:11,294 --> 00:23:12,754
I'll be in charge while you're gone!

443
00:23:12,837 --> 00:23:15,048
- And so Papa...
- Go get Smurfette back!

444
00:23:15,131 --> 00:23:17,884
- Come on!
- And bring her home!

445
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,974
I'm glad his throat opened up
and his lips are back to normal.

446
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,809
Again, we're so sorry.

447
00:23:25,976 --> 00:23:27,978
If... Hello?

448
00:23:29,396 --> 00:23:33,858
Johnny can breathe again, which makes two of
us since both of his parents are lawyers.

449
00:23:33,942 --> 00:23:36,820
Well, that's why they overreacted.

450
00:23:36,903 --> 00:23:38,113
They didn't overreact.

451
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:39,948
He's dying.

452
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:43,118
I think it's time for this.

453
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:46,413
You didn't bring the crown.
Don't put the crown on him.

454
00:23:46,496 --> 00:23:47,998
Come on, you used to love this crown.

455
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:49,457
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

456
00:23:49,624 --> 00:23:51,209
- You wore it everywhere.
- I did not.

457
00:23:51,334 --> 00:23:52,377
Never did. Never once.

458
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,588
This is the way you do it... Look.

459
00:23:56,965 --> 00:23:58,967
Do you see what is going on out there?

460
00:24:00,927 --> 00:24:02,804
Yeah, they're bonding.

461
00:24:04,347 --> 00:24:06,099
- Technically, they're spitting.
- Come on.

462
00:24:06,182 --> 00:24:08,601
Blue needs to know that
family's not just you and me,

463
00:24:08,685 --> 00:24:10,603
and it's really good for him
to play with his grandfather.

464
00:24:10,812 --> 00:24:12,188
Good job!

465
00:24:12,355 --> 00:24:14,983
- Oh, yeah. He's a terrific role model.
- Come on, Patrick.

466
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:16,526
Grace, he ruins everything.

467
00:24:16,693 --> 00:24:20,280
He shows up, and he ruins things.
That's what he does.

468
00:24:20,864 --> 00:24:23,616
Just like when he first
moved into my house.

469
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,910
He sent my parrot away.

470
00:24:25,994 --> 00:24:26,995
Your parrot?

471
00:24:27,162 --> 00:24:29,164
My father's parrot.

472
00:24:30,081 --> 00:24:35,920
When my dad took off, he left Zeus,
and I loved that bird.

473
00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:40,842
I was a kid, and Zeus
was the only part of my dad I had left.

474
00:24:44,763 --> 00:24:46,056
There you go.

475
00:24:49,434 --> 00:24:50,477
What?

476
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:00,111
Get Blue. Blue?

477
00:25:01,321 --> 00:25:02,781
Blue?

478
00:25:03,573 --> 00:25:06,242
Blue! Victor!

479
00:25:18,755 --> 00:25:20,173
- Stay there.
- Victor, do you have Blue?

480
00:25:20,381 --> 00:25:21,549
Victor! We can't get the door open!

481
00:25:21,758 --> 00:25:23,009
Victor!

482
00:25:23,176 --> 00:25:25,595
- Victor, open the door!
- Victor, we can't open the door!

483
00:25:31,601 --> 00:25:33,603
I can't see! I can't see!

484
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,482
I'm on a dark, lifeless planet
that smells like corn dogs!

485
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:40,527
Oh, the smurfanity.

486
00:25:44,614 --> 00:25:48,284
Sorry, mister. Your face got in the way.

487
00:25:50,286 --> 00:25:51,955
- Is that Clumsy? Smurfs?
- Clumsy?

488
00:25:52,122 --> 00:25:53,706
- Help!
- Look out, Grouchy!

489
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,416
- Clumsy, is that you?
- This way!

490
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,961
- I'm blind!
- No, you're in a corn dog.

491
00:25:58,128 --> 00:25:59,254
I knew it would end this way!

492
00:26:03,383 --> 00:26:04,592
Where am I?

493
00:26:04,801 --> 00:26:07,637
This place is strange and terrifying

494
00:26:07,804 --> 00:26:10,140
and so handsome.

495
00:26:10,265 --> 00:26:11,975
Hello, you.

496
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,145
- No! '

497
00:26:15,645 --> 00:26:17,480
We're lost in the dark,
and it smells like corn dogs!

498
00:26:17,647 --> 00:26:18,648
Watch out!

499
00:26:19,816 --> 00:26:21,442
Master Winslow's gotten old.

500
00:26:21,651 --> 00:26:23,236
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Blue?

501
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:25,446
Stop, stop, stop. They're friends.

502
00:26:25,613 --> 00:26:26,614
- Friends?
- Yeah.

503
00:26:26,698 --> 00:26:28,658
They're little blue aliens
trying to steal our faces.

504
00:26:28,825 --> 00:26:30,451
No, no, they're called Smurfs.

505
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:33,788
And they are the sweetest little things
you ever did see.

506
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:34,873
Not me.

507
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,000
No, not you, Grouchy.

508
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:38,209
Papa, Clumsy.

509
00:26:38,376 --> 00:26:39,794
- Patrick!
- Master Winslow.

510
00:26:39,878 --> 00:26:42,338
- Hi, Grace.
- Smurf, Smurf, Smurf!

511
00:26:42,505 --> 00:26:45,091
- Is that Blue?
- He's huge.

512
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,677
I wouldn't want to be
the stork that brought that guy.

513
00:26:48,469 --> 00:26:53,516
Well, if Blue likes the Smurfs,
then Vicster likes the Smurfs.

514
00:26:53,683 --> 00:26:56,644
What a thrill this must be for all of you.

515
00:26:56,728 --> 00:26:58,479
No pictures, please.

516
00:26:58,563 --> 00:26:59,564
That's Vanity.

517
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:01,149
Narcissist.

518
00:27:01,316 --> 00:27:02,317
What are you guys doing here?

519
00:27:02,442 --> 00:27:03,818
Smurfette's been taken.

520
00:27:03,985 --> 00:27:05,236
- Wait, what?
- Taken? What do you mean "taken"?

521
00:27:05,445 --> 00:27:07,697
Smurf napped by that ghastly Gargamel.

522
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,575
She was off alone
because she thought we forgot her birthday.

523
00:27:10,783 --> 00:27:13,119
There was a misunderstanding.

524
00:27:13,203 --> 00:27:15,830
But if we can find him, we'll find her.

525
00:27:15,914 --> 00:27:17,874
Well, that shouldn't be hard.
He's a big star now.

526
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:19,876
- He's in Paris.
- I'll call the dog sitter.

527
00:27:20,043 --> 00:27:21,211
You get Blue's passport.

528
00:27:21,377 --> 00:27:24,464
Yes, a rescue mission. I'll come, too.

529
00:27:24,672 --> 00:27:25,715
You need all the help you can get.

530
00:27:25,924 --> 00:27:27,592
Wait a minute, Blue's passport?

531
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,427
We can't just up and go to Paris.

532
00:27:29,594 --> 00:27:31,930
At least, not all of us.

533
00:27:32,096 --> 00:27:36,601
Okay, so that's one vote no. Who votes yes?

534
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:39,854
- Me.
- Of course.

535
00:27:41,314 --> 00:27:43,316
Daddy always loses.

536
00:27:43,483 --> 00:27:46,402
Look, this is my Smurfette
we're talking about. We have to go.

537
00:27:46,861 --> 00:27:50,657
If we're going to be traveling,
let's make sure we do this properly.

538
00:28:16,266 --> 00:28:18,935
Okay, here we are. Victor,
can you get Blue?

539
00:28:19,811 --> 00:28:21,271
- All right. We're all clear on the plan, right?
- Yeah.

540
00:28:21,354 --> 00:28:22,438
We'll head over to Gargamel's show

541
00:28:22,522 --> 00:28:24,107
- and see if Smurfette's there.
- Yes.

542
00:28:24,274 --> 00:28:27,110
And I'll go to Gargamel's hotel and see
if I can find out what room he's in.

543
00:28:27,193 --> 00:28:29,654
And, Victor, you and Blue
can just check into the room here.

544
00:28:29,737 --> 00:28:33,074
- Well, actually, I was thinking...
- No. "Actually, I" nothing.

545
00:28:33,283 --> 00:28:34,284
You and Blue, upstairs.

546
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,618
That's the deal. End of story.

547
00:28:38,496 --> 00:28:39,998
L'Opera House, s'il vous plait.

548
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,667
My French is tres sexy, non?

549
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,712
- Oui, maybe I'll get you a beret.
- You cannot handle me in a beret.

550
00:28:45,795 --> 00:28:48,715
- Is that what you think? I can't...
- Hey!

551
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:50,008
Get a shroom.

552
00:28:52,176 --> 00:28:53,594
- Good luck.
- You, too.

553
00:28:53,678 --> 00:28:54,929
Okay.

554
00:28:55,972 --> 00:28:59,225
Give him the formula.

555
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:02,186
Give him the formula.

556
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,689
Give him the formula.

557
00:29:04,772 --> 00:29:07,442
You want to give it to him.

558
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:09,569
You'll feel better about yourself

559
00:29:09,777 --> 00:29:13,323
if you stop being such an annoying
little brat and give him the formula.

560
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,705
Make her stop. It burns.

561
00:29:20,788 --> 00:29:25,043
Hackus tell you everything I know.

562
00:29:25,335 --> 00:29:27,837
Hackus doesn't know anything.

563
00:29:28,838 --> 00:29:30,840
What? What?

564
00:29:30,923 --> 00:29:32,717
"Buffering"? What the...

565
00:29:34,177 --> 00:29:35,470
My public awaits.

566
00:29:35,553 --> 00:29:39,640
Once again I must go astound
and confound the merry imbeciles.

567
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,644
What do you mean, I'm out of essence?

568
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:46,022
We can still do the show, all right.

569
00:29:46,731 --> 00:29:51,486
Because we got all the essence we need
right here now, don't we?

570
00:29:52,362 --> 00:29:54,030
I'm going to need a little snip.

571
00:29:54,197 --> 00:29:55,823
Oh, no!

572
00:29:55,948 --> 00:29:58,826
Just going to take a little
off around the ears.

573
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,911
There.

574
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:02,246
When my Papa gets here,
you're gonna be sorry.

575
00:30:02,413 --> 00:30:06,501
Your Papa is not coming
because your real Papa is already here.

576
00:30:06,584 --> 00:30:07,960
- Yeah!
- Now,

577
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:11,506
you can either be a good little girl
and give me the formula,

578
00:30:11,589 --> 00:30:14,967
or you can spend the rest
of your miserable little existence

579
00:30:15,051 --> 00:30:19,305
being harvested
inside my new superpowered Smurfalator!

580
00:30:19,389 --> 00:30:21,307
Your call entirely. Really.

581
00:30:21,432 --> 00:30:22,809
Up to you.

582
00:30:22,975 --> 00:30:24,811
Father! Father!

583
00:30:25,728 --> 00:30:26,938
Yes!

584
00:30:27,105 --> 00:30:28,356
Nice work, my dear.

585
00:30:28,439 --> 00:30:31,317
And as for you, nice try.

586
00:30:33,403 --> 00:30:34,404
Yes, Azrael.

587
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,656
You can press the button
on the Smurfalator.

588
00:30:36,739 --> 00:30:37,824
Come, come, come!

589
00:30:38,032 --> 00:30:40,410
We'll brew this hair into Smurf essence!

590
00:30:42,912 --> 00:30:45,957
Papa, please hurry.

591
00:30:46,124 --> 00:30:47,917
I'm so scared.

592
00:30:50,378 --> 00:30:52,338
Poor baby's gonna cry.

593
00:30:52,422 --> 00:30:53,923
Hello, pretty lady.

594
00:30:54,006 --> 00:30:56,300
Hackus pretty, too.

595
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:04,976
- Hi.
- Hello.

596
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:07,437
I was just wondering if you could be
so kind as to tell me what room...

597
00:31:07,645 --> 00:31:09,355
What room Monsieur Gargamel is in?

598
00:31:09,522 --> 00:31:11,607
No. Hotel policy.

599
00:31:18,197 --> 00:31:19,282
Just right over there. Thanks.

600
00:31:19,365 --> 00:31:20,950
Here we are, guys, the Paris Opera House.

601
00:31:22,285 --> 00:31:25,788
- Not too shabby.
- Gargamel's really come up in the world.

602
00:31:27,165 --> 00:31:29,459
I hope Smurfette's here.

603
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,670
I do love a good musical. Guilty!

604
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:41,095
- What did he just say?
- I have no idea.

605
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,822
Well, wait a minute, wait a minute.

606
00:31:59,906 --> 00:32:03,409
I asked for a shroud of mystery.
This is a wisp!

607
00:32:04,076 --> 00:32:06,662
Alakazatmosphere!

608
00:32:07,705 --> 00:32:09,165
Holy smurf!

609
00:32:09,373 --> 00:32:12,919
- Where did that come from?
- He's never had this much power before.

610
00:32:26,015 --> 00:32:28,976
Well, I am outraged!

611
00:32:29,185 --> 00:32:30,394
Positively outraged.

612
00:32:30,603 --> 00:32:32,396
I'm sorry, who are you?

613
00:32:32,605 --> 00:32:37,109
I am Monsieur Gargamel's manager,
Madame Doolittle.

614
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,113
What is this outhouse you call a room?

615
00:32:41,364 --> 00:32:43,366
- The Napoleon Suite?
- Napoleon Suite? Yes.

616
00:32:43,449 --> 00:32:45,117
But, Madame,
this is the finest room in all the hotel.

617
00:32:45,284 --> 00:32:46,869
What could possibly...

618
00:32:47,036 --> 00:32:50,122
Well, for starters, darling,
it's on the wrong floor.

619
00:32:50,206 --> 00:32:52,166
No one wants to be on the...

620
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:55,962
- The fifth floor.
- Yes. Yes, that's much too low.

621
00:32:56,921 --> 00:32:58,464
Oh, boy.

622
00:33:00,258 --> 00:33:01,300
Good evening! Good evening!

623
00:33:01,384 --> 00:33:02,760
Okay, guys, we're going in.

624
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:04,929
No, no, no.

625
00:33:08,182 --> 00:33:09,141
Great.

626
00:33:09,225 --> 00:33:11,143
Okay, Papa,
sneak out the back of my sweater

627
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,396
while I talk to this man
who has no idea what I'm saying

628
00:33:13,563 --> 00:33:14,855
and go find that dressing room.

629
00:33:15,064 --> 00:33:19,151
This is a great vacation, guys.
I can feel the stress melting right off me.

630
00:33:19,235 --> 00:33:22,321
- Don't spiral, Grouchy.
- Yeah. We got this.

631
00:33:22,405 --> 00:33:26,075
- Gentlemen, we have a cat problem.
- Get down, get down.

632
00:33:27,994 --> 00:33:29,912
There! No, no, don't be alarmed.

633
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:32,164
This is how I treat all the critics.

634
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:35,126
Hurry, up those ropes.

635
00:33:35,209 --> 00:33:37,003
Is Smurfette really worth all this?

636
00:33:37,086 --> 00:33:38,421
- I'm just saying.
- Let's go.

637
00:33:38,629 --> 00:33:41,048
- Not permis. Not permis.
- What? This is outrageous.

638
00:33:41,215 --> 00:33:43,134
Your families will all pay dearly.

639
00:33:43,217 --> 00:33:45,845
As a result, some of you may die.

640
00:34:00,901 --> 00:34:02,236
No, I'm sorry, you will need your key card.

641
00:34:02,445 --> 00:34:05,072
Yes, of course, darling, my key card!

642
00:34:06,032 --> 00:34:08,200
Oh, dear, I've left it.

643
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:13,205
Oui, I was having breakfast at Tiffany's.

644
00:34:15,499 --> 00:34:18,461
I'll just go back and get it.

645
00:34:25,926 --> 00:34:29,305
I bet my glutes look great
climbing up this rope.

646
00:34:29,388 --> 00:34:30,890
Grouchy, take a look.

647
00:34:30,973 --> 00:34:32,016
I hate my life.

648
00:34:32,808 --> 00:34:35,269
- Clumsy!
- Move it.

649
00:34:35,353 --> 00:34:37,396
...Interrupt my sorcery,
at least I should be amused.

650
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:43,069
Now, you will all kindly hail to the great
and exceedingly powerful Gargamel...

651
00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:45,488
What are you doing out here? How dare you?

652
00:34:46,822 --> 00:34:49,450
You smell something suspicious?
Well, of course you do!

653
00:34:49,617 --> 00:34:51,035
I've seen where you put your nose.

654
00:34:51,202 --> 00:34:52,662
Now, get out of here.

655
00:34:52,828 --> 00:34:53,829
Hi, Daddy.

656
00:34:53,954 --> 00:34:56,290
- Blue?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, just listen...

657
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:58,417
Blue and I decided
we can't let you run solo on this.

658
00:34:58,542 --> 00:34:59,543
We can do this together.

659
00:35:00,544 --> 00:35:03,255
Three generations of proud Doyle men
standing shoulder to shoulder.

660
00:35:03,506 --> 00:35:05,424
Even though we're all
different heights and whatnot.

661
00:35:05,675 --> 00:35:07,760
We are not Doyle men.

662
00:35:07,927 --> 00:35:09,136
Winslow-hyphen-Doyle.

663
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,223
You have a bee in your bonnet
about the whole name thing.

664
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,391
Why do you chortle?

665
00:35:13,474 --> 00:35:16,519
Usually, in magic, the cats are big, no?

666
00:35:16,686 --> 00:35:18,771
Like tiger or like lions, you know?

667
00:35:19,021 --> 00:35:22,400
Silence, knave! And allow me to oblige you.

668
00:35:22,483 --> 00:35:24,485
Alakazanimal!

669
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:35,204
Try not to smell delicious!

670
00:35:35,287 --> 00:35:37,790
So far, this is the worst trip of my life!

671
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,333
And I've only taken two!

672
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:42,128
- Look! There's Gargamel's dressing room.
- Good eye, Vanity.

673
00:35:42,211 --> 00:35:44,213
Please! He's got a star on his door.

674
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,339
Let's go.

675
00:35:45,423 --> 00:35:47,717
Remind me to put a star
on my mushroom when we get home.

676
00:35:48,718 --> 00:35:50,720
- If we ever want to be blue...
- Blue.

677
00:35:50,803 --> 00:35:52,680
...we've got to come up with
some way to get her talking.

678
00:35:52,763 --> 00:35:54,557
- Yeah.
- Got any ideas?

679
00:35:55,683 --> 00:35:58,018
I got it! Say "please."

680
00:35:58,102 --> 00:36:00,855
Never mind. I forgot you were you.

681
00:36:01,731 --> 00:36:03,691
- All right, here's my plan.
- Okay.

682
00:36:03,774 --> 00:36:06,777
We trick her into
acting like us, being naughty.

683
00:36:06,861 --> 00:36:07,903
Naughty, naughty!

684
00:36:07,987 --> 00:36:10,281
We use all her goodness against her.

685
00:36:10,364 --> 00:36:14,118
Once that happens,
she'll feel like she's part of our family!

686
00:36:14,285 --> 00:36:16,370
Family! I like family!

687
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:17,913
I love this plan!

688
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,165
- Oh, no!
- Broken family!

689
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:23,627
- Get her!
- Catch her! Catch Smurfette!

690
00:36:23,711 --> 00:36:25,588
See you later, Smurfigators!

691
00:36:25,755 --> 00:36:28,424
Father's gonna kill us! Go faster!

692
00:36:28,924 --> 00:36:32,178
- Au revoir, trolls!
- Get her!

693
00:36:32,261 --> 00:36:33,220
- Hello?
- Smurfette?

694
00:36:33,304 --> 00:36:34,555
- Where are you?
- Quick question.

695
00:36:34,638 --> 00:36:37,725
How is it we can't reach a doorknob,
but we can get up here?

696
00:36:37,808 --> 00:36:39,018
No, Clumsy, don't! No, no!

697
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,986
You just lost a fight to an empty room.

698
00:36:49,236 --> 00:36:51,071
Nobody wants to come up here

699
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:54,325
and play with the larger kitty
that they so annoyingly asked for!

700
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,451
You have to go! Now!

701
00:36:55,618 --> 00:36:57,578
- Yeah, soon as we get the Smurfette.
- Yeah!

702
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,789
- He coughs up everything he eats.
- You!

703
00:37:00,414 --> 00:37:03,125
Magic man, hand over the Smurfette.

704
00:37:03,626 --> 00:37:04,794
What did you just say?

705
00:37:05,002 --> 00:37:06,545
You heard me.

706
00:37:06,629 --> 00:37:08,923
Give me the Smurfette! Now!

707
00:37:09,089 --> 00:37:11,634
How dare you? Alaka...

708
00:37:11,842 --> 00:37:12,927
- Duck!
- ...duck!

709
00:37:14,345 --> 00:37:15,554
Duck?

710
00:37:20,476 --> 00:37:21,602
That was... up.

711
00:37:21,727 --> 00:37:23,229
No!

712
00:37:23,312 --> 00:37:24,313
You.

713
00:37:24,522 --> 00:37:27,691
By great Merlin's beard, I remember you!

714
00:37:30,152 --> 00:37:31,654
We meet again, eh?

715
00:37:31,737 --> 00:37:35,157
Daddy's flying! Daddy's flying!

716
00:37:37,535 --> 00:37:40,830
Well, well, well,
it appears we have a volunteer after all!

717
00:37:42,164 --> 00:37:45,042
Enough fooling around, yes?
Open wide, Azrael.

718
00:37:48,295 --> 00:37:50,005
Put him down, Gargafella!

719
00:37:53,217 --> 00:37:54,885
Leave my son alone!

720
00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:57,263
I'll teach you to mess with us Doyle ducks!

721
00:38:09,608 --> 00:38:10,609
You again!

722
00:38:10,776 --> 00:38:12,862
What are you doing? Put me down!

723
00:38:13,028 --> 00:38:14,029
Come on, Blue.

724
00:38:14,196 --> 00:38:16,574
Put me down! I could have taken him!
I had him!

725
00:38:18,784 --> 00:38:20,786
I'm afraid that's all the show
we have time for.

726
00:38:20,995 --> 00:38:22,454
Good bye.

727
00:38:22,538 --> 00:38:24,915
Go on, get out, get out, get out.

728
00:38:25,124 --> 00:38:27,167
Smurfette's hair. She's been here.

729
00:38:27,251 --> 00:38:29,169
Look! I found something.

730
00:38:29,253 --> 00:38:31,839
A portrait of perfection.

731
00:38:32,381 --> 00:38:34,633
Imagine how good you'd look
if you were actually helping.

732
00:38:34,717 --> 00:38:36,635
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

733
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:38,971
- Smurfette?
- Smurfette?

734
00:38:39,054 --> 00:38:40,264
Hey, is that coffee?

735
00:38:41,473 --> 00:38:43,475
Anyone else want a cup o' joe?

736
00:38:44,393 --> 00:38:46,645
Hey, what's that?

737
00:38:46,729 --> 00:38:48,564
It's a mirror, you barbarian.

738
00:38:48,647 --> 00:38:50,441
Snap out of it, Vanity, and push!

739
00:38:52,693 --> 00:38:54,153
Rage before beauty.

740
00:38:54,236 --> 00:38:56,739
Whatever this is,
it's making my butt scrunch.

741
00:38:57,364 --> 00:39:00,200
That's a little scary. I mean...

742
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:02,453
Gargamel!

743
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,708
Clumsy! Are you trying to get us smurfed?

744
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:10,169
It's some sort of magic window.

745
00:39:10,252 --> 00:39:12,046
Maybe it'll show us where Smurfette is.

746
00:39:13,088 --> 00:39:14,089
Naughties?

747
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,300
- Gargamel!
- Quickly, pick it up.

748
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,886
Quickly, to me, to me!

749
00:39:18,969 --> 00:39:21,347
Smurfette? Hello?

750
00:39:21,555 --> 00:39:23,474
Where did you go? Hello?

751
00:39:23,641 --> 00:39:25,309
- Move, Smurfs.
- Here he comes. Hurry.

752
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:27,144
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Where are you? Are you here?

753
00:39:27,603 --> 00:39:29,813
- Children? Smurfette?
- Back up, back up.

754
00:39:30,314 --> 00:39:31,607
Close the door! Close the door!

755
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,233
Your papa is back.

756
00:39:33,984 --> 00:39:35,194
Her papa?

757
00:39:35,277 --> 00:39:37,905
If this is a joke,
I assure you I don't find it funny.

758
00:39:38,781 --> 00:39:40,616
- Hello?
- Hold it!

759
00:39:40,824 --> 00:39:44,536
- Are you down there, you little delinquents?
- Keep still.

760
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,622
They must have retreated back to the hotel.

761
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,044
Of course we're running out of time.

762
00:39:52,127 --> 00:39:55,923
If that Patrick person is here,
then Papa cannot be far behind.

763
00:39:56,006 --> 00:39:59,009
Quickly, to the hotel!
We must get to her before he does.

764
00:40:03,472 --> 00:40:04,932
My face! My face!

765
00:40:05,015 --> 00:40:07,393
- What?
- It's gorgeous.

766
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,938
We fell, and it wasn't even my fault!

767
00:40:11,397 --> 00:40:13,148
Anyone? Anyone?

768
00:40:13,232 --> 00:40:17,069
Oh, my Smurf.

769
00:40:20,864 --> 00:40:22,950
I'm scrunching again.

770
00:40:23,784 --> 00:40:27,329
Papa, what does this
have to do with Smurfette?

771
00:40:27,413 --> 00:40:29,915
Everything, I'm afraid.

772
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:33,127
Why would he build such a hideous device?

773
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,754
Is that a giant Smurfalator?

774
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:37,673
To extract our essence.

775
00:40:38,382 --> 00:40:41,552
What are all those containers for?

776
00:40:41,635 --> 00:40:44,972
Ninety-nine bottles of Smurf on the wall.

777
00:40:45,055 --> 00:40:47,891
So if Smurfette gives him the formula...

778
00:40:47,975 --> 00:40:53,272
He can turn as many Naughties into Smurfs
as his greedy heart desires.

779
00:40:53,355 --> 00:40:55,024
Guys?

780
00:41:03,449 --> 00:41:04,533
Oh, dear.

781
00:41:06,744 --> 00:41:08,370
Need a catch, please.

782
00:41:12,082 --> 00:41:14,376
This place really needs to recycle.

783
00:41:14,793 --> 00:41:16,962
Think, Smurfette, think. Oh, no!

784
00:41:17,046 --> 00:41:19,214
- Where's Smurfette? Where's Smurfette?
- There she is!

785
00:41:19,298 --> 00:41:21,633
She's fast! I love this game!

786
00:41:21,717 --> 00:41:25,304
Wait! Let's let her run for a bit.
She's got nowhere to go.

787
00:41:25,387 --> 00:41:27,431
- This is perfect for my plan!
- Yeah, yeah.

788
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:30,225
What are you so cross about? I'm the duck!

789
00:41:30,392 --> 00:41:33,479
You always barge in and ruin everything!
You're like a walking disaster!

790
00:41:33,562 --> 00:41:35,230
Hey, look me in the eyes and say that.

791
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:38,734
- I can't.
- That's right, because it's not true.

792
00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:41,528
No, I can't because your eyes
are on the sides of your head!

793
00:41:42,446 --> 00:41:45,365
All the better for me
to see your disrespect!

794
00:41:46,408 --> 00:41:48,327
- What are you looking at?
- Hurry up.

795
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,287
It's global warming. Buy a Prius.

796
00:41:51,413 --> 00:41:53,665
Okay. Did I lose them?

797
00:41:57,586 --> 00:41:58,796
Good dog.

798
00:41:59,505 --> 00:42:02,257
No, no... Sorry. Excuse me.

799
00:42:03,926 --> 00:42:05,677
Okay, I got this.

800
00:42:16,271 --> 00:42:19,650
Papa, where are you?

801
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,113
Why am I not surprised the way out of
Gargamel's lair is through a sewer?

802
00:42:24,196 --> 00:42:25,781
- Master Winslow.
- Papa!

803
00:42:25,864 --> 00:42:27,616
- Patrick, look.
- What happened?

804
00:42:27,783 --> 00:42:30,953
Gargamel is hatching a
terrible, terrible plan.

805
00:42:32,162 --> 00:42:33,580
What's with the duck?

806
00:42:33,789 --> 00:42:35,833
That's Victor.
Gargamel turned him into a duck.

807
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:39,086
- Now Gargamel knows we're onto him.
- I was only trying to help!

808
00:42:39,294 --> 00:42:41,130
Victor, you look fowl.

809
00:42:41,755 --> 00:42:44,049
Yes, I did. Yes, I did.

810
00:42:44,299 --> 00:42:47,553
Focus, everyone.
We've got to find Smurfette quickly.

811
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:51,390
- There she is! Got her!
- Chase over?

812
00:42:52,182 --> 00:42:54,726
Hey, Hackus. See that candy store?

813
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:57,062
- Candy? Candy!
- I've got an idea.

814
00:42:57,312 --> 00:43:00,732
Go get yourself in trouble. Be naughty!
I'll take care of the rest.

815
00:43:00,816 --> 00:43:03,819
I love to make trouble!
Naughty, naughty, naughty!

816
00:43:05,779 --> 00:43:08,031
Hey, blondie. Where you going?

817
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,575
Leave me alone.

818
00:43:09,658 --> 00:43:12,161
You mean like your so-called Papa has?

819
00:43:12,661 --> 00:43:14,204
No, he hasn't!

820
00:43:15,372 --> 00:43:17,166
He will come for me.

821
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:23,046
He won't, because he knows
you're where you really belong.

822
00:43:23,755 --> 00:43:25,382
I didn't kidnap you, Smurfette.

823
00:43:25,966 --> 00:43:27,634
I brought you home.

824
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:32,306
I'm gonna make big trouble.

825
00:43:38,312 --> 00:43:40,439
Yummy candy!

826
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:49,573
Here comes trouble!

827
00:43:52,826 --> 00:43:54,286
Hello!

828
00:44:04,713 --> 00:44:08,508
Oh, my gosh!
He's gonna be killed! We have to help!

829
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,637
I thought you were supposed to be good.

830
00:44:11,845 --> 00:44:13,138
But...

831
00:44:13,597 --> 00:44:14,973
Help!

832
00:44:15,182 --> 00:44:16,516
Oh, smurf.

833
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,060
Okay, come on!

834
00:44:18,393 --> 00:44:21,480
Oh, no. I'm really in trouble now.

835
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,941
- Vexy!
- Oh, no! Hackus!

836
00:44:24,066 --> 00:44:25,192
Help!

837
00:44:25,317 --> 00:44:26,735
Help Hackus.

838
00:44:28,403 --> 00:44:30,530
Smurfette, what are we gonna do?

839
00:44:31,073 --> 00:44:33,075
Vexy, give me a lift! Come on, jump!

840
00:44:36,078 --> 00:44:38,247
- Bull's-eye!
- Holy smurf!

841
00:44:38,413 --> 00:44:41,500
- Good one, Smurfette!
- Blend that, candy man!

842
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,793
Come on, Hackus!

843
00:44:44,544 --> 00:44:46,713
Vexy, let's go!

844
00:44:50,592 --> 00:44:51,760
Hold on!

845
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:53,553
Look out!

846
00:44:53,762 --> 00:44:55,639
Nice move, stealing a cart.

847
00:44:55,847 --> 00:44:57,975
I didn't exactly steal it.

848
00:44:58,684 --> 00:45:00,602
- Sorry!
- Well, it's not yours, is it?

849
00:45:00,686 --> 00:45:01,937
Naughty, naughty, naughty.

850
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,106
See? You're just like us.

851
00:45:05,607 --> 00:45:09,861
How am I going to get Smurfette
to give me that formula, Azrael?

852
00:45:09,945 --> 00:45:12,114
This whole thing just makes me want to...

853
00:45:12,823 --> 00:45:15,158
Cry? No. Flush her down the toilet bowl.

854
00:45:15,242 --> 00:45:16,827
There must be something we can do.

855
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:20,622
I know you only have a tiny little
pea-sized brain in there, but think!

856
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:24,167
Is it her birthday? Really? Who cares?

857
00:45:25,919 --> 00:45:28,255
A present? A cake?

858
00:45:28,338 --> 00:45:29,381
Be nice to her?

859
00:45:32,676 --> 00:45:37,306
Bribery and flattery
to soften her stony little heart, eh?

860
00:45:37,389 --> 00:45:40,434
That's counterintuitive,
but that just might work.

861
00:45:41,143 --> 00:45:43,186
I'm so glad I thought of this!

862
00:45:44,146 --> 00:45:45,605
Let's see...

863
00:45:46,356 --> 00:45:47,357
All right, all right.

864
00:45:47,566 --> 00:45:49,067
What kind of gift should I get her?

865
00:45:49,234 --> 00:45:51,320
- Kitty, kitty, kitty!
- Hey, fish breath!

866
00:45:53,488 --> 00:45:55,532
Not now, Azrael, I'm trying to think of

867
00:45:55,615 --> 00:45:58,910
a genuine and heartfelt gift
that I can deceive that Smurfette with!

868
00:45:58,994 --> 00:46:00,329
I said not now!

869
00:46:01,496 --> 00:46:05,042
Not now! Not now! Not now!
Not now! Not now! Not now!

870
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,836
You are walking home.

871
00:46:09,338 --> 00:46:10,339
Cats.

872
00:46:12,341 --> 00:46:13,508
Faster! Faster!

873
00:46:13,633 --> 00:46:14,593
Excuse us! Sorry!

874
00:46:14,676 --> 00:46:16,178
How are we gonna stop this thing?

875
00:46:16,636 --> 00:46:18,680
I don't think that's gonna be a problem!

876
00:46:19,598 --> 00:46:21,683
And she sticks the landing!

877
00:46:25,228 --> 00:46:28,315
- Yummy pudding!
- Hackus, it's mud.

878
00:46:28,398 --> 00:46:30,025
Yummy mud!

879
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,238
Take your best shot, cat!

880
00:46:35,989 --> 00:46:37,032
Watch out!

881
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:41,411
Yes!

882
00:46:41,578 --> 00:46:43,538
- Nice shot! Let's go!
- Nice shot! Let's go!

883
00:46:44,081 --> 00:46:45,957
- Come on!
- Move it or lose it, Hackus!

884
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:49,211
Oh, no! Angry kitty! Angry kitty! Run!

885
00:46:49,669 --> 00:46:51,546
Okay, ladies, act pregnant.

886
00:46:51,671 --> 00:46:52,839
- This way, guys!
- Faster!

887
00:46:52,923 --> 00:46:54,716
- It's time to get your wings!
- Faster!

888
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,051
Quick, get on the storks!

889
00:46:56,218 --> 00:46:57,344
Let's go!

890
00:46:57,427 --> 00:46:58,428
Wait, where's Hackus?

891
00:46:59,429 --> 00:47:00,931
Fly, big stork, fly!

892
00:47:01,431 --> 00:47:03,809
Here comes kitty! Look out!

893
00:47:04,434 --> 00:47:06,395
Come on, Hackus! Let's go!

894
00:47:08,855 --> 00:47:10,190
Yeah!

895
00:47:10,732 --> 00:47:13,026
Hey, look, it's a catfish!

896
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:15,278
Bye, kitty!

897
00:47:16,238 --> 00:47:18,490
This is amazing!

898
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:22,160
Stork going backwards!
Stork going backwards!

899
00:47:26,123 --> 00:47:28,917
This is so beautiful!

900
00:47:30,419 --> 00:47:32,337
I'm falling! I'm falling!

901
00:47:33,922 --> 00:47:36,007
Smurfette's my hero!

902
00:47:37,843 --> 00:47:39,553
- How did it go?
- Couldn't have gone better.

903
00:47:39,636 --> 00:47:42,264
Except that everything
was a complete smurftastrophe.

904
00:47:43,098 --> 00:47:44,474
It's Smurfy's Law.

905
00:47:44,558 --> 00:47:46,810
Well, I have some good news.

906
00:47:46,893 --> 00:47:52,399
I borrowed a waiter's outfit for you, complete
with a security card for the elevator.

907
00:47:52,607 --> 00:47:53,608
How did you manage that?

908
00:47:53,942 --> 00:47:57,070
Let's just say that the Plaza Athénée
laundry room was paid a little visit

909
00:47:57,237 --> 00:48:01,199
by international apparel
inspector Mademoiselle Doolittle.

910
00:48:01,283 --> 00:48:03,160
I was like Meryl smurfin' Streep.

911
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:05,745
Good job, Grace!

912
00:48:05,871 --> 00:48:08,331
Does everyone get a new outfit,
or just Patrick?

913
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:11,084
- Bloody window.
- What was that?

914
00:48:11,251 --> 00:48:12,210
That's Victor.

915
00:48:12,294 --> 00:48:15,714
They wouldn't let him through the lobby,
so he flew up.

916
00:48:16,923 --> 00:48:18,800
No depth perception.

917
00:48:18,967 --> 00:48:20,802
Grandpa Vicster is a duck!

918
00:48:21,136 --> 00:48:22,304
Gargamel zapped him.

919
00:48:22,762 --> 00:48:23,805
You can change him back, right?

920
00:48:24,347 --> 00:48:26,516
No, but it's a transformation spell.

921
00:48:26,725 --> 00:48:28,143
It'll wear off eventually.

922
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:30,562
Everybody relax. It's not a problem.

923
00:48:30,645 --> 00:48:33,148
But if you see me lay an egg,
it's just between us.

924
00:48:35,108 --> 00:48:36,818
You don't seem too upset about this.

925
00:48:36,985 --> 00:48:39,196
It's not in a duck's nature to get upset.

926
00:48:39,279 --> 00:48:41,865
We like to let things roll off our backs.

927
00:48:42,032 --> 00:48:44,242
Seriously? You seriously just said that?

928
00:48:44,409 --> 00:48:47,162
- I like that. That's very smurfy of you.
- Very smurfy.

929
00:48:47,245 --> 00:48:48,538
Why, thank you. See?

930
00:48:48,747 --> 00:48:50,749
The little Santa Claus
Smurf appreciates me.

931
00:48:50,832 --> 00:48:54,711
Maybe someday, Patrick, you'll learn to
appreciate my smurfy qualities, too!

932
00:48:54,961 --> 00:48:56,922
Okay. I've... There's... You know...

933
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,882
I'm not having this
conversation with a duck.

934
00:49:00,675 --> 00:49:02,427
Now I'm catching a cold.

935
00:49:02,511 --> 00:49:03,762
I wish I had a cold.

936
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:06,097
I've had Hefty's crystal
shoved down my throat,

937
00:49:06,181 --> 00:49:09,017
got attacked as a corn dog,
fell down a sewer,

938
00:49:09,226 --> 00:49:11,520
and if that wasn't smelly enough,

939
00:49:11,686 --> 00:49:15,690
had to travel by armpit just to find
out we're all gonna be extinct!

940
00:49:16,525 --> 00:49:20,403
- Holy smurf, I'm a downer.
- You most certainly are.

941
00:49:20,654 --> 00:49:25,659
Grouchy, the only way we'll be extinct is if
Smurfette gives Gargamel the secret formula.

942
00:49:25,825 --> 00:49:27,994
- But Smurfette would never tell.
- Of course not.

943
00:49:28,078 --> 00:49:29,287
- Never.
- Absolutely not.

944
00:49:29,371 --> 00:49:32,249
Smurfette could never be
tricked into being one of them.

945
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:34,501
Hey, Smurfette.

946
00:49:34,584 --> 00:49:37,045
Did you do this
with your sisters back in Smurf Village?

947
00:49:37,128 --> 00:49:40,632
Lots of flying, but I never had a sister.

948
00:49:40,715 --> 00:49:42,384
Well, you do now.

949
00:49:42,467 --> 00:49:45,053
- Want to race?
- You want to race me?

950
00:49:45,845 --> 00:49:47,722
You're in trouble now!

951
00:49:49,432 --> 00:49:51,601
- I'm gonna lose you, Smurfette.
- Not a chance.

952
00:50:01,278 --> 00:50:03,154
Watch out!

953
00:50:03,238 --> 00:50:04,823
Hold on tight, Hackus.

954
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,784
- Not that tight, Hackus.
- Sorry.

955
00:50:07,951 --> 00:50:09,828
Stork fight!

956
00:50:10,745 --> 00:50:12,205
Coming through!

957
00:50:13,081 --> 00:50:14,749
This is insane!

958
00:50:16,251 --> 00:50:18,420
Smurf, smurf, and away.

959
00:50:20,005 --> 00:50:22,424
Hackus, king of world!

960
00:50:23,717 --> 00:50:25,510
You're playing dirty now!

961
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:27,387
I'm just getting started.

962
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:28,972
Go, go!

963
00:50:29,097 --> 00:50:31,057
I call that a Crepe Smurfette.

964
00:50:32,851 --> 00:50:34,811
Snails to go?

965
00:50:35,937 --> 00:50:37,981
- Batter up!
- Come on!

966
00:50:38,106 --> 00:50:40,191
Hit me with your best shot.

967
00:50:42,819 --> 00:50:43,820
Snailed her!

968
00:50:43,903 --> 00:50:46,031
- You are naughty, Smurfette.
- Yeah.

969
00:50:50,243 --> 00:50:53,622
Hey! I've seen that lady before.

970
00:50:53,705 --> 00:50:55,332
She's beautiful.

971
00:50:55,415 --> 00:50:58,460
They've got one of these everywhere.

972
00:50:59,127 --> 00:51:00,545
I'm gonna strangle that duck.

973
00:51:00,629 --> 00:51:02,672
Vic's like a black cloud
that follows me around.

974
00:51:04,049 --> 00:51:05,133
Okay, look, I get it.

975
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,135
But you know what, he's here, isn't he?

976
00:51:07,302 --> 00:51:08,553
He shows up.

977
00:51:08,637 --> 00:51:10,513
Yeah, whether you want him to or not.

978
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,141
Okay, I always heard that
showing up was 90% of the job.

979
00:51:13,642 --> 00:51:15,393
A lot of fathers don't even do that.

980
00:51:15,727 --> 00:51:17,312
He's not my father.

981
00:51:17,562 --> 00:51:19,397
Well, that's too bad.

982
00:51:19,481 --> 00:51:21,816
'Cause that pretty much
leaves you without one.

983
00:51:35,163 --> 00:51:36,831
- Patrick.
- All right, guys.

984
00:51:36,998 --> 00:51:38,541
- Game on.
- Let's do this!

985
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:40,752
- I'm gonna stay with Blue.
- And Vic.

986
00:51:40,835 --> 00:51:43,338
Okay, Smurfs, off to Gargamel's hotel.

987
00:51:43,421 --> 00:51:44,964
Patrick,
there's actually something I'd like to...

988
00:51:45,048 --> 00:51:46,132
No "actuallys."

989
00:51:46,341 --> 00:51:47,425
You're staying here.

990
00:51:47,592 --> 00:51:48,885
That's not what I was even going...

991
00:51:49,052 --> 00:51:50,637
Victor, don't make me pluck you.

992
00:51:50,804 --> 00:51:52,138
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

993
00:51:52,305 --> 00:51:56,101
We're gonna get Smurfette this time,
100% guaranteed.

994
00:51:56,309 --> 00:51:57,852
What did you just say, Grouchy?

995
00:51:58,061 --> 00:52:03,024
You heard it. I'm tired of being Grouchy.
I am changing my tune to a happy one.

996
00:52:03,191 --> 00:52:05,068
From now on, lam...

997
00:52:05,193 --> 00:52:07,654
Ready? Positive Smurf.

998
00:52:07,737 --> 00:52:09,906
I sprained my face.

999
00:52:10,115 --> 00:52:12,450
You'll get used to it. Let's go, Smurfs.

1000
00:52:12,951 --> 00:52:14,786
- Come on. Come on.
- A paper bag. First-class.

1001
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:16,746
- Hurry...
- Clumsy!

1002
00:52:17,455 --> 00:52:19,207
Good luck, Daddy!

1003
00:52:21,626 --> 00:52:23,169
Le chat VIP.

1004
00:52:23,253 --> 00:52:25,839
Please, I will take you to your room.

1005
00:52:30,969 --> 00:52:33,805
- Front desk.
- Listen well, you slack-jawed knave.

1006
00:52:33,888 --> 00:52:34,973
Monsieur Gargamel.

1007
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:39,811
I want ale, curds and blistered meats
sent into my room in 10 minutes,

1008
00:52:39,894 --> 00:52:43,231
or I will turn you into
a legless tree sloth.

1009
00:52:44,232 --> 00:52:47,026
How was that, Smurfs?

1010
00:52:47,861 --> 00:52:48,945
That's not funny, man.

1011
00:52:54,743 --> 00:52:58,705
Duck, duck, duck.

1012
00:52:59,289 --> 00:53:00,707
Goose!

1013
00:53:04,043 --> 00:53:07,088
The security card for the elevator.
Patrick needs my help.

1014
00:53:08,757 --> 00:53:13,511
When I show up with this, he'll see
this black cloud has got a silver...

1015
00:53:13,928 --> 00:53:15,555
A silver lining!

1016
00:53:28,777 --> 00:53:30,570
Oh, my...

1017
00:53:30,653 --> 00:53:32,113
Master Winslow, please.

1018
00:53:32,197 --> 00:53:33,740
- You can't get a reservation...
- Focus.

1019
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,450
That smells delish!

1020
00:53:38,244 --> 00:53:39,662
Le bingo.

1021
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:47,545
Okay, guys, listen, when you get to
the room, if there's any problems...

1022
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:52,300
- Snot on a half shell. Delicacy.
- Sorry, Mr Fish!

1023
00:53:53,134 --> 00:53:54,469
You look fried.

1024
00:53:54,552 --> 00:53:56,137
Like I said, if there are any problems...

1025
00:53:56,346 --> 00:53:58,264
My friend,
there are no such thing as problems.

1026
00:53:58,348 --> 00:53:59,974
Only smurfitunities.

1027
00:54:00,058 --> 00:54:02,477
- You're freaking me out, Grouchy.
- Positive!

1028
00:54:02,644 --> 00:54:04,187
Of...

1029
00:54:10,485 --> 00:54:12,403
Okay, guys, we're in.

1030
00:54:12,487 --> 00:54:14,447
Patrick Winslow-Doyle.

1031
00:54:15,949 --> 00:54:17,116
Patrick.

1032
00:54:18,701 --> 00:54:21,663
- What are you doing here?
- Saving your tail feather. Now come here.

1033
00:54:21,788 --> 00:54:23,331
I've got something
you need for your mission.

1034
00:54:23,498 --> 00:54:24,666
Hurry up. There's no time to argue.

1035
00:54:26,668 --> 00:54:28,878
- What?
- It's the security card for the elevator.

1036
00:54:29,087 --> 00:54:31,214
I have the security card.

1037
00:54:31,673 --> 00:54:34,676
What is this? This is our room key.

1038
00:54:36,636 --> 00:54:39,138
Well, now when you come back,
you'll be able to get in.

1039
00:54:39,347 --> 00:54:40,557
- No problem.
- I can't...

1040
00:54:40,974 --> 00:54:41,975
No, no, no, no, no.

1041
00:54:43,184 --> 00:54:44,269
You're welcome.

1042
00:54:44,435 --> 00:54:46,437
You can thank me later.

1043
00:54:46,521 --> 00:54:48,022
How did you get out?

1044
00:54:48,189 --> 00:54:49,440
Now, you just put me back down.

1045
00:54:49,524 --> 00:54:50,733
Patrick, help!

1046
00:54:50,942 --> 00:54:53,570
- We need you for our duck a l'orange.
- You want a piece of me?

1047
00:54:53,736 --> 00:54:55,822
No, no, no, no! That's not what I meant.

1048
00:54:55,905 --> 00:54:59,200
Yeah, it starts with the ducks,
and soon, no one's safe!

1049
00:54:59,576 --> 00:55:01,661
- Unbelievable.
- Patrick!

1050
00:55:04,497 --> 00:55:05,498
Master Winslow?

1051
00:55:05,582 --> 00:55:07,417
- Patrick!
- Where'd he go?

1052
00:55:07,792 --> 00:55:09,294
- He disappeared.
- Now we're on our own.

1053
00:55:09,377 --> 00:55:10,795
- Well...
- Hide!

1054
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:14,132
Monsieur Gargamel.

1055
00:55:19,971 --> 00:55:22,432
We're smurfed. Plan B, anybody?

1056
00:55:22,515 --> 00:55:24,684
I'm struggling to remain positive here.

1057
00:55:30,231 --> 00:55:32,150
Monsieur Gargamel?

1058
00:55:33,026 --> 00:55:34,110
Room service.

1059
00:55:36,738 --> 00:55:38,406
Hello, kitty.

1060
00:55:38,907 --> 00:55:40,074
Here is your room service.

1061
00:55:40,241 --> 00:55:44,037
- What do we do?
- Smurf him with the element of surprise.

1062
00:55:44,996 --> 00:55:46,623
Oh, Clumsy!

1063
00:55:48,499 --> 00:55:49,667
- Oh, dear.
- Now what do we do?

1064
00:55:50,752 --> 00:55:52,086
Just act scary.

1065
00:55:52,253 --> 00:55:53,546
What?

1066
00:55:53,671 --> 00:55:56,090
I'm a scary ghost!

1067
00:55:56,382 --> 00:55:57,425
Nice.

1068
00:55:58,885 --> 00:56:01,638
Why do so many bad things
happen to little blue people?

1069
00:56:01,804 --> 00:56:03,640
Positive, positive.

1070
00:56:03,848 --> 00:56:07,310
Window! Window! Window!

1071
00:56:10,104 --> 00:56:13,024
Oh, no!

1072
00:56:13,566 --> 00:56:16,194
Are you smurfing kidding me?
You nearly killed...

1073
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:19,280
I mean, look at this view.

1074
00:56:23,701 --> 00:56:29,666
If it looks like a duck, quacks like a
duck, and smells like a corn dog...

1075
00:56:29,874 --> 00:56:31,876
All right, which one of you is Vic?

1076
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,795
What, you don't recognise your own father?

1077
00:56:35,421 --> 00:56:37,882
- Let's go.
- What about my brothers?

1078
00:56:37,966 --> 00:56:39,801
We can't just leave them here to be eaten.

1079
00:56:39,968 --> 00:56:41,219
You just met them.

1080
00:56:41,469 --> 00:56:44,305
This is my flock.
I can't just leave them behind.

1081
00:56:44,806 --> 00:56:47,183
Come on, if you're game, so am I.

1082
00:56:50,186 --> 00:56:52,563
I am covered in filth.

1083
00:56:52,772 --> 00:56:55,066
I look like something the cat dragged in!

1084
00:56:57,819 --> 00:56:59,904
Come on, it's not that bad.

1085
00:57:00,154 --> 00:57:02,281
Although, if I don't... The cat!

1086
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:05,660
- Not the face. Not the face!
- Close the lid!

1087
00:57:08,121 --> 00:57:10,373
- That was awesome!
- Thank you!

1088
00:57:10,832 --> 00:57:13,001
Hackus lives!

1089
00:57:13,084 --> 00:57:14,335
Vexy, come and help me close the door.

1090
00:57:14,502 --> 00:57:16,087
- Thank you, bird.
- Bye.

1091
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,922
That was crazy.

1092
00:57:19,048 --> 00:57:21,926
Bye-bye, birds. I had fun.

1093
00:57:22,343 --> 00:57:23,344
Yeah.

1094
00:57:23,553 --> 00:57:25,555
- High fours!
- High fours!

1095
00:57:25,638 --> 00:57:28,099
Hackus, Hackus, Hackus.

1096
00:57:28,182 --> 00:57:30,351
It's so nice having another girl around.

1097
00:57:32,937 --> 00:57:33,938
What are you doing?

1098
00:57:34,439 --> 00:57:37,025
Rm just hugging you.

1099
00:57:37,692 --> 00:57:39,902
Haven't you ever been hugged?

1100
00:57:43,531 --> 00:57:45,116
Vexy...

1101
00:57:49,871 --> 00:57:52,874
- Hackus hug. Hackus hug.
- Hackus.

1102
00:57:52,957 --> 00:57:54,792
Hackus squeeze!

1103
00:57:54,876 --> 00:57:56,210
Hackus.

1104
00:57:56,377 --> 00:57:58,963
I'm positive we should
just leave him in here.

1105
00:57:59,047 --> 00:58:00,048
Thanks.

1106
00:58:00,298 --> 00:58:04,260
Hurry. They're probably doing something
mean and horrible to her right now.

1107
00:58:04,427 --> 00:58:07,764
Yeah, Smurfette needs us.
She's probably scared and...

1108
00:58:09,265 --> 00:58:11,350
- I love family!
- What...

1109
00:58:11,893 --> 00:58:13,227
What is she doing?

1110
00:58:13,311 --> 00:58:15,313
I think they're hugging.

1111
00:58:15,396 --> 00:58:16,564
Papa?

1112
00:58:16,773 --> 00:58:18,316
Hackus love to hug.

1113
00:58:18,399 --> 00:58:19,776
Hackus.

1114
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:22,403
Smurfette, come on,
I got to show you something.

1115
00:58:23,446 --> 00:58:27,158
Look at us. Come on, tell
me we're not family.

1116
00:58:28,701 --> 00:58:30,953
Smurfette!

1117
00:58:31,037 --> 00:58:32,163
Over here!

1118
00:58:32,246 --> 00:58:33,289
Smurfette!

1119
00:58:33,372 --> 00:58:36,417
I'm sorry Papa Smurf didn't come for you.

1120
00:58:36,501 --> 00:58:41,005
But maybe your place is here with us.

1121
00:58:42,507 --> 00:58:43,966
Yeah.

1122
00:58:44,383 --> 00:58:45,593
Maybe it is.

1123
00:58:46,094 --> 00:58:48,262
Why is she being nice to them?

1124
00:58:48,471 --> 00:58:52,100
She's just identifying with her captors.
It's classic Smurf-holm syndrome.

1125
00:58:52,266 --> 00:58:56,395
No, she thinks we don't care anymore,
and they do.

1126
00:58:56,479 --> 00:58:57,772
She's confused.

1127
00:58:58,106 --> 00:59:01,150
Clumsy, Grouchy, get up there,
and help me get this door open.

1128
00:59:01,234 --> 00:59:02,318
- That's my daughter in there!
- Okay, Papa.

1129
00:59:02,401 --> 00:59:05,530
- I'll get on top.
- Okay, Grouchy, you jump, I'll pull.

1130
00:59:05,613 --> 00:59:08,074
- Come on, we can do this.
- Children.

1131
00:59:08,241 --> 00:59:11,285
- Gargamel!
- Clumsy, don't let go...

1132
00:59:11,786 --> 00:59:13,204
Daddy's home.

1133
00:59:13,287 --> 00:59:18,251
And consistent with his kind nature,
he brought you a present.

1134
00:59:18,459 --> 00:59:19,585
Grouchy, get down. He'll see you.

1135
00:59:19,669 --> 00:59:21,963
- How are we gonna rescue her now?
- Quiet.

1136
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,757
I do believe
we got off on the wrong foot earlier.

1137
00:59:24,841 --> 00:59:25,883
What's happening?

1138
00:59:25,967 --> 00:59:29,720
Would you allow me to wish you
a very, very happy birthday?

1139
00:59:30,638 --> 00:59:32,265
It seems like only yesterday

1140
00:59:32,348 --> 00:59:36,602
you were just my little glob of clay
and other putrid ingredients.

1141
00:59:36,811 --> 00:59:40,398
You remembered my birthday?

1142
00:59:40,481 --> 00:59:42,900
Of course I did. We're family.

1143
00:59:43,067 --> 00:59:44,485
- What?
- But we're her family.

1144
00:59:44,569 --> 00:59:47,363
- Families don't forget things like that.
- Does she think we abandoned her?

1145
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:51,075
Speaking of which, your little blue
step-papa never did arrive, now did he?

1146
00:59:51,159 --> 00:59:52,493
Step-Papa?

1147
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:55,997
Why, I am truly sorry, my dear.
That must really sting.

1148
00:59:57,373 --> 01:00:01,627
I remember when my father
threw me down the well for the first time.

1149
01:00:02,545 --> 01:00:07,967
The disappointed look on his face
when I finally managed to claw my way out.

1150
01:00:09,385 --> 01:00:12,138
Anyway, happy birthday, my dear.

1151
01:00:12,221 --> 01:00:13,890
- Happy birthday, Smurfette!
- Happy birthday, Smurfette!

1152
01:00:14,015 --> 01:00:16,475
- I want to open! Let me open!
- No, no, no.

1153
01:00:16,684 --> 01:00:17,852
Ugly.

1154
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:25,526
"Bow. Kneel. Worship me."

1155
01:00:27,361 --> 01:00:30,531
Yes, delightful rendition, really.

1156
01:00:30,615 --> 01:00:32,783
Keep it up, no-neck,
I'll turn you into a cross-eyed newt.

1157
01:00:34,035 --> 01:00:36,954
Yes, yes, my dear.

1158
01:00:37,038 --> 01:00:38,539
Go ahead, take it.

1159
01:00:38,706 --> 01:00:42,877
It's a tiny little magical wand
of your very own.

1160
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,880
Go ahead. It's your birthday present.

1161
01:00:50,426 --> 01:00:51,886
No.

1162
01:00:52,011 --> 01:00:53,512
Don't do it.

1163
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,600
Do you like it?

1164
01:00:58,893 --> 01:01:02,271
Silly me. I've forgotten to turn it on.

1165
01:01:03,314 --> 01:01:05,107
Here we are.

1166
01:01:05,733 --> 01:01:09,028
Yes, there we go.

1167
01:01:12,949 --> 01:01:15,743
Yes, go ahead, try it out. Don't be afraid.

1168
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:17,954
- A Dragon Wand.
- Oh, dear.

1169
01:01:18,204 --> 01:01:21,082
After all, it is your birthright.

1170
01:01:22,541 --> 01:01:24,377
How do you know I won't use it on you?

1171
01:01:25,461 --> 01:01:26,587
Well...

1172
01:01:26,671 --> 01:01:31,092
Because, Smurfette, I am your father.

1173
01:01:31,175 --> 01:01:34,303
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

1174
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:37,014
- She's gonna zap him.
- Get him, Smurfette.

1175
01:01:37,223 --> 01:01:38,516
Smurfette...

1176
01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:40,518
Sing The La La Song.

1177
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:46,774
Sing it!

1178
01:01:50,569 --> 01:01:52,238
This is good, right, Papa?

1179
01:01:52,321 --> 01:01:54,824
No! She's becoming one of them!

1180
01:01:54,949 --> 01:01:57,576
I have always wanted to do this!

1181
01:02:00,997 --> 01:02:02,331
We're losing her.

1182
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:05,835
- Yes! Good one, Smurfette.
- Your first cat zap.

1183
01:02:05,918 --> 01:02:08,504
Look at you. Look at you.

1184
01:02:10,256 --> 01:02:14,302
You truly are daddy's little girl.

1185
01:02:14,802 --> 01:02:16,762
- Smurfette!
- No, Papa! Grouchy, grab him!

1186
01:02:16,971 --> 01:02:18,556
- No, Papa, he's gonna see you!
- Get him down!

1187
01:02:18,764 --> 01:02:20,349
- Clumsy, help, help me get him down!
- Papa, no!

1188
01:02:20,975 --> 01:02:22,685
Yeah!

1189
01:02:29,317 --> 01:02:31,652
No!

1190
01:02:33,863 --> 01:02:37,742
Take to the skies, lads.
Free at last! Free at last!

1191
01:02:37,825 --> 01:02:40,328
- What are you, Martin Luther Wing?
- That's it.

1192
01:02:40,494 --> 01:02:45,041
Joke it up, funny boy, but I am proud
as a peacock to be a freedom flighter.

1193
01:02:45,666 --> 01:02:46,709
Oh, no.

1194
01:02:46,876 --> 01:02:48,669
What the... is that?

1195
01:02:50,379 --> 01:02:52,840
Hang on, Smurfs! Victor's on the way!

1196
01:02:53,007 --> 01:02:54,884
Pop your smurf-chutes.

1197
01:02:54,967 --> 01:02:56,218
The flying V!

1198
01:02:56,427 --> 01:02:58,262
Gotcha.

1199
01:02:59,138 --> 01:03:00,264
Okay, don't panic.

1200
01:03:00,348 --> 01:03:02,350
That is a lot of white meat.

1201
01:03:03,142 --> 01:03:04,560
Now panic!

1202
01:03:04,852 --> 01:03:06,395
Me no likey!

1203
01:03:12,234 --> 01:03:13,277
That was brilliant.

1204
01:03:13,944 --> 01:03:15,863
- He's naked, right?
- Everyone okay?

1205
01:03:16,072 --> 01:03:19,075
Help me, somebody.
Somebody please, let me out!

1206
01:03:21,035 --> 01:03:24,580
I have seen unspeakable things down there.

1207
01:03:25,206 --> 01:03:27,666
I have been scarred for life.

1208
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:31,045
Where's Smurfette?

1209
01:03:33,047 --> 01:03:35,007
- She's...
- Where's Smurfette?

1210
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:38,761
We were too late.

1211
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,056
Nice going.

1212
01:03:45,476 --> 01:03:49,772
Have fun, children.
Just remember, be kind to each other.

1213
01:03:49,855 --> 01:03:52,066
Will you get away from me,
you bumbling moron?

1214
01:03:52,149 --> 01:03:53,818
- Where are they?
- What?

1215
01:03:53,901 --> 01:03:56,737
Smurfs were here? In this room?
Why didn't you say so?

1216
01:03:56,904 --> 01:03:58,489
Right now!

1217
01:04:00,533 --> 01:04:01,575
She must not learn of this.

1218
01:04:01,951 --> 01:04:06,914
We must spirit her away from here
and get that formula now.

1219
01:04:07,373 --> 01:04:10,418
Smurfette, my dear,
are you ready to go celebrate?

1220
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:12,169
- Yeah!
- Come on, come on. This'll be fun.

1221
01:04:14,296 --> 01:04:15,423
We were this close to
getting Smurfette back.

1222
01:04:15,506 --> 01:04:16,507
I know.

1223
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:19,385
He distracted me
at the worst possible moment, Grace.

1224
01:04:19,468 --> 01:04:21,262
I would have been in the elevator
if it wasn't for him.

1225
01:04:21,345 --> 01:04:24,098
Okay, okay, use your indoor voice,
and please, Patrick, just breathe.

1226
01:04:24,223 --> 01:04:25,850
I want him gone.

1227
01:04:25,933 --> 01:04:28,727
- He's your dad.
- No, that's one thing he is not.

1228
01:04:28,811 --> 01:04:31,105
He's right, Grace. I'm not his father.

1229
01:04:32,481 --> 01:04:34,650
His real father left and
started a new family.

1230
01:04:35,776 --> 01:04:37,403
He's been chewed up about it ever since.

1231
01:04:38,237 --> 01:04:40,156
- Excuse me?
- As well you might.

1232
01:04:40,364 --> 01:04:43,826
But I can't take the brunt of it anymore.

1233
01:04:44,034 --> 01:04:47,538
Hey, I never asked
for you to come barging into my life, okay?

1234
01:04:47,788 --> 01:04:51,542
I didn't ask you to
marry my mother or take away Zeus.

1235
01:04:51,876 --> 01:04:54,086
Zeus? The pigeon?

1236
01:04:54,795 --> 01:04:56,255
The parrot.

1237
01:04:56,338 --> 01:04:57,923
My parrot.

1238
01:04:58,007 --> 01:05:01,093
Taken away because you were allergic.

1239
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,140
I was not allergic to that bird, Patrick.

1240
01:05:06,348 --> 01:05:07,475
Yes, you were.

1241
01:05:08,309 --> 01:05:10,519
No, I wasn't.

1242
01:05:10,603 --> 01:05:11,645
You were.

1243
01:05:12,313 --> 01:05:13,647
What?

1244
01:05:13,856 --> 01:05:17,026
It got so bad, every day,
you were wheezing, coughing.

1245
01:05:17,401 --> 01:05:19,570
Your mother and I both knew
that it would break your heart

1246
01:05:19,653 --> 01:05:22,198
to think the bird
had to go away because of you.

1247
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:24,742
You already blamed yourself for your dad.

1248
01:05:24,825 --> 01:05:26,076
So I took the heat.

1249
01:05:26,952 --> 01:05:30,498
That's a lie. What are you...
I'm not allergic to birds.

1250
01:05:31,165 --> 01:05:32,917
Okay, tell you what.

1251
01:05:33,501 --> 01:05:34,502
Sniff my feathers.

1252
01:05:34,877 --> 01:05:37,213
- I'm not going to...
- Come on, sniff them.

1253
01:05:43,928 --> 01:05:45,012
Truth itches, doesn't it?

1254
01:05:49,892 --> 01:05:51,977
Listen to me, Patrick.

1255
01:05:52,061 --> 01:05:54,355
I loved your mother with all my heart.

1256
01:05:54,522 --> 01:05:57,816
I took care of Jeannette,
and I made her happy.

1257
01:05:58,067 --> 01:06:00,778
I also chose to love you as my own.

1258
01:06:00,861 --> 01:06:02,363
Now, I didn't have to do that.

1259
01:06:02,446 --> 01:06:07,743
But you were this little kid, no father, no
hope in his eyes, a big hole in his heart,

1260
01:06:07,826 --> 01:06:09,370
so I gave you everything I could.

1261
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:11,914
But I'm done, you know?

1262
01:06:11,997 --> 01:06:14,500
You don't want it, that's fine.

1263
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,002
My last word of advice to you is this...

1264
01:06:18,003 --> 01:06:19,171
Will you grow up?

1265
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:22,716
Stop blaming everyone else for your pain.

1266
01:06:22,883 --> 01:06:24,009
And whatever you do,

1267
01:06:24,093 --> 01:06:29,682
don't teach that beautiful son of yours that
love is conditional, because it is not.

1268
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:33,394
Good bye, Grace.

1269
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:40,067
Bye-bye, Blue.

1270
01:06:49,326 --> 01:06:51,328
Grandpa Vicster.

1271
01:06:55,165 --> 01:06:56,166
Bye.

1272
01:06:59,795 --> 01:07:01,547
Goodbye, Patrick Winslow.

1273
01:07:11,807 --> 01:07:14,435
Look at that big wheel.

1274
01:07:14,518 --> 01:07:17,313
Come. Come along, my dear.

1275
01:07:17,605 --> 01:07:20,691
So this is why they call
it the City of Light.

1276
01:07:21,775 --> 01:07:23,402
There's a lot of people.

1277
01:07:23,652 --> 01:07:25,529
Yes, well...

1278
01:07:25,613 --> 01:07:28,866
I prefer to call them "worshippers."

1279
01:07:28,949 --> 01:07:30,367
"Worshippers."

1280
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,953
Alakakneel!

1281
01:07:34,288 --> 01:07:37,124
Bow. Kneel.

1282
01:07:38,083 --> 01:07:39,418
Hackus.

1283
01:07:39,501 --> 01:07:41,545
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

1284
01:07:41,629 --> 01:07:45,966
Don't worry. Everyone likes it.
He's a celebrity. Come on.

1285
01:07:46,091 --> 01:07:47,301
Okay.

1286
01:07:47,801 --> 01:07:49,762
Yes, hello. It's me.

1287
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:52,431
- These are my children.
- Hi.

1288
01:07:52,514 --> 01:07:54,099
- Who's that?
- That's my brother.

1289
01:07:54,183 --> 01:07:55,267
Hi. I'm Hackus.

1290
01:07:55,768 --> 01:07:57,936
Look at that. It's a magical creature.

1291
01:07:58,312 --> 01:07:59,772
Hi.

1292
01:07:59,855 --> 01:08:01,190
It's my birthday.

1293
01:08:01,774 --> 01:08:02,816
Thank you.

1294
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:05,110
- I have a FASTPASS.
- Yeah, FASTPASS.

1295
01:08:06,153 --> 01:08:07,613
Monsieur Gargamel!

1296
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,491
Thank you for keeping our seats warm.
Goodbye.

1297
01:08:10,616 --> 01:08:11,659
Bye-bye!

1298
01:08:11,784 --> 01:08:14,828
Come along, children. Right this way.

1299
01:08:15,079 --> 01:08:17,998
Monsieur Gargamel! Monsieur Gargamel!

1300
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,918
Let's go!

1301
01:08:21,001 --> 01:08:22,252
- Father.
- Not now.

1302
01:08:22,336 --> 01:08:23,754
It's feeding time soon.

1303
01:08:23,837 --> 01:08:25,756
- Not now!
- But...

1304
01:08:27,925 --> 01:08:29,009
Here we are.

1305
01:08:30,177 --> 01:08:33,764
- Our fun is just beginning, eh?
- Yeah.

1306
01:08:34,556 --> 01:08:37,142
Alakazelevate!

1307
01:08:43,023 --> 01:08:45,567
But isn't this lovely, my dear?

1308
01:08:45,943 --> 01:08:47,820
And just think,

1309
01:08:47,903 --> 01:08:52,282
with your secret formula
and my incredible magic,

1310
01:08:52,366 --> 01:08:56,370
there's absolutely nothing
that we cannot do.

1311
01:08:57,705 --> 01:08:59,289
Yeah.

1312
01:08:59,373 --> 01:09:02,501
Think of all the fun we
could have, Smurfette.

1313
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,258
Okay.

1314
01:09:09,341 --> 01:09:12,803
Then why are we going so slow?

1315
01:09:32,489 --> 01:09:34,825
- Look out!
- Yeah!

1316
01:09:34,908 --> 01:09:36,493
Isn't this fun?

1317
01:09:36,577 --> 01:09:38,162
Decidedly not!

1318
01:09:48,547 --> 01:09:52,259
Best ride ever! Smurfette's fun, huh?

1319
01:09:58,807 --> 01:10:00,476
Incoming!

1320
01:10:00,559 --> 01:10:03,270
Look out! Coming through!

1321
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,733
Sorry!

1322
01:10:24,458 --> 01:10:26,126
I must have failed her.

1323
01:10:27,586 --> 01:10:30,798
Sorry. I was looking for a place to think.

1324
01:10:30,964 --> 01:10:33,550
No, no, no, no. It's okay.

1325
01:10:33,634 --> 01:10:36,303
I was doing a little thinking myself.

1326
01:10:39,932 --> 01:10:42,935
Master Winslow, it's hard for me,

1327
01:10:43,101 --> 01:10:46,438
but, well, can I ask you some advice?

1328
01:10:46,647 --> 01:10:48,482
I mean, papa to Papa.

1329
01:10:49,608 --> 01:10:51,318
It's about Smurfette.

1330
01:10:52,152 --> 01:10:53,821
I don't know what to do.

1331
01:10:53,987 --> 01:10:56,114
I turned her blue.

1332
01:10:56,198 --> 01:10:58,992
I taught her love and kindness.

1333
01:10:59,117 --> 01:11:01,995
But the truth is, Gargamel made her.

1334
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:06,124
She's only a Smurf
as long as she chooses to be.

1335
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:08,544
But what if she doesn't?

1336
01:11:10,212 --> 01:11:12,422
What if she chooses him?

1337
01:11:12,506 --> 01:11:14,675
We could lose her.

1338
01:11:14,758 --> 01:11:16,677
We may have already.

1339
01:11:18,595 --> 01:11:20,305
I haven't done enough.

1340
01:11:20,389 --> 01:11:21,765
Are you kidding?

1341
01:11:21,932 --> 01:11:24,309
Gargamel just made her, but you,

1342
01:11:24,393 --> 01:11:25,769
you made her what she is.

1343
01:11:25,853 --> 01:11:28,730
You stepped in and loved her
as your very own.

1344
01:11:29,022 --> 01:11:31,024
No one asked you to, you just did.

1345
01:11:31,358 --> 01:11:33,610
Because you knew she needed that.

1346
01:11:33,694 --> 01:11:35,821
And that's a...

1347
01:11:38,365 --> 01:11:41,910
That's a pretty special kind of love.

1348
01:11:44,538 --> 01:11:46,707
She's way too smart not to see that.

1349
01:11:49,376 --> 01:11:50,961
You're right.

1350
01:11:51,044 --> 01:11:53,714
We didn't believe in her
because she changed.

1351
01:11:53,797 --> 01:11:56,174
She changed because we believed in her.

1352
01:11:57,968 --> 01:11:59,636
Thank you, Master Winslow.

1353
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:03,056
That was exactly what I needed to hear.

1354
01:12:11,899 --> 01:12:13,400
Me, too.

1355
01:12:15,611 --> 01:12:17,279
Just a few more bubbles.

1356
01:12:17,529 --> 01:12:18,906
How's that?

1357
01:12:18,989 --> 01:12:22,242
Sweet Smurf in Heaven,
what have you eaten?

1358
01:12:22,409 --> 01:12:25,746
It's okay.
Every time a Smurf toots, someone smiles.

1359
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:27,998
- Let's go, Smurfs.
- Where?

1360
01:12:28,081 --> 01:12:29,249
We're getting Smurfette.

1361
01:12:29,416 --> 01:12:31,168
But you saw her, Papa.

1362
01:12:31,752 --> 01:12:33,170
She's one of them now.

1363
01:12:33,253 --> 01:12:35,005
- A horse whisperer?
- No!

1364
01:12:35,088 --> 01:12:37,049
- A French Socialist?
- No!

1365
01:12:37,132 --> 01:12:38,258
A Flying Wallenda!

1366
01:12:38,342 --> 01:12:40,135
No, she's with Gargamel. Keep up.

1367
01:12:40,344 --> 01:12:42,012
I don't care what we saw.

1368
01:12:42,095 --> 01:12:44,431
You never give up on family.

1369
01:12:44,514 --> 01:12:46,433
Yeah, Papa's right.

1370
01:12:46,516 --> 01:12:48,810
Who are you,
and what have you done with Grouchy?

1371
01:12:48,894 --> 01:12:51,021
Hey, I'm Positive, remember?

1372
01:12:51,605 --> 01:12:54,149
All right, Smurfs. Let's get smurfing.

1373
01:12:55,108 --> 01:12:57,277
Master Winslow, you coming with us?

1374
01:12:57,444 --> 01:12:58,946
Is a Smurf's butt blue?

1375
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:02,449
You tell me.

1376
01:13:02,908 --> 01:13:04,034
Grouchy.

1377
01:13:04,326 --> 01:13:07,037
- Put it away.
- Anybody else?

1378
01:13:07,663 --> 01:13:09,748
Okay, then. Out of the tub with you.

1379
01:13:09,831 --> 01:13:10,916
- We've got work to do.
- Hey.

1380
01:13:10,999 --> 01:13:13,126
Let's smurf this mushroom stand.
Let's roll.

1381
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:15,379
Yeah, guys, let's do this.

1382
01:13:24,346 --> 01:13:25,430
Victor? Hey.

1383
01:13:54,167 --> 01:13:56,044
Okay, Master Winslow, we'll split up here.

1384
01:13:56,211 --> 01:13:58,296
All right. I'll find the
electrical room and cut the power.

1385
01:13:58,505 --> 01:13:59,506
And we'll find Smurfette.

1386
01:13:59,589 --> 01:14:01,675
And we'll all look fabulous doing it.

1387
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:03,343
Oh, come on.

1388
01:14:03,427 --> 01:14:05,387
Team building. Hello!

1389
01:14:05,554 --> 01:14:08,015
All right, see you inside. Good luck.

1390
01:14:08,181 --> 01:14:10,017
- Come on, guys.
- lnto the belly of the beast.

1391
01:14:12,352 --> 01:14:14,646
Why are we coming down here, Father?

1392
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:18,692
Well, we are celebrating
your long-lost sister's birthday.

1393
01:14:18,775 --> 01:14:19,776
Really?

1394
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:22,279
Can't very well end the festivities without

1395
01:14:23,905 --> 01:14:25,198
a cake.

1396
01:14:26,324 --> 01:14:29,703
I made you your favourite, my dear.
Blue velvet.

1397
01:14:31,371 --> 01:14:32,497
Cake.

1398
01:14:33,582 --> 01:14:36,626
Go ahead. Go ahead. Make a wish, my dear.

1399
01:14:36,710 --> 01:14:41,256
Anything your tiny little heart
can dream of, and it is yours.

1400
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:43,050
Anything?

1401
01:14:43,133 --> 01:14:44,426
But of course.

1402
01:14:45,218 --> 01:14:46,887
Yes, well, within reason.

1403
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:51,224
I'm afraid we're on a bit
of an essence budget around here lately.

1404
01:14:51,308 --> 01:14:54,728
That's why we need the formula, you see.

1405
01:15:01,485 --> 01:15:03,236
There she is.

1406
01:15:03,403 --> 01:15:05,280
Is that a birthday cake?

1407
01:15:05,363 --> 01:15:07,240
We had a birthday cake for her, too.

1408
01:15:07,407 --> 01:15:09,826
She just never saw it.

1409
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:12,871
They look like a happy family.

1410
01:15:12,954 --> 01:15:15,290
She's not going to give him the formula,
is she, Papa?

1411
01:15:15,373 --> 01:15:18,960
If she does,
it would mean the end of all Smurf kind.

1412
01:15:20,587 --> 01:15:22,672
Wait. Even the handsome ones?

1413
01:15:22,798 --> 01:15:24,758
- Yeah.
- Vanity, you come with me.

1414
01:15:24,841 --> 01:15:27,094
Clumsy and Grouchy,
go meet Master Winslow.

1415
01:15:38,396 --> 01:15:40,190
Victor, what are you doing here?

1416
01:15:40,273 --> 01:15:41,399
Grace called me.

1417
01:15:41,525 --> 01:15:43,610
She said you might need a hand.

1418
01:15:46,488 --> 01:15:48,323
No, no. Victor, wait.

1419
01:15:49,908 --> 01:15:51,910
As usual, Grace is right.

1420
01:15:52,869 --> 01:15:53,912
I could use some help.

1421
01:15:54,496 --> 01:15:57,666
Well, for starters,
you might try lifting the sewer cover.

1422
01:15:57,749 --> 01:15:59,167
Unless you're planning
on fixing the phone lines?

1423
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,967
Smurfette, the formula?

1424
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:08,927
Take all the time you need, my dear.

1425
01:16:09,094 --> 01:16:10,720
As long as it's very, very soon.

1426
01:16:10,887 --> 01:16:13,723
Then we can all be blue. Together.

1427
01:16:13,849 --> 01:16:17,102
Hackus blue. Hackus blue.

1428
01:16:17,644 --> 01:16:19,229
You see? They want to be blue,

1429
01:16:19,646 --> 01:16:21,481
just like their big sister.

1430
01:16:21,982 --> 01:16:24,651
Then we could be a real family.

1431
01:16:29,072 --> 01:16:30,991
This is something.

1432
01:16:31,074 --> 01:16:35,370
A sacred gift entrusted to me.

1433
01:16:38,331 --> 01:16:39,833
I'm sorry.

1434
01:16:41,126 --> 01:16:42,711
I just, I...

1435
01:16:44,212 --> 01:16:45,505
I can't.

1436
01:16:48,341 --> 01:16:50,927
What do you mean, you can't?

1437
01:16:51,011 --> 01:16:52,345
I've given you everything.

1438
01:16:52,971 --> 01:16:54,556
Kindness, presents,

1439
01:16:54,723 --> 01:16:57,767
a cake with no poison. It's been horrible!

1440
01:16:57,851 --> 01:17:00,562
Now, I have had just about enough of this,
young lady.

1441
01:17:00,645 --> 01:17:03,440
You are going to give me
what I want right now!

1442
01:17:03,523 --> 01:17:04,858
- The formula!
- No!

1443
01:17:04,941 --> 01:17:05,942
Yes!

1444
01:17:06,026 --> 01:17:07,360
- Father?
- What, what, what?

1445
01:17:09,654 --> 01:17:12,324
Hackus dizzy.

1446
01:17:12,407 --> 01:17:13,992
What's happening to them?

1447
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:15,410
So dizzy.

1448
01:17:15,493 --> 01:17:18,955
Don't tell me you actually care
for these pathetic creatures.

1449
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:20,290
How sad for you.

1450
01:17:22,042 --> 01:17:26,213
And how absolutely perfect for me.

1451
01:17:26,713 --> 01:17:27,964
It looks like the power lines run this way.

1452
01:17:28,048 --> 01:17:29,799
Let's go! Let's go!
We got to get her out of there!

1453
01:17:29,883 --> 01:17:31,343
All right, let's do this!

1454
01:17:31,509 --> 01:17:33,637
This way, Vanity. Through this pipe.

1455
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:36,973
We have to save her!
This could be my moment!

1456
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:42,812
I'm so sorry, my dear. I thought you knew.

1457
01:17:42,896 --> 01:17:46,233
Without essence, they cannot live.

1458
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,777
- Father.
- No.

1459
01:17:48,944 --> 01:17:50,111
Please.

1460
01:17:50,195 --> 01:17:51,821
No. Vexy.

1461
01:17:55,408 --> 01:17:57,494
So dizzy.

1462
01:17:58,078 --> 01:18:00,288
- Hackus.
- Smurfette.

1463
01:18:00,914 --> 01:18:02,916
Give them what you have!
Take some from me.

1464
01:18:03,041 --> 01:18:04,042
Take some!

1465
01:18:05,085 --> 01:18:06,127
Please!

1466
01:18:06,211 --> 01:18:08,755
What's the point?
You won't give me the formula,

1467
01:18:08,838 --> 01:18:12,676
so, well, I might as well just let them go.

1468
01:18:13,051 --> 01:18:14,135
Vexy.

1469
01:18:15,553 --> 01:18:18,265
You mean you'd let them die?

1470
01:18:19,557 --> 01:18:21,268
I can always make others.

1471
01:18:21,393 --> 01:18:25,188
Besides, I am not the one letting them die.

1472
01:18:25,605 --> 01:18:26,690
You are.

1473
01:18:29,109 --> 01:18:31,069
Okay. Okay.

1474
01:18:31,444 --> 01:18:34,364
I'll give it to you. Just feed them.

1475
01:18:35,573 --> 01:18:37,450
The formula first.

1476
01:18:37,659 --> 01:18:40,287
Feed them. Feed them!

1477
01:18:40,453 --> 01:18:41,913
Quickly. We have to get in there.

1478
01:18:41,997 --> 01:18:44,124
- Dead end!
- It's locked!

1479
01:18:45,667 --> 01:18:49,129
The formu-la-la-la-la-la-la.

1480
01:18:51,631 --> 01:18:53,133
One hopeful thought.

1481
01:18:54,342 --> 01:18:56,428
A dab of royal jelly.

1482
01:18:57,846 --> 01:18:59,139
Mimosa pollen.

1483
01:18:59,222 --> 01:19:00,265
Smurfette.

1484
01:19:00,348 --> 01:19:02,600
- Smurfette!
- Yes, good girl.

1485
01:19:02,809 --> 01:19:04,728
I can hear them, but I can't see them.

1486
01:19:04,811 --> 01:19:06,938
Wait! I know.

1487
01:19:07,022 --> 01:19:08,064
Papa, look.

1488
01:19:08,231 --> 01:19:09,691
- And a drop of mink oil.
- I knew it.

1489
01:19:09,774 --> 01:19:12,068
Is she giving him the formula?

1490
01:19:12,152 --> 01:19:13,528
- Oh, no.
- Smurfette.

1491
01:19:13,611 --> 01:19:14,654
Help me get this open.

1492
01:19:15,155 --> 01:19:17,782
And you must say one loving truth.

1493
01:19:18,408 --> 01:19:20,160
- Of course.
- There.

1494
01:19:20,285 --> 01:19:22,412
That's the formula Papa used.

1495
01:19:22,495 --> 01:19:24,164
Now, feed them! Please!

1496
01:19:24,247 --> 01:19:25,332
First, we'll see if this works, huh?

1497
01:19:27,334 --> 01:19:28,543
Hurry!

1498
01:19:29,711 --> 01:19:30,754
- Come on.
- Here we are.

1499
01:19:30,837 --> 01:19:32,172
Let's go! Let's go!

1500
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,467
Pull, Patrick. Put your back into it.

1501
01:19:35,717 --> 01:19:38,136
- Come on!
- Hey, there's an opening down here.

1502
01:19:38,345 --> 01:19:40,889
- Come on, Positive.
- Yeah, let's shut 'em down.

1503
01:19:41,306 --> 01:19:43,600
One loving truth.

1504
01:19:43,683 --> 01:19:45,352
I hope this works.

1505
01:20:29,229 --> 01:20:30,522
Hackus.

1506
01:20:32,148 --> 01:20:35,735
- Smurfette. Thank you.
- Vexy!

1507
01:20:35,902 --> 01:20:39,072
Oh, my Smurf, it worked.

1508
01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:40,573
- Hackus!
- Hackus blue!

1509
01:20:40,657 --> 01:20:42,575
Hackus.

1510
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:44,411
Hackus is blue!

1511
01:20:44,536 --> 01:20:46,996
We're blue! We're Smurfs!

1512
01:20:47,122 --> 01:20:49,332
It worked. All the world is mine!

1513
01:20:49,666 --> 01:20:52,419
- I can make my own Smurfs!
- No!

1514
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,589
We've been betrayed.

1515
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:59,300
Finally, finally.

1516
01:20:59,384 --> 01:21:01,261
You're a real boy.

1517
01:21:01,428 --> 01:21:02,429
I'm blue.

1518
01:21:02,595 --> 01:21:04,431
Now into the machine with all of you.

1519
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:05,682
Father, no.

1520
01:21:06,641 --> 01:21:10,603
- No cage for Hackus. No cage for Hackus.
- All right, all right.

1521
01:21:11,229 --> 01:21:13,106
- In you go.
- No cage for Hackus!

1522
01:21:13,189 --> 01:21:15,275
- Everybody gets their own room.
- Please!

1523
01:21:15,692 --> 01:21:18,736
- I failed her, Vanity.
- Papa, wait.

1524
01:21:19,446 --> 01:21:21,322
I think I can reach that pin.

1525
01:21:21,406 --> 01:21:22,907
Good idea, Vanity.

1526
01:21:22,991 --> 01:21:24,367
Come on, come on.

1527
01:21:25,285 --> 01:21:26,661
Father, please.

1528
01:21:26,744 --> 01:21:28,246
Now, don't go anywhere.

1529
01:21:30,582 --> 01:21:33,793
You face leaking.

1530
01:21:35,128 --> 01:21:37,297
Hackus leaking.

1531
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:41,217
Hackus leaking.

1532
01:21:41,301 --> 01:21:46,097
You sacrificed everything just to save us.

1533
01:21:46,681 --> 01:21:48,141
I had to.

1534
01:21:48,725 --> 01:21:49,893
I care about you.

1535
01:21:51,978 --> 01:21:53,521
We're family.

1536
01:21:54,689 --> 01:21:56,900
No like leaking.

1537
01:21:56,983 --> 01:21:58,735
Hackus like blue.

1538
01:21:58,902 --> 01:22:01,070
What a sickening scene.

1539
01:22:01,154 --> 01:22:03,823
I'd be completely nauseated if this weren't

1540
01:22:04,032 --> 01:22:06,910
the happiest moment of my life!

1541
01:22:07,076 --> 01:22:09,078
- Try the lever, the big one.
- Get on my shoulders.

1542
01:22:09,370 --> 01:22:10,830
Hurry, lads.

1543
01:22:10,914 --> 01:22:11,956
Which way do I go?

1544
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:13,958
Try negative. That might shut it off.

1545
01:22:14,042 --> 01:22:16,878
Negative? Nah. I'm all about positive.

1546
01:22:20,173 --> 01:22:21,216
There.

1547
01:22:21,299 --> 01:22:25,261
One small step for a wizard,

1548
01:22:25,345 --> 01:22:28,348
one giant leap for... What?

1549
01:22:29,599 --> 01:22:30,683
Positive!

1550
01:22:31,184 --> 01:22:33,311
Too much smurf berry cobbler.

1551
01:22:33,603 --> 01:22:34,604
Grouchy!

1552
01:22:34,854 --> 01:22:37,774
Yes, I said you could press the button,
didn't I?

1553
01:22:40,235 --> 01:22:42,111
Grouchy!

1554
01:22:42,278 --> 01:22:44,364
I lied. One giant leap for me!

1555
01:22:49,285 --> 01:22:50,745
Just got fried.

1556
01:22:50,828 --> 01:22:53,206
Hard to put a positive spin on that.

1557
01:22:58,378 --> 01:22:59,546
Son of a Smurf!

1558
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,713
Hurry, Vanity.

1559
01:23:00,797 --> 01:23:04,050
Narcissism is about to save the day.

1560
01:23:04,551 --> 01:23:05,677
- Got it!
- Smurftastic work.

1561
01:23:05,802 --> 01:23:07,011
- I knew it.
- Now go.

1562
01:23:07,095 --> 01:23:08,555
- What?
- Go!

1563
01:23:08,721 --> 01:23:09,931
Come, Azrael!

1564
01:23:10,014 --> 01:23:14,310
Apparently, we must harness
the power of the skies one final time.

1565
01:23:14,394 --> 01:23:15,812
Why does this have to be so Les Misérables?

1566
01:23:15,895 --> 01:23:18,439
- Let's go.
- Look at me, all rough-and-tumble.

1567
01:23:18,523 --> 01:23:20,483
I'm like Commando Smurf.

1568
01:23:20,567 --> 01:23:21,776
Hooah!

1569
01:23:22,819 --> 01:23:25,363
You are right.
Commandos are quiet and stealthy.

1570
01:23:25,572 --> 01:23:26,948
Hooah!

1571
01:23:27,031 --> 01:23:28,491
- There she is!
- Smurfette.

1572
01:23:29,576 --> 01:23:30,827
Santa!

1573
01:23:31,286 --> 01:23:34,289
Papa? You... You came for me.

1574
01:23:34,455 --> 01:23:37,709
Well, of course we came for you.
You're my daughter.

1575
01:23:37,875 --> 01:23:39,586
Was there ever a question?

1576
01:23:39,794 --> 01:23:41,379
- No, it's locked.
- Go on through.

1577
01:23:41,588 --> 01:23:42,672
- We'll find another way.
- Okay.

1578
01:23:42,755 --> 01:23:45,216
We'll see you in there, Master Winslow.
Hurry!

1579
01:23:48,636 --> 01:23:49,887
Here.

1580
01:23:50,555 --> 01:23:51,848
Hold this!

1581
01:24:08,656 --> 01:24:09,866
Papa.

1582
01:24:09,949 --> 01:24:12,118
Oh, my dear.

1583
01:24:12,785 --> 01:24:16,456
Papa, I gave Gargamel the formula.

1584
01:24:16,664 --> 01:24:18,207
But she saved our lives.

1585
01:24:18,374 --> 01:24:20,835
Hackus live! Hackus live!

1586
01:24:20,918 --> 01:24:23,796
Papa, I let you down.

1587
01:24:24,631 --> 01:24:27,050
I betrayed the Smurfs.

1588
01:24:27,133 --> 01:24:28,635
I'm so sorry.

1589
01:24:28,843 --> 01:24:33,723
Smurfette, life is the most precious thing
to protect.

1590
01:24:33,806 --> 01:24:35,892
I'm very proud of you.

1591
01:24:35,975 --> 01:24:37,935
You... You are?

1592
01:24:38,144 --> 01:24:41,022
Seriously? No spanking?
No smack to the knuckles?

1593
01:24:41,105 --> 01:24:43,149
You forgive her, just like that?

1594
01:24:43,399 --> 01:24:46,736
Of course.
We rise to the amount of love we're shown,

1595
01:24:46,819 --> 01:24:50,114
and we sink only when that love stops.

1596
01:24:50,198 --> 01:24:53,868
Hackus leaking again. Leaking again!

1597
01:24:54,285 --> 01:24:55,662
Hey, you found Smurfette!

1598
01:24:56,329 --> 01:24:57,538
Hello.

1599
01:24:58,581 --> 01:24:59,624
Hi.

1600
01:25:01,542 --> 01:25:02,752
Oh, no, we don't have much time.

1601
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,214
Let's just get the formula back
and get out of here. Hooah!

1602
01:25:06,339 --> 01:25:07,924
Wait! What about them?

1603
01:25:08,091 --> 01:25:10,051
What about them? They kidnapped you.

1604
01:25:10,134 --> 01:25:11,427
Yeah, they're Gargamel's.

1605
01:25:11,511 --> 01:25:16,057
So was I, but Papa never gave up on me.

1606
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:18,518
So I'm not about to give up on them.

1607
01:25:19,143 --> 01:25:21,479
And you thought you weren't a real Smurf.

1608
01:25:22,772 --> 01:25:24,357
- Get them out, quickly.
- Right, Papa.

1609
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,025
Free Hackus!

1610
01:25:26,192 --> 01:25:28,611
And then there were seven, eh?

1611
01:25:29,821 --> 01:25:31,155
Hello, kitty.

1612
01:25:31,364 --> 01:25:33,866
Welcome to the party, Papa!

1613
01:25:35,368 --> 01:25:37,829
Look at all this essence.

1614
01:25:40,498 --> 01:25:43,626
I love your work. Really, all of you.

1615
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:46,546
In particular, your Blue Period.

1616
01:25:47,213 --> 01:25:50,049
My whole body is scrunching!

1617
01:25:50,258 --> 01:25:52,468
That's enough, Gargamel.

1618
01:25:52,552 --> 01:25:53,970
You have enough.

1619
01:25:54,053 --> 01:25:58,808
Yes, yes, but you see, Papa,
I want more than enough!

1620
01:26:01,477 --> 01:26:05,064
After all, I have to be able to power this!

1621
01:26:06,899 --> 01:26:10,153
I call her La Wanda.

1622
01:26:11,863 --> 01:26:13,531
You get it? Because it's a wand.

1623
01:26:13,614 --> 01:26:15,408
So I called it La... It's very funny.

1624
01:26:15,491 --> 01:26:19,328
If you weren't in excruciating pain,
you'd be laughing hysterically, believe me.

1625
01:26:23,708 --> 01:26:27,462
Whatever will I do with all of this power?

1626
01:26:29,422 --> 01:26:30,590
That's right.

1627
01:26:30,673 --> 01:26:34,010
I'm going to rule the entire world!

1628
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:35,595
No.

1629
01:26:36,304 --> 01:26:37,513
And, Papa,

1630
01:26:37,597 --> 01:26:40,475
I want you to know
that as my first official act,

1631
01:26:40,558 --> 01:26:47,315
I'm going to create a portal all the way from
Smurf Village right here to my Smurfalator,

1632
01:26:47,398 --> 01:26:51,736
so you get to be
with all of your little smurfy friends.

1633
01:26:53,654 --> 01:26:55,364
Forever!

1634
01:26:55,448 --> 01:26:56,574
I don't think so, Gargamel.

1635
01:27:00,745 --> 01:27:01,829
Hit it again.

1636
01:27:02,038 --> 01:27:03,122
- Give it to me.
- Hurry.

1637
01:27:04,373 --> 01:27:06,209
Hurry, he's going for his wand.

1638
01:27:07,126 --> 01:27:09,921
- Just break it already!
- I'm too beautiful to die!

1639
01:27:10,922 --> 01:27:13,841
For the love of Smurf, use the pointy end!

1640
01:27:13,925 --> 01:27:16,093
Don't just stand there yelling at me!
Attack!

1641
01:27:17,303 --> 01:27:18,346
Yes!

1642
01:27:21,849 --> 01:27:23,059
Oh, no.

1643
01:27:25,019 --> 01:27:26,312
Alaka...

1644
01:28:14,026 --> 01:28:15,778
Hackus real boy.

1645
01:28:16,362 --> 01:28:18,364
Thrown to the curb again.

1646
01:28:18,447 --> 01:28:20,199
Careful, Clumsy!

1647
01:28:20,283 --> 01:28:21,993
- Every time!
- Sorry.

1648
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:23,202
Really?

1649
01:28:23,286 --> 01:28:24,453
High fours!

1650
01:28:35,298 --> 01:28:36,507
Is everyone all right?

1651
01:28:36,716 --> 01:28:38,759
All smurfy and accounted for.

1652
01:28:39,010 --> 01:28:41,095
- Patrick!
- Daddy!

1653
01:28:41,178 --> 01:28:42,763
- Hey.
- Hey, Grace!

1654
01:28:42,847 --> 01:28:44,223
Hey.

1655
01:28:45,308 --> 01:28:46,475
We did it!

1656
01:28:46,559 --> 01:28:48,102
Grace!

1657
01:28:48,185 --> 01:28:49,270
Smurfette.

1658
01:28:49,437 --> 01:28:50,563
I've missed you.

1659
01:28:51,314 --> 01:28:53,065
I was so worried about you.

1660
01:28:53,232 --> 01:28:56,319
Grace, this is Vexy, my other sister.

1661
01:28:57,528 --> 01:28:59,780
Well, I guess that makes
you my sister, too.

1662
01:29:01,616 --> 01:29:03,075
Are you okay?

1663
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:07,872
Is this what happy feels like?

1664
01:29:08,748 --> 01:29:11,000
Hello, pretty lady! I'm pretty, too!

1665
01:29:11,083 --> 01:29:13,628
And this is Hackus, my brother.

1666
01:29:13,711 --> 01:29:14,754
Hackus!

1667
01:29:14,879 --> 01:29:16,756
Hackus, this is Grace and Patrick.

1668
01:29:17,131 --> 01:29:19,467
- Hello!
- And... Your baby?

1669
01:29:19,634 --> 01:29:20,927
This is Blue.

1670
01:29:21,427 --> 01:29:22,970
You did good, Grace.

1671
01:29:23,054 --> 01:29:24,847
He's blue-tiful.

1672
01:29:25,431 --> 01:29:26,974
Who this? Who this?

1673
01:29:27,058 --> 01:29:28,559
That's Victor.

1674
01:29:28,726 --> 01:29:29,769
He's...

1675
01:29:29,894 --> 01:29:30,895
He's my dad.

1676
01:29:32,271 --> 01:29:34,732
And Blue's pretty fantastic grandpa.

1677
01:29:40,655 --> 01:29:42,281
Daddy and Vicster!

1678
01:29:44,283 --> 01:29:46,494
Okay. I got it.

1679
01:29:46,744 --> 01:29:48,287
I'm really proud of you, Patrick Winslow.

1680
01:29:48,454 --> 01:29:50,706
Hyphen-Doyle.

1681
01:29:51,457 --> 01:29:52,875
Hyphen-Smurf.

1682
01:29:53,668 --> 01:29:56,128
Yeah, guys! Smurf pound.

1683
01:29:56,212 --> 01:29:58,756
- Vanity?
- Great job! Great job!

1684
01:29:58,839 --> 01:30:00,549
- Positive?
- Hey, get that thing out of here!

1685
01:30:00,633 --> 01:30:01,926
I'm not pounding anything!

1686
01:30:02,009 --> 01:30:05,346
I'm Grouchy,
and I got a lot of pent-up anger to vent!

1687
01:30:05,721 --> 01:30:07,598
Wow, that feels good.

1688
01:30:07,682 --> 01:30:08,849
I'm back!

1689
01:30:09,266 --> 01:30:10,935
And so am I!

1690
01:30:11,477 --> 01:30:12,561
Perfect.

1691
01:30:12,728 --> 01:30:14,355
I think most of you know La Wanda...

1692
01:30:14,438 --> 01:30:17,733
Unfortunately.
- ...which is a hilarious play on words.

1693
01:30:18,734 --> 01:30:22,571
- Smurfette.
- Say hello to my enormous friend!

1694
01:30:22,863 --> 01:30:25,282
I don't think so, Gargamel!

1695
01:30:29,704 --> 01:30:30,830
Yeah!

1696
01:30:32,123 --> 01:30:34,625
Wanda! No, La Wanda, no!

1697
01:30:34,709 --> 01:30:37,503
Where is the "off" button on this thing?

1698
01:30:45,761 --> 01:30:46,846
No, no, no, no.

1699
01:30:47,596 --> 01:30:48,723
No...

1700
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:56,147
No, La Wanda! No means no!

1701
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:15,499
This is really, really gonna hurt.

1702
01:31:22,048 --> 01:31:24,800
- Bravo, Smurfette! Bravo!
- Good job, Smurfette!

1703
01:31:24,884 --> 01:31:26,302
That was amazing!

1704
01:31:26,385 --> 01:31:28,220
Well, that takes care of Gargamel.

1705
01:31:28,637 --> 01:31:30,139
Let's go home, everybody!

1706
01:31:30,222 --> 01:31:31,348
- Yeah!
- Home!

1707
01:31:31,432 --> 01:31:33,976
We still have one small problem.

1708
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:35,811
I've only got five crystals.

1709
01:31:35,978 --> 01:31:39,565
Well, I say no Smurf left behind.

1710
01:31:40,399 --> 01:31:42,693
Wow, Smurfette.

1711
01:31:42,777 --> 01:31:45,237
You are pretty good with that wand.

1712
01:31:45,988 --> 01:31:47,656
It's kind of in my blood.

1713
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:49,742
Which used to concern me.

1714
01:31:50,409 --> 01:31:52,745
But as someone wonderful once told me,

1715
01:31:52,828 --> 01:31:55,164
it doesn't matter where you came from.

1716
01:31:55,247 --> 01:31:59,085
What matters is who you choose to be.

1717
01:31:59,168 --> 01:32:01,170
That's my girl.

1718
01:32:01,253 --> 01:32:03,422
And you're our papa.

1719
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:06,509
Thanks for giving us a new home.

1720
01:32:06,592 --> 01:32:08,928
And a new family.

1721
01:32:09,011 --> 01:32:10,554
You're a good Smurf, Papa.

1722
01:32:10,638 --> 01:32:12,932
You'll be a good one, too.

1723
01:32:13,182 --> 01:32:14,600
I'm gonna miss you, Smurfs.

1724
01:32:14,683 --> 01:32:16,227
Maybe you can name a corn dog after them.

1725
01:32:16,477 --> 01:32:18,979
Now you're talking. We could use blue corn.

1726
01:32:19,188 --> 01:32:20,648
Smurf dogs, yum!

1727
01:32:21,273 --> 01:32:22,441
Yes!

1728
01:32:22,525 --> 01:32:23,859
Well, safe travels, guys.

1729
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,362
And smurf back soon.

1730
01:32:26,445 --> 01:32:28,489
Thank you once again, Master Winslow.

1731
01:32:31,408 --> 01:32:32,701
Miss Doolittle.

1732
01:32:33,953 --> 01:32:35,204
Little Blue.

1733
01:32:35,621 --> 01:32:36,956
Papa Vicster.

1734
01:32:38,582 --> 01:32:40,417
- Goodbye, Winslow family.
- Goodbye, Papa.

1735
01:32:40,501 --> 01:32:42,169
- Bye-bye!
- Toodles!

1736
01:32:42,253 --> 01:32:45,047
- Well, let's go, Smurfs.
- Bye-bye, Winslows.

1737
01:32:45,131 --> 01:32:48,676
I can't wait to see the rest of my family.

1738
01:32:51,637 --> 01:32:53,639
Bye, Smurfs!

1739
01:33:04,316 --> 01:33:05,943
- Hey, personal space.
- Sorry.

1740
01:33:06,068 --> 01:33:07,403
Papa, you got Smurfette!

1741
01:33:07,778 --> 01:33:09,029
Welcome home, Smurfette!

1742
01:33:09,196 --> 01:33:11,657
- Well, looky here!
- Yeah, we're back!

1743
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:13,576
- Hi, guys!
- This is good.

1744
01:33:13,659 --> 01:33:15,828
And some new Smurfs for our family.

1745
01:33:15,911 --> 01:33:17,872
Everyone, this is Vexy.

1746
01:33:17,955 --> 01:33:20,708
- Great goobaloo!
- She's a sassy lassie.

1747
01:33:20,791 --> 01:33:21,834
Hi.

1748
01:33:22,001 --> 01:33:23,586
- Hi...
- Hi, I'm Greedy.

1749
01:33:23,669 --> 01:33:26,755
Hi, I'm Greedy. You want
to share a cupcake?

1750
01:33:30,092 --> 01:33:31,594
- Crikey!
- What the hey?

1751
01:33:31,677 --> 01:33:32,887
I nearly smurfed myself.

1752
01:33:33,179 --> 01:33:34,346
Hackus.

1753
01:33:34,430 --> 01:33:36,515
Hackus, these are your new brothers.

1754
01:33:37,016 --> 01:33:38,684
I have new brothers!

1755
01:33:39,018 --> 01:33:40,561
Squeeze!

1756
01:33:40,644 --> 01:33:41,937
Hold on a minute.

1757
01:33:42,021 --> 01:33:43,272
Technically speaking,

1758
01:33:43,355 --> 01:33:46,108
according to section six of the
Smurf Code of Genealogical Legitimacy...

1759
01:33:46,192 --> 01:33:47,735
Hey. Just give him a punt.

1760
01:33:47,818 --> 01:33:49,695
- This creature cannot...
- Hackus punt!

1761
01:33:50,321 --> 01:33:51,906
- Yeah!
- That kid's got style.

1762
01:33:51,989 --> 01:33:53,032
He's one of us.

1763
01:33:54,283 --> 01:33:58,037
And so, after waiting patiently
to be relevant again,

1764
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:02,374
our heroic Narrator
steps back into his leading role

1765
01:34:02,499 --> 01:34:04,251
to point out that when last we met,

1766
01:34:04,335 --> 01:34:07,379
the entire village was busying itself
with preparations for...

1767
01:34:07,463 --> 01:34:09,298
Hey, what's with all the decorations?

1768
01:34:09,381 --> 01:34:12,843
Happy birthday, Smurfette!

1769
01:34:12,927 --> 01:34:15,888
Do you mind? I'm trying to bookend this.

1770
01:34:15,971 --> 01:34:18,140
- And so...
- Yo, let's kick it.

1771
01:34:18,224 --> 01:34:22,811
...as the music unceremoniously
drowns out the narration...

1772
01:34:23,354 --> 01:34:24,939
This is for my new family.

1773
01:34:50,589 --> 01:34:51,632
Yeah!

1774
01:35:08,524 --> 01:35:10,651
Hey, Hackus, I got you a present.

1775
01:35:10,734 --> 01:35:12,111
Yummy!

1776
01:35:22,579 --> 01:35:24,081
Yeah!

1777
01:35:27,167 --> 01:35:28,377
Hooah!

1778
01:35:47,771 --> 01:35:49,148
Have a nice trip!

1779
01:35:58,949 --> 01:36:00,826
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! Stop, stop!

1780
01:36:02,494 --> 01:36:05,372
Help me, Wanda! Help, help me, Wanda!

1781
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,879
And where do you think you're going?
You are coming with me!

1782
01:44:20,158 --> 01:44:23,203
How dare you call me that?
I have bungled nothing!

1783
01:44:24,663 --> 01:44:26,706
Well, Paris is over, my friend.

1784
01:44:26,790 --> 01:44:29,292
We're back here in the Dark Ages.
I suggest you get used to it.

1785
01:44:31,378 --> 01:44:34,339
You want room service?
Why don't you yell out the window?

1786
01:44:36,174 --> 01:44:40,428
Don't you show your claws to me unless you
are prepared to use them, Mr Pussy Foot!

1787
01:44:40,595 --> 01:44:43,848
Pussy foot! Pussy foot! Pussy foot!

1788
01:44:44,057 --> 01:44:46,351
Stop it! Not the face! Not the face!

1788
01:44:47,305 --> 01:44:53,377
