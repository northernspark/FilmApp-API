<i>Question number two.</i>

3
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,278
<i>Describe a challenge,
hardship or a misfortune...</i>

4
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,445
<i>you have experienced in your life.</i>

5
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:47,218
<i>What have you learned from this,
and how has it prepared you for the future?</i>

6
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,070
<i>Dear Dean of Admissions,
my name is Sutter Keely...</i>

7
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:07,669
<i>and up until yesterday I had
the best fucking girlfriend in the world.</i>

8
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:12,773
<i>I know I probably shouldn't say “fuck”
right there, but I'm sorry. I have to.</i>

9
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:15,250
<i>Like, we had this connection.
Seriously.</i>

10
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:18,151
<i>Everybody knew us.
Everybody loved us.</i>

11
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,918
<i>We were a force to be reckoned with.</i>

12
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,655
<i>I'm not gonna say that we were
the life of every party, but we were.</i>

13
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,890
<i>We were the life of every party.</i>

14
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,265
<i>Before Cassidy,
I wasn't much of a relationship guy.</i>

15
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:33,337
<i>But once we started hooking up,
that all changed.</i>

16
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,599
I'm fucking horny.

17
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,342
<i>I liked her.</i>

18
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,069
<i>A lot.</i>

19
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,881
<i>Everything was going great in my world.
I don't know what happened.</i>

20
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,611
<i>I was just trying to get
my best friend Ricky...</i>

21
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,186
<i>some much-needed sexual attention.</i>

22
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,778
Colleen Marshall. She's nice.

23
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,950
She's Way too tall.
I'd look like her son.

24
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:59,827
Man, I'm tired of your excuses.
Tonight's the night.

25
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,626
What night is this?

26
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,463
Tonight's the night
I'm gonna get you some action, Ricky.

27
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:07,401
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

28
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,168
Get some sweet, sweet action.

29
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,009
I don't know about this, Sutter.

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,410
Why? They're just girls, man.

31
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,141
Relax. It's fine.

32
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,285
What is that?

33
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,978
It looks like potential.

34
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,050
Just the man we were looking for.

35
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,126
What's up, Tara, Bethany?
Hey, girls.

36
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:31,286
- Know where we can score some beers'?
- Yeah.

37
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,796
- I think I can help you outwith that.
- Okay. Lets do it!

38
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,457
Let's do it!

39
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,193
Potential, man. It's potential.

40
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,736
- My hero!
- That's What I do.

41
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,535
Bethany, you know my friend Ricky,
don't you?

42
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,712
Shit, dude.
I forgot my cell phone in the car.

43
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,282
You guys go ahead.
We'll get the next one.

44
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,084
- Bye.
- Bye.

45
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,246
- That was bullshit about the phone?
- Totally.

46
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,957
I can't Wait to get out of this place.

47
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,660
Can we put on something else, maybe?

48
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:08,823
You don't like this?
I love this. It relaxes me.

49
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,803
Gotta listen to the lyrics too.
Who's this?

50
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:16,101
<i>It was harmless.
I was just there helping out a friend.</i>

51
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,073
<i>- Is there something wrong with that?</i>
- Hey.

52
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,044
<i>But next thing I know, I'm being accused
of crossing a line or something.</i>

53
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,876
<i>- It was a complete misunderstanding.</i>
- Who is this chick?

54
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,950
<i>I still can't make sense of it.</i>

55
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,452
- This is for Ricky. I put him in a canoe-
- You are a lost cause, Sutter!

56
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,580
- Cassidy, you can't be serious now.
- We are done! We're done!

57
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,784
<i>To be honest, though,
I wasn't that worried.</i>

58
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:39,190
<i>We'd had our ups and downs, sure.
But what great couple doesn't?</i>

59
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,427
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,805
<i>Al! I had to do was calm her down,
explain the situation...</i>

61
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:54,003
<i>tell her how important she was to me,
how good we were together...</i>

62
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,205
<i>and how much our relationship meant.</i>

63
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,304
Sutter, What are you doing here?

64
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,918
Cassidy, that is a really pretty dress
that you're wearing right now.

65
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,683
That's goddamn stunning, that dress.

66
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,190
- That dress-Wow.
- Thank you.

67
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,852
- Is he drunk or something?
- Probably.

68
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,227
Let's say if “drunk” equals “A”
and something else equals

69
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,300
the answer is definitely not

70
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,630
- Sutter-
- Look, man, I know this is awkward.

71
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,296
- Maybe we should-
- No, it's really not awkward at all.

72
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,806
Marcus West talking to me.
What an honor, man.

73
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,103
- Hey, man-
- What an honor!

74
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,339
I completely understand the meaning
of the phrase “kicked to the curb”...

75
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,473
so I will bid you both
a pleasant evening.

76
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,984
- Sutter, What happened here-
- Just let him go.

77
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,644
He drives better this Way.

78
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,663
Thank you for that
vote of confidence, beautiful.

79
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,659
You are a very understanding Woman
in everything but love.

80
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,662
Fuck you.

81
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,460
<i>You want hardship, misfortune?
There you go.</i>

82
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:55,665
<i>Will I wallow in my misery? No, I won't,
Dean of Admissions. Not Sutter Keely.</i>

83
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,675
<i>In the meantime, why should
she be the only one having fun?</i>

84
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,268
<i>It's a beautiful night outside,
and I am just getting started.</i>

85
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,278
- I need to see your ID.
- What's up?

86
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:07,215
- Need to see your ID, bro.
- Dude, I had it, and then I forgot it-

87
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,412
I think I left it in there,
maybe in the bathroom.

88
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,922
- I'm sorry, brother.
- Hey, I know the manager.

89
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,650
- No ID, you can't get in.
- John?

90
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:17,318
The little one?
The manager? Big John.

91
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,634
What's up, ladies?

92
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:27,694
So, I'm 18 and I just got dumped
by my girlfriend and I need a drink.

93
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,070
So, would somebody-
like, anybody...

94
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,904
please have a drink with me?

95
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,245
Red shit!

96
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,753
What do you mean-Wait.

97
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:50,225
I thought we were all
hanging out after this.

98
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:54,662
Come on! Please! Please!
I'm not gonna beg you.

99
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,893
I will beg you. God!

100
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:00,961
Bye.

101
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,732
Hey! You're beautiful!

102
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,743
You're holy!
Down with the king!

103
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,336
Down with the motherfucking king!

104
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,985
Hello?

105
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,201
Hello?

106
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,838
Hello? Hi.

107
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,600
Hi.

108
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,768
Hi. Oh, my God.
You're alive.

109
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,346
I thought for a second
that maybe you were dead.

110
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,585
I don't think I'm dead.

111
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,354
Where the hell am I?

112
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,652
You're in the middle of a yard.

113
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,092
- Do you know who lives here?
- No.

114
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,231
Jesus, I must've fallen asleep.

115
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,234
Here. Let me help you up.

116
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,767
Where the hell's my car?

117
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,341
I don't know.

118
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,707
Do you live around here, Sutter?

119
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,579
- How do you know my name?
- We go to the same school.

120
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,276
You wouldn't know who I am.

121
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,321
No, I know you. You're-

122
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,457
I'm Aimee. Aimee Finecky.

123
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,630
That's What I was gonna say.
Nice to meet you, Aimee.

124
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,891
- Nice to meet you.
- What time is it, Aimee?

125
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,160
Ifs, like, 6:00 am.

126
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,731
Are you just getting back from a party
or something?

127
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,742
No, I'm just on my paper route.

128
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,369
It's not really mine.
It's my moms

129
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,382
But she was out with my stepdad
last night at a casino, so-

130
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,952
- They didn't get back till late.
- Do you need help?

131
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,477
- With my route?
- Yeah.

132
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,319
- No, I'm okay. Thank you though.
- I can help you.

133
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,623
I'm good. Thank you.

134
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:06,788
Aimee, you're gonna drive
around the neighborhood...

135
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,492
and I don't know Where my car is.

136
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,570
So I think that we can
help each other out.

137
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,863
What do you say?

138
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,807
- Try aiming ahead of the driveway.
- Okay.

139
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,214
Didn't realize newspaper throwing
was such a big business.

140
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:30,185
- Must make a lot of money.
- Yeah. I mean, my mom does.

141
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,483
- You get nothing?
- No, I get a little.

142
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,115
Most of it goes toward
paying the bills though, so-

143
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,524
That doesn't sound fair.
You do all the work, don't you?

144
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,689
- Some of it-Most of it.
- She's your mom.

145
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:42,766
She should be paying all your bills.

146
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,960
I'm serious.
That doesn't sound fair to me.

147
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,698
I think you're getting the raw end
of this newspaper-throwing deal.

148
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,399
- It's fine.
- I think I'm getting the hang of it.

149
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,476
Should have seen me back in the day.

150
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,511
When I was in Little League,
I had a good arm.

151
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,738
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

152
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:59,442
My dad said I could have Went pro
if I'd stuck with it.

153
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,480
Yeah! Dude, you're a natural.
Good job.

154
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,989
Shit. I think I hit a dog.

155
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,723
- What?
- I'm serious.

156
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,265
- Sutter!
- It's still Walking.

157
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,103
Went Way downtown!

158
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,408
You know, Aimee Finecky...

159
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,410
I was having a really rotten night
last night until you came along.

160
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,912
I think that we should
get lunch sometime.

161
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,609
- How about Monday?
- Okay. Monday it is.

162
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,954
- You're up early.
- Yup.

163
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,125
They have me
on a double shift. Again.

164
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,936
Damn it, Sutter.

165
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,433
Didn't I ask you to hang this for me?

166
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,600
Look how wrinkled this is.

167
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,314
Would've taken you two seconds to hang
this up for me. Is that too much to ask?

168
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,315
I forgot. I'm sorry.

169
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,408
It's not like you do much around here.

170
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,545
Hey. I do a lot around here.

171
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:16,115
I'm sorry. I hate to interrupt
your Cheerio... eating.

172
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,717
I'm sorry, Mom.

173
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,493
Sometimes you remind me
so much of your dad.

174
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,307
All right, there's leftovers
in the fridge.

175
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:35,106
I won't be home for dinner.
Or you can call your sister.

176
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,282
And, Sutter?

177
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,421
Next time I ask you to do something-

178
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,116
I love you so much it hurts.

179
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,321
- It hurts me how much I love you.
- You know what's gonna really hurt'?

180
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,331
Who knew dinner and a movie
would cost 30 bucks?

181
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,662
Pretty much anybody
who's ever been on a date.

182
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:02,672
The best part is, dude, she didn't care.
She paid for popcorn and everything.

183
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,298
She's just-

184
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,301
What?

185
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,306
- Did you kiss her?
- Check.

186
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,509
- Yeah? Did you get tongue action?
- Double-check.

187
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,314
- Nice.
- Thanks, man.

188
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,383
What do you Want to eat for lunch?
I'm starving.

189
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,788
Aren't you eating with what's-her-name'?

190
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,827
Shit. Yeah. I forgot.

191
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,893
I gotta tell you, Sutter.
Aimee Finecky?

192
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,365
It's just a strange choice
for a rebound.

193
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,663
Dude, she's not a rebound.

194
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:36,638
Shes not. Do I look like I have
any interest in dating Aimee Finecky?

195
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,404
I think she's a nice girl...

196
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,478
whose mom makes her
deliver newspapers...

197
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,275
5:00 in the morning,
six days a week, pays half the bills.

198
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,849
Aimee doesn't say shit about it.

199
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:48,919
- That sucks.
- It's bullshit is What it is.

200
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,352
So Where do you come in?

201
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,391
I mean, I think I can help her out.

202
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,053
So, if two planes intersect,
they intersect in exactly-

203
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:02,394
Give it to me-one plane.
one point. One line.

204
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:07,504
That's lunch, you lucky sons of guns.
Don't forget to do the homework.

205
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,129
Sutter. A word, please.

206
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,834
Mr. Keely, sit down.
I have to have a word.

207
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,343
- I have somewhere to go.
- Good-bye. Good-bye, Hannah.

208
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,175
Don't be late tomorrow, please.
Thank you. You, button up.

209
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:19,945
- What's up?
- What's up?

210
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,451
I noticed you didn't
turn in your homework.

211
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,522
That's funny, man,
'cause, honestly, I did it last night.

212
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,522
I filled it Out-

213
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,025
- Do me a favor. Stop talking.
- All right.

214
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,096
- What's up?
- You tell me.

215
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,528
I only Want to see you succeed.
You know that. Right?

216
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,533
- I know.
- If you fail, that means I fail.

217
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:40,536
I like my job. I like you.
I don't Want to fail.

218
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,630
I don't Want you to fail either.
I'm not gonna let us fail.

219
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,800
I'm gonna get it together.
I'm turning that corner.

220
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,344
Make me believe you.
I Want to believe you.

221
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,438
- I'm feeling smarter already.
- Let me see you answer this.

222
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:55,918
If one acute angle
is two times larger than the other...

223
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,249
what's the measure of the two angles?

224
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,592
- That's What I thought.
- That wasn't on the homework!

225
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,660
That was the homework!
Stay there!

226
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:06,958
We're gonna do homework together.
I love it.

227
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,083
That's crazy.
How fast were you going?

228
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,554
Like 20, 25 miles an hour or something.

229
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,750
- And you just jumped out of the car?
- Yeah.

230
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,326
What?

231
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,895
It was snowing,
so I didn't think it would hurt.

232
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,554
But it did.

233
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,429
That's amazing.
That's awesome.

234
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,365
You're such a good listener.

235
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,205
All right. You go.

236
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:54,501
I remember-
I think it was sophomore year.

237
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,171
You came to gym class
wearing the mascot head.

238
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,943
You refused to take it off.

239
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,609
Yeah, that was funny.

240
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,186
It was really funny.

241
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,520
Yeah. I mean,
what's a story about you'?

242
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,649
- About me?
- Yeah.

243
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,428
I don't really have any stories.

244
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,362
Everyone's got a story.

245
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,730
Not me, I guess.

246
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,569
All right. So, I don't know.
What's your thing?

247
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,100
- My thing?
- Yeah. You know.

248
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,973
Everybody's got a thing.

249
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,104
Larry Rourke? Stoner.

250
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,375
Greg Jacoby is the rich kid.

251
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,150
What's your thing?

252
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:39,314
I'd like to think that there's more
to a person than just one thing.

253
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,186
You know?

254
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,054
- Yeah.
- Hello, Aimee.

255
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,356
So, he finally got here, did he?

256
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,058
- This is Kristal.
- Hey, Kristal. Sutter Keely.

257
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,430
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, I know who you are.

258
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,596
Aimee, come on. French Club.
They're Waiting for us. Chop-chop.

259
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:59,403
I'm so sorry. Oh, my God,
I totally forgot about French Club.

260
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,910
- I'm sorry.
- No, ifs all good.

261
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,642
Hey, did you have Mr. Aster
for geometry class?

262
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,479
Yeah, freshman year.

263
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,553
Probably thought it was pretty easy.

264
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,320
Kind of. I don't know.

265
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,049
Yeah? I'll bet you did.

266
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,820
Would you mind tutoring me?

267
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,193
He's talking all the time.
I have no idea What he's saying.

268
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,027
Yeah, sure. Totally.

269
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,424
Yeah. Just-

270
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,664
You can just call me and-Yeah.

271
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,499
Just call me.

272
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,912
Awesome.

273
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,948
It was nice meeting you too.
It was a pleasure.

274
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,643
See you later.

275
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,276
All right. Bye.

276
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,855
- You have great taste in bow ties.
- Thank you.

277
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,588
That was my favorite.
I would have bought it if you didn't.

278
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,271
See you at home.

279
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,773
Bye-bye.

280
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,717
- What do you think of that?
- You're getting better.

281
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,309
That's really good.
That's the best I've seen yet.

282
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,582
- When are you gonna adopt me?
- I'm sorry.

283
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:23,649
- Two's my limit on mouths to feed.
- Okay. Offer's still there.

284
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,127
- What were we talking about?
- Cassidy.

285
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:30,324
- Yeah.
- I liked her.

286
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,197
Yeah. Me too.

287
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,670
Kinda thought shed be the one
to yank you out of neutral.

288
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:39,231
Neutral? What are you talking about?
Dan, I'm in overdrive.

289
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,810
What?

290
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,487
- Aimee!
- Shane, shut up!

291
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,859
- How are you?
- I'm good.

292
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,767
Good. Come on in.

293
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,378
- This is my brother Shane.
- Hey, Shane.

294
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,517
- He just learned that.
- Charming.

295
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,951
- Yeah. We can study in my room.
- Lead the Way.

296
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,863
Wow.

297
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,228
This is-This is really nice.

298
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,891
Thank you.

299
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,062
I try to keep it clean.
There's a lot of stuff everywhere.

300
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,800
- You read a lot? You like books?
- I do, actually.

301
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,775
I love books.
They're mostly just science fiction.

302
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,674
A few mysteries.

303
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,804
And other things.

304
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,144
- That one is really Weird.
- This is the weird one?

305
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,479
- You picked a really weird one.
- Weird is good.

306
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,645
I say embrace the Weird.

307
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,222
It's really Weird.

308
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,526
- Is this backwards?
- Yeah. It's the way that you read them.

309
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:07,188
See, you start... back here...

310
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,323
at the beginning.

311
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,900
- Yeah.
- Cool.

312
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,271
- <i>Gleaming Planet.</i>
- <i>Planet.</i>

313
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,838
<i>Gleaming Planet.</i>

314
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,499
Is that you flying through space?

315
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,943
No. She's just a character
from those books that I like.

316
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:26,915
- Really stupid.
- No, if you like it, ifs not stupid.

317
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,311
What makes her so special?

318
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:34,380
She's in charge of this thing
called the Neexo Ark.

319
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,553
And ifs up to her
to escape the Dark Galaxy...

320
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,926
and save
the Gleaming Planet star system.

321
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,099
Yeah. I don't know.

322
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,898
I know ifs odd and stuff...

323
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:52,408
but she's actually... really awesome.

324
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,102
She's kinda my hero.

325
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:58,113
You will be my hero if you can
help me outwith this geometry business.

326
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:01,616
I have no idea What I'm doing.

327
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:04,950
- Is this the right book?
- Yes.

328
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,887
How much of it have you studied?

329
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,982
“Studied.” That's a strong word.

330
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,064
Angle “C” and angle

331
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,928
are complementary-

332
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,695
Complementary. Got it. Got it.

333
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,600
Man, you're a Wonderful teacher,
Ms. Finecky.

334
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,071
- So you understand it?
- Yeah.

335
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,873
What I don't understand
is why I need to know this stuff.

336
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,640
Seriously, like, who, like, calc-

337
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,943
Coplanar lines and angles and stuff?

338
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,644
Who calculates slopes at a job?

339
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,379
- Aimee?
- Who needs this shit?

340
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,184
Come on out here right now, will ya.

341
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,850
Thought you was gonna get us some milk.

342
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:46,088
- I will.
- Do it now, for Christ's sake!

343
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,023
I am so sorry.

344
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,600
It's okay.

345
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,192
- I should probably-
- Yeah-

346
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:57,570
Hey, there's a party oh Saturday,
and I think that you should go with me.

347
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,133
- Me?
- Yeah.

348
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,212
- What?
- Yeah, I'll come by and pick you up.

349
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,780
How's that sound?

350
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,283
Okay?

351
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,216
- Is that an answer or a question?
- No. It's an answer.

352
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,586
- If you don't Want to go-
- No, I do.

353
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,592
I would like that.
Thank you.

354
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,860
- Do you Want me to carry that?
- I got it.

355
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,437
- You good?
- Yeah.

356
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:53,682
See the Water?
Do not go in there.

357
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,692
Too disgusting.
I think people poop in there. Here.

358
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,762
- I'm good. I don't really drink.
- Just hold it.

359
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,830
It gives off the illusion
you're having fun.

360
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,263
You don't have to drink it.

361
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,334
What's up, guys?
How you doing?

362
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,498
This is Aimee Finecky.
I don't know if you guys know her.

363
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,506
Cody, you're a reader, aren't you?

364
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,578
<i>Have you read those
Gleaming Planet books'?</i>

365
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,271
- One or two.
- One or two?

366
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,576
I forgot to tell you,
I started reading one last night.

367
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,582
- You did?
- Yeah. It was really cool.

368
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,745
- Which one?
- The one Where Shirei Migoto...

369
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,517
fights that cosmic superlord
and starts fucking him up.

370
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,058
- I know! Right? Shes awesome.
- She <i>is</i> awesome.

371
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:32,719
I love those books.
Have you read <i>Solar Bolt?</i>

372
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,162
Yeah. Solar Bolt is great.

373
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:38,291
There's so many awesome,
rad parts between-

374
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:42,161
Sorry to interrupt.
I don't think we've met.

375
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,830
I'm Sutter Keely.

376
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,167
- I'm Cassidy.
- How's it going?

377
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,902
- That's a nice handshake.
- Thank you.

378
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,172
Do you Want to go get a beer with me?

379
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,248
- I'm having a conversation right now.
- She'll be here.

380
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,078
You'll be here, right?
We'll come back.

381
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:57,085
- We're just gonna grab a beer. Come on.
- You're unbelievable.

382
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,382
- I will be back.
- Please. Thank you.

383
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,322
Don't smile at me like that.

384
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:05,952
I can't help myself.
You know that I can't help myself.

385
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,359
Please.

386
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,927
- Maybe just-
- Cassidy?

387
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,560
- Hey!
- Hey.

388
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,161
- Sutter.
- Marcus.

389
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,839
I gotta get going.

390
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:22,775
- You riding with me?
- Yeah.

391
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,370
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

392
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,974
- It was good to see you.
- Next time.

393
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:50,840
Just a flick of the wrist.
It's done in half the time.

394
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,667
Hey. What's up, man?

395
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,267
- What's up?
- Everything cool?

396
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,846
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

397
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:00,850
I was gonna go for a walk.
You wanna come with me'?

398
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,647
- Yeah. I would love to.
- All right. Cool.

399
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:04,948
- All right.
- Cheers.

400
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:07,717
- Nice to meet you.
- It was good to meet you.

401
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:16,132
- I'm sorry if that guy was bugging you.
- No, he's fine.

402
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,132
- Totally fine.
- Yeah? Okay.

403
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,861
Are you done?

404
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,935
- Can I try that?
- What, this?

405
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,771
- This is pretty serious stuff.
- Just a taste.

406
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,869
Are you sure?
All right. Here you go.

407
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:33,108
Go for it.
It's pretty strong.

408
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,942
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

409
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,747
Yeah, I know.
I know! I told you.

410
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,688
- How do you drink that?
- I don't know.

411
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,624
I've just been doing it for a While.
I don't know.

412
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,928
- You know who gave me my first beer?
- Who?

413
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,259
- My dad.
- Really?

414
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,925
Yeah. I was probably six years old.

415
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:56,130
Used to take me to baseball games
every Saturday and let me have sips.

416
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,469
- Did you get drunk?
- No, I didn't get drunk.

417
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:01,305
But it tasted really nice.
It felt warm.

418
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,681
Where is he now, your dad?

419
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,510
- He's an airline pilot.
- Really?

420
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:09,142
- Yeah, he flies all across the country.
- That's awesome.

421
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:14,088
He <i>is</i> awesome. I don't know What he was
doing with my mom for that long, but-

422
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,852
Are they divorced?

423
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,791
Yeah. She made him leave us
a long time ago.

424
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,990
- You Want some more? Try it?
- Sure.

425
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,395
Yeah? Why not?

426
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:27,561
- Sounds like we have the same mom.
- Yeah? How so?

427
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,730
Well, for example...

428
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:33,605
I got into college today, but there's
no Way that my mom will let me go.

429
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,076
You got into college today?
That's awesome!

430
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:39,947
- Yeah. Thank you. In Philadelphia.
- Congratulations.

431
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,917
Which is really cool, 'cause that's
Where my sister lives, but-

432
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,750
I don't know What to say.
Dude, that's awesome.

433
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:49,121
- Congratulations. Very cool.
- It's not that big of a deal.

434
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,353
And there's no Way that I'll go, so-

435
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:54,862
- What are you talking about?
- I have to help my mom with the route.

436
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:58,423
What does your mom have to do
with this? The paper route?

437
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:01,299
- Yes. She's alone-
- Your mom is a grown woman.

438
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,033
She can take care of
the paper route herself.

439
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,632
You are definitely going to Philly.

440
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,871
A hundred percent,
you're going to Philly.

441
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,641
- Yeah, no.
- Yeah, you are.

442
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,977
There's no “buts” about it.
Don't you understand?

443
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,144
You are this incredibly
gifted genius person...

444
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,246
and you got all these people around you
telling you that you can't do shit.

445
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:23,622
And that's gotta stop. You need
to start standing up for yourself.

446
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,695
- How?
- How? I'll teach you.

447
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,764
Take another swig of that stuff.

448
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,295
Get that clown there.
Down the hatch!

449
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,700
Now repeat after me.

450
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:37,637
Mom, get off my motherfuckin' back.

451
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,142
- What?
- Yes.

452
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,369
- No!
- Yeah.

453
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,104
- I can't-
- Say it.

454
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,180
Mom, get off of my back.

455
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,012
No. You gotta do the “motherfucking.”

456
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,177
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

457
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,484
- Do it. Say it.
- Mom, get off of my fucking back.

458
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:55,922
- Motherfucking.
- Fuck! Motherfuck!

459
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,534
- Go! Motherfuck-Yes!
- Motherfucking!

460
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,459
Get off my motherfucking back, Mom!

461
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,791
<i>'</i> Yes!
<i>*</i> God!

462
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,057
- God!
- Yeah!

463
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,565
- Motherfuckin'! That's good!
- That feels awesome!

464
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,567
Who else? Who else? I like this.

465
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,571
I don't know-Stay out
of my motherfucking business, Kristal!

466
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,902
- Fuck you, Kristal.
- Yeah, fuck you-

467
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,941
What about ex-boyfriends?

468
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,878
- We need an ex-boyfriend in there.
- No. I don't have any.

469
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,543
Who's an ex-boyfriend that really
pissed you off that you should-

470
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,144
that you hated and they're just-

471
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,722
I don't have an ex-boyfriend.

472
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,119
- What?
- Yeah.

473
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,955
You're 17 years old.
You don't have an ex-boyfriend?

474
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,586
- No. Guys don't look at me like that.
- That's shocking.

475
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:38,134
Absolutely, guys look at you like that.
I just saw two guys look at you like that.

476
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,533
Erik Wolff and Cody Dennis
were 100% hitting on you.

477
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,605
- We were just talking.
- A hundred percent.

478
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,605
- There was absolutely no way-
- Yes, they Were.

479
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,607
Why don't you think
they were hitting on you?

480
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,974
- Because I'm just-They weren't.
- Because you're What?

481
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,479
- You're absolutely beautiful.
- Oh, my God. No!

482
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,918
<i>Of course you're going to the prom.</i>

483
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,925
<i>I'll take you.</i>

484
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,000
Please go to the prom with me, Aimee!

485
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,004
Yes.

486
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,504
<i>You're taking her to prom?</i>

487
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,770
Yeah. It's no big deal.

488
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,847
It's you making plans, Sutter.
It's kind of a big deal.

489
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:02,248
Relax. I'm just trying
to help this girl out.

490
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,014
- Right. I forgot. Sutter to the rescue.
- Exactly!

491
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:11,652
And if she falls for you,
What happens then?

492
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:15,554
Shut up!

493
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,830
Are you kidding me?

494
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,197
<i>Hey, Sutter. It's Aimee.</i>

495
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:28,072
<i>I didn't know if we were
gonna study today or not...</i>

496
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,272
<i>but I hadn't heard from you, so-</i>

497
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,007
<i>Yeah, yesterday-</i>

498
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,484
<i>I had a really great time with you.</i>

499
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,077
<i>Thank you.</i>

500
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,922
<i>I'll talk to you later. Bye.</i>

501
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,115
Or the lightning storm.

502
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,692
On the roof.

503
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,661
That was amazing.

504
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,960
I've never felt like that with anyone.

505
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,965
It's not very often.

506
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:26,763
Except with you.

507
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:30,599
Actually, I think
I'm feeling it right now.

508
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,174
I'm feeling a moment right now.

509
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,334
- Stop it.
- What? Cass, look. Seriously.

510
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:38,175
When we're together,
it's like we're invincible or something.

511
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:42,411
All this shit-the responsibilities,
all the problems, that stuff-

512
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,851
that just disappears
when I'm with you.

513
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:48,584
But you can't just have fun all the time.
You have to be serious.

514
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,751
Hey, I'm 100% serious.

515
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,853
- About What?
- About not being serious.

516
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,192
Did you even apply to college yet?

517
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,395
I don't need college.
Who needs that shit?

518
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:04,132
Look, ifs not-
I got everything I need right here.

519
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:05,970
I've got a job, I've got a car...

520
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,408
I've got a beautiful girl
sitting next to me.

521
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:11,673
You think beauty's in some classroom
or some textbook, and ifs not.

522
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:14,340
That's not What ifs about.
This right here.

523
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,885
This is beautiful. All of this.

524
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,223
That's all you need.

525
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,522
You're drunk.

526
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,857
I'm drunk?
Whatever! You're drunk!

527
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,726
It doesn't matter.

528
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,733
Okay, Whatever.
I'm right-You're right.

529
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,928
I'm just saying,
you gotta live in the moment.

530
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,527
The moment?

531
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:42,903
I want-
I Want more than a moment.

532
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,981
- I want-
- What?

533
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,775
I Want a future.

534
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,088
And you can't do that.

535
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:05,991
Wow.

536
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,596
Wow.

537
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,805
Please just go, Sutter.

538
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:22,350
- Don't.
- Please just go.

539
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,621
All right.

540
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:47,376
What's up with you and Cassidy?

541
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,741
- I don't want any trouble.
- Tell me the truth.

542
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:52,640
Nothings up, man.

543
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,648
She's moved on.
I've moved on.

544
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,878
- You've moved on?
- We hang out, and we have-

545
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,716
Okay! Come on.

546
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,017
We have fun,
but there's nothing going on.

547
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,716
I promise you.

548
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,604
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

549
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:19,698
Why can't it be me
that she has fun with?

550
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:22,710
- What?
- Why cant it be me that she has fun with?

551
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,406
I'm not like you.
I don't know how to make her laugh.

552
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,915
Dude, you are Marcus West, man.

553
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,542
You're the star athlete.

554
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,881
You're the class president.
You are awesome!

555
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,422
Whats the name of that charity
that you started?

556
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,889
The Hope Squadron.

557
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,654
The fucking Hope Squadron, man!
That is awesome!

558
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,128
You do not need my help.
You're the man.

559
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:44,962
No, ifs not the same.
The Way she talks about you, man.

560
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,468
I want her to like me like that,
and she doesn't.

561
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:49,765
Trust me.
You don't Want to be like me.

562
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:54,609
I make jokes, yeah.
But, I mean, you get shit done.

563
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,576
You're gonna change the World.

564
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,977
You and Cass are perfect together.
Trust me.

565
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,516
You're just too tense, man.
A little tense.

566
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:04,746
- You gotta loosen up. You know?
- Yeah. Maybe.

567
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:07,083
- Not everything has to be so serious.
- Yeah.

568
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:09,624
I'm just saying you can relax.
You know?

569
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,354
You're awesome.
Enjoy being who you are.

570
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,794
Live in the now.
Embrace that shit.

571
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,032
Yeah.

572
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,466
Hey, thanks for-

573
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,598
Thanks for talking to me like this.
I appreciate it.

574
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:25,334
- Absolutely, man. It's a pleasure.
- I appreciate it. I really do.

575
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,433
- Anytime.
- Sorry about the-

576
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,705
it's cool. Good.

577
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,851
- They're Wrong about you.
- Whats that?

578
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,954
You're not the joke
everyone thinks, man.

579
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,435
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

580
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,013
The king of Mexico?

581
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,014
You're not gonna jerk
your Way out of this.

582
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,779
Aimee told me about
your little party by the lake.

583
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,979
- And?
- And now you're avoiding her.

584
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:13,919
- I'm not avoiding her.
- Really?

585
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,252
Have you seen her since the party?
Have you even called?

586
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:19,954
Why don't you get off my back
a little bit, give me some space.

587
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,657
I knew she got that from you.
She said the exact same thing.

588
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:25,290
- Good. Good for her.
- No, ifs not good for her.

589
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,369
Aimee isn't like you.
She's a sweet girl.

590
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,495
She doesn't need you
causing problems in her life.

591
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:30,902
What Aimee doesn't need...

592
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:33,395
is you bossing her around
like she's your personal assistant.

593
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:35,811
You shouldn't treat her this Way.

594
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,504
Thank you. Good talk.

595
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,160
- Hi.
- Hey.

596
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,331
- What's up?
- Nothing.

597
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,908
What are you doing? I didn't know
you were coming over today.

598
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,571
I wasn't planning on coming over,
but I was driving around and I thought...

599
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,877
I don't care how busy I am,
I should see What Aimee is doing.

600
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:16,918
So, how are you doing, Aimee?

601
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,887
I'm good. I'm really good.
How are you, Sutter?

602
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,547
- I'm good.
- Good.

603
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,125
Yeah. Hey, listen.

604
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:26,161
My sister, she's having
this fancy dinner party for her friends...

605
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,287
and she's making me go.

606
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,458
- I didn't know you had a sister.
- Yeah. We're not really that close.

607
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,928
But would you Want to go with me?

608
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,835
- To dinner?
- Yeah.

609
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,067
- Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
- Okay. Cool.

610
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,836
Yeah. What time?

611
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,243
- Ten minutes.
- Ten minutes from now?

612
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:45,712
- Yeah.
- Okay.

613
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:59,118
So then I go
back up to the table and I say...

614
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,493
“Can I get you boys anything else?”

615
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:03,657
And then he says-

616
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:06,132
I'm gonna let you say it.
What did you say?

617
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,966
I leaned back in my chair,
puffed my chest out and said...

618
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,631
“You can give me
your number, gorgeous.”

619
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:15,233
That's right. And I didn't even know
that he was a big, fancy lawyer.

620
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,472
I just gave it to him anyway.

621
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,412
And I am so glad that I did.

622
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:23,144
And she hasn't worked
a day in her life since.

623
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,879
He's right. That's true.

624
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,490
Wow. You guys sure are
a breath of fresh air.

625
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,693
Thank you, Sutter.

626
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:34,058
It's rare to see
such a happy couple nowadays.

627
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:36,222
I feel like everyone's getting divorced.

628
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,322
Well, that's not true.

629
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,925
Isn't it'? Our parents.

630
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,665
Aimee's parents.
Most of my friends' parents.

631
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,139
- Kids got a point.
- Thank you, Joe.

632
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,709
Mine didn't.

633
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,778
- I thought your parents were divorced.
- No.

634
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:53,041
There you go, Sutter. See?
Not everything is doomed.

635
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:56,375
My dad died.

636
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,851
What?

637
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,682
I am so sorry.

638
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,192
No. It's okay.
It's not your fault.

639
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,024
What happened?

640
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,756
He was a really great guy.

641
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:13,495
He just kind of had
a slight problem with painkillers mostly.

642
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,161
Yeah.

643
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,800
Kinda crazy.
He tried to stop a bunch of times.

644
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,933
But my sister came home one day...

645
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,638
and he was lying
on the kitchen floor...

646
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:26,578
and she had to close his eyes
and everything.

647
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:29,550
It was pretty... intense.

648
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:35,222
Sorry.
That was... really dark.

649
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:39,223
Anyway, that's just-
I know that my marriage will work.

650
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,887
Oh, yeah?

651
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,056
I've thought it all out.

652
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,226
My husband and I
will both live on a horse ranch...

653
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,362
and I will work for NASA.

654
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,940
And he'll do something
completely different.

655
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,509
So that we offset each other.
You know?

656
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,339
We'll have some things in common...

657
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,472
but then we'll also bring all these
different dimensions to the table...

658
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,813
so that, you know,
life doesn't get boring.

659
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,178
I know ifs gonna work.

660
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,279
Sounds like a dream.

661
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:12,886
I think ifs good to have dreams.
Don't you?

662
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:16,560
Yeah.

663
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,360
- To dreams.
- To dreams.

664
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,845
- I wanna ask you something.
- Okay.

665
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,274
Did you mean What you said at the party?

666
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,909
What?

667
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,621
- What?
- You know!

668
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,213
- No, I don't.
- Yes.

669
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:46,557
Like, the thing about the prom
or Whatever.

670
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,959
Yeah, of course I remember that.
Are you kidding me?

671
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,056
How could I forget something like that?

672
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,295
No, I just mean, like...

673
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:58,966
if you'd changed your mind or you
didn't Want to go, I'd totally get it.

674
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,634
- What are you talking about?
- No, I just-

675
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,872
I wouldn't have asked you to go
if I didn't Want to go with you.

676
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,313
- I know.
- I wouldn't-

677
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,884
I wouldn't have.

678
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:14,513
I'm just saying that I know people
change their minds.

679
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,592
- It's not that big of a deal.
- Not me.

680
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,753
And I'm totally okay with it
if you Want to not go.

681
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,923
I would not have asked you
to go to the prom...

682
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:27,059
if I didn't Want
to go to the prom with you.

683
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,735
- Really?
- Really.

684
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,645
Come here.

685
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:38,972
Come here.

686
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,422
- Bye.
- Bye.

687
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:52,417
What?
Look, man. It's under control.

688
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,496
What's under control?

689
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:58,192
Did it ever cross your mind
that maybe I'm attracted to that girl?

690
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,200
No. No, not at all.

691
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,067
Yeah, that's because
you haven't really looked at her.

692
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,073
I'm telling you,
once you actually talk to her...

693
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:08,143
you see who she is.

694
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,405
I don't know, man.
She's really beautiful.

695
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,582
“Beautiful”?
This isn't you, Sutter.

696
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:15,651
- What, dude?
- You're gonna break her heart.

697
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:20,347
Well, worst-case scenario, I'm just
giving her the boyfriend experience.

698
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,653
That's worst-case scenario?
No Way. No.

699
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:26,091
Okay, well-I don't know.

700
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:29,096
You and I both know a month, tops,
she'll be done with me.

701
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:32,099
- Then she'll move on.
- Then if she doesn't, What happens?

702
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:34,567
If she doesn't, that'll be a first.

703
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,682
I like you so much.

704
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:49,141
<i>I like you.</i>

705
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:55,390
Should we take our shirts off?

706
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,426
Yeah.

707
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,193
You go first.

708
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:02,764
All right.

709
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,508
- Voila.
- You're amazing.

710
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,512
So amazing.

711
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,875
Your turn.

712
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,974
- I have to take mine off?
- Yeah.

713
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,110
Don't laugh. Okay?

714
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,280
Okay. I promise I won't laugh.

715
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,324
- Wow.
- Stop. No. You promised.

716
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:30,892
- What?
- Don't say anything.

717
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,018
Are you kidding me?
That's awesome.

718
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:52,870
I like you, Sutter...

719
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,373
so much.

720
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,664
Do you wanna do this?

721
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,330
- Yeah.
- Okay.

722
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,877
Do you? Yeah? Okay.

723
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,445
Hold on.

724
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,008
- Here.
- Wow.

725
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,848
- Where did you even get this from?
- I don't know.

726
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:35,253
It's better.
Good to be safe, huh?

727
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,085
Got all your bases covered.

728
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,857
You got it?

729
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,832
- Yeah.
- Do you need any help?

730
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,029
- No.
- Are you sure?

731
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,037
You okay?

732
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,108
- Yeah.
- Okay.

733
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:12,327
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

734
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:13,724
Nothing.

735
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,127
- You wanna do it?
- Yeah.

736
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,961
- Hey.
- Yeah?

737
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:20,035
I'm so glad that I met you.

738
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,271
I'm so glad that I met you too.

739
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,819
Go slow. Go really slow.

740
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,389
Okay?

741
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:45,793
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

742
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,362
It's okay.

743
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:52,067
- You okay?
- Yeah.

744
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:41,249
Tell you a secret?

745
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:42,840
What?

746
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,978
- My dads not a pilot.
- What?

747
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:51,389
Yeah, I actually don't know
What my dad does or Where he is.

748
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,594
- What? Sutter.
- Yeah.

749
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:59,100
I just made that up because
hes been gone for half my life and...

750
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,329
I guess I just miss him.

751
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,269
Oh, my God.

752
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:06,341
No one knows Where he is?

753
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:10,173
My mom knows Where he is,
but she won't tell me.

754
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,473
- What?
- Yeah.

755
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,912
She can't keep him from you.
He's your dad.

756
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:16,143
I know. She does. She has.

757
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,311
Sutter, that's not, like-

758
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:22,188
What?

759
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,815
Yeah.

760
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,563
I'll make you a deal.

761
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,495
I will stand up to my mom
if you'll stand up to yours.

762
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:38,072
What do you think?

763
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,372
I think...

764
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,446
that you're wonderful.

765
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:51,676
Can I look?

766
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,660
- Sorry I didn't get you a limo.
- That's okay.

767
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,786
But this...

768
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:03,665
is my Way of making it up to you.

769
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:06,564
- You did not have to get me anything.
- I know. I Wanted to.

770
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:08,831
I wrapped it.

771
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:10,405
- Should I open it?
- Yeah.

772
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,996
- You wrapped this?
- In newspaper.

773
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:15,133
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you. Took me forever.

774
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:16,836
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

775
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,914
I don't know What it is, but thank you.

776
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,849
- What?
- Yeah! I know. Do you like it?

777
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,450
- I love it!
- Do you? All right. Good.

778
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:29,524
- It has my name on it?
- Uh-huh.

779
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,462
- Thank you.
- Glad you like it. You're welcome.

780
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:37,158
- You did not need to do this.
- I know, but the best part is, it's full.

781
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:39,925
- It <i>is</i> full.
- Yeah. Mostly.

782
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,304
- Did you take a sip?
- I took a sip, made sure it Worked.

783
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,363
- For good luck?
- Yup.

784
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:45,940
- Ready?
- Yeah.

785
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,269
- Cheers.

00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:16,432

00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:18,005

00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,061
- Okay?
- Yeah. Thank you.

793
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,527
- She's a good dancer.
- Who?

794
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:49,229
- Cassidy.
- I didn't notice.

795
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:52,766
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

796
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,618
Why aren't you guys dancing?

797
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:17,699
- We're gonna get out there next song.
- Come on. It's prom.

798
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,166
- Aimee, dance with me.
- No. I'm good.

799
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:23,170
- I don't really dance.
- Lucky for you, I'm a phenomenal dancer.

800
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,140
- I can teach you some stuff.
- No, I'm fine.

801
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,868
You guys should go.

802
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:32,038
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

803
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:35,440
All right. Good.

804
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:38,920
Have fun.

805
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:47,387
She looks very nice.
Have you turned her into a lush yet?

806
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,192
Do you Want to lecture me about it,
or you wanna dance?

807
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:51,823
Okay. I wanna dance.

808
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,908
Pump the arms.
Pump the arms.

809
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,070
Yep. That's What we're doing.

810
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,321
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

811
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,763
God, this is awesome.

812
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:27,499
Seriously, like,
everybody's just singin'...

813
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:29,696
and dancing...

814
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:31,773
and falling in love.

815
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,075
I'm so happy.

816
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:41,547
I mean, this, like-this is our night.

817
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:44,209
This is the youngest
that we're ever gonna be.

818
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,862
I love these people.

819
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:57,591
I do. I love these people.
I love you all!

820
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:04,065
Come on. Dance with me.
Come on.

821
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:24,888
Sorry I don't know
how to dance like Cassidy.

822
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:27,655
You dance like Aimee.
That's perfect.

823
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:48,982
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

824
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:50,745
Guess what!

825
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,616
My sister called me today...

826
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:56,782
and she said that she could probably,
almost 100% likely...

827
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,917
get me a job at the bookstore.

828
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:00,494
- In Philadelphia?
- Yes!

829
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:03,656
- That's awesome. You love books.
- I know! It's perfect.

830
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:06,700
- That's the perfect job for you.
- It really is.

831
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:11,330
It'll help pay for college, and-
Yeah.

832
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:14,739
- You talk to your mom yet?
- No.

833
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:18,677
But I will... eventually.

834
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:25,686
It's pretty.

835
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,658
Sorry.

836
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,727
Come here. Sorry.

837
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:37,698
So abusive.

838
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,525
Sorry.

839
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,302
Back to What I was saying.

840
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:47,568
I have been thinking...

841
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,940
a lot recently-

842
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:52,513
a lot more than normal-

843
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:55,640
and I think that you
should come with me.

844
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,547
- To...
- Philly.

845
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:01,282
- Philly.
- Yes. Yes!

846
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:03,858
I've been looking all into it.

847
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:06,894
And you can go to the junior college...

848
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:10,328
and we could both get jobs downtown.

849
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,730
It could be really awesome.

850
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:15,803
Have you ever been to Philly?
Have you seen the Liberty Bell?

851
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:19,066
- No.
- I haven't either, but-

852
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:21,870
but the pictures of it
are really beautiful.

853
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:23,945
It's awesome.

854
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,674
You've been thinking about this
for a While, haven't you?

855
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:29,182
I have. I have. Yeah.

856
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:33,379
And the coolest thing ever, also,
when I was talking to my sister-

857
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:36,821
- Besides the Liberty Bell?
- Yes. There's so many cool things!

858
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:40,952
She said that there's, like,
tons of vacancies avail-

859
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,361
- Listen to me. I'm talking.
- I'm listening.

860
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:47,697
She said there's tons of vacancies
available in her building...

861
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:50,772
because of the economy
and stuff, so-

862
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,363
We could totally just move there...

863
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:55,443
at the end of June, together.

864
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:59,207
And it would be really inexpensive
and awesome and-

865
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:02,877
What do you think?

866
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:07,311
I think that's great.

867
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,754
- Really?
- Yeah.

868
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,663
I did it.

869
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,291
- What?
- Talked to my mom.

870
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:23,167
I walked in and said...

871
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,780
“ifs my life, and I'm not gonna
let you stand in the Way of it.”

872
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:28,275
- How'd that go?
- It was ugly at first.

873
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:31,175
Said all these things
and tried to guilt me into staying...

874
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:35,478
but I just said, “Look,
if I can afford it, then I'm leaving...

875
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:38,348
and there's really not anything
you can do about it.”

876
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,421
That's awesome.
I'm proud of you.

877
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,421
Thank you.
I'm proud of me.

878
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:45,457
It wasn't that bad.
You'll see.

879
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:47,459
- What?
- When you do it.

880
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:50,690
- What are you talking about?
- Sutter! We had a deal.

881
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,734
Yeah. I don't know.

882
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:56,804
What? You can totally do it.
Trust me.

883
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:58,600
- Different.
- No.

884
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,606
Okay, look. Repeat after me.

885
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:04,440
Say, “I want to call my dad, Mom.
I want to motherfucking call him.”

886
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:07,813
That's not fair.

887
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,647
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

888
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:17,748
- Just wanted to ask you something.
- Okay. What is it?

889
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:19,326
It's about Dad.

890
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:23,091
- Oh, Sutter.
- I wanna talk to him.

891
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:25,996
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why not?

892
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,304
- He's my dad.
- And I'm your mom...

893
00:55:29,392 --> 00:55:31,531
and you live under my roof.

894
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:33,608
I just wanna call him.

895
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:39,337
This is my job. We can have
this conversation later. Okay?

896
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,984
No wonder he left you.

897
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:01,268
How do you like the landscaping
we did back here?

898
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,202
Joe and I planted day lilies.
I don't know if you saw them.

899
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:06,399
- Yeah, it looks really good.
- Really pretty.

900
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:09,575
Hey, Holl, I was talking on the phone.

901
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,646
I wanted to ask you about Dad.

902
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,147
- You wanna dredge that up, huh?
- “Dredge”?

903
00:56:14,237 --> 00:56:17,878
Dads not somebody that you dredge.
He's awesome.

904
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:22,256
He used to tell us stories
in the tent in the backyard.

905
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:24,825
- You remember that?
- I think that was mostly you.

906
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:27,793
Do you remember when we
made that trip down to Mexico...

907
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,764
and he had us going up to people
asking where the Belt Buckle Museum was?

908
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:34,495
And why is there
no artichoke ice cream?

909
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:37,094
That was hilarious!
Don't look at-

910
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:39,469
- It was funny.
- It was embarrassing.

911
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,133
No, it wasn't. It was funny.
People loved us.

912
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:46,105
They loved <i>you</i>
because you were little and cute.

913
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:49,613
The guys liked you.
They loved you.

914
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:51,708
Thought you were
a hot little <i>muchacha.</i>

915
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:54,617
- You liked it.
- Well-

916
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:58,591
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- He knew how to make friends at least.

917
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,661
Damn right, he did.

918
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:06,829
So, do you know What happened
between him and Mom?

919
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,925
He cheated on her.

920
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:11,835
Yeah, well, that's her version of it.

921
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,498
And you think ifs a lie?

922
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:17,100
I don't think she's lying, but I think
there's two sides to every story.

923
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,679
- Think about it.
- Sutter-

924
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,510
She won't let us see him.
She won't even let us know Where he is.

925
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,885
Let's talk about something else.
How is your friend Aimee?

926
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:26,687
You gotta admit it's a little suspicious.

927
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:30,417
She won't even give me his phone number.
I can't talk to the guy.

928
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:36,324
Every time that I ask her for his number,
she refuses to give it to me.

929
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,094
Can you please ask her
for his number for me?

930
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:44,805
Please.

931
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,536
I don't have to ask her.

932
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:55,913
- I know Where he is.
- What?

933
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,744
Thank you. Thanks.

934
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,655
Thanks.

935
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:39,984
Hey, Sutter?

936
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:44,196
Come by for lunch sometime, okay?

937
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:47,526
Okay. I will. Promise.

938
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:13,394
<i>Hello.</i>

939
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:15,891
Dad?

940
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:17,965
<i>You got the wrong number.</i>

941
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:21,267
No, ifs me, Sutter.

942
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:22,836
<i>Sutter?</i>

943
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,773
<i>Sutter, how you doin'?</i>

944
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:30,572
Yeah, I'm all right.

945
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:34,809
<i>You sound like a man from here now.</i>

946
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:38,442
<i>Well, yeah, you-
Hey, you still playing ball?</i>

947
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:40,316
What?

948
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,912
<i>I mean, your arm.</i>

949
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:45,982
<i>You were small for your age,
but you were a hell of a pitcher.</i>

950
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,561
<i>You still playing ball?</i>

951
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:51,922
Wow. Yeah, I'm surprised
that you remember that, Dad.

952
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:56,765
<i>What are you talking about?
Of course I remember that.</i>

953
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:58,338
<i>You still throwing?</i>

954
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,966
No, not really.
Haven't thrown much lately.

955
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:05,706
<i>It's a shame. You were
a hell of a pitcher. You had a great arm.</i>

956
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:07,839
<i>So, how-</i>

957
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:12,215
<i>So how's your-
How's your mom and Holly doin'?</i>

958
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:15,050
They're good.
Yeah, real good.

959
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:19,251
<i>Good. That's tremendous, Son.
That's good. That's good.</i>

960
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,786
Listen, Dad-

961
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:27,760
Can I come see you sometime?

962
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:30,497
<i>Come see me?
Of course you can come see me.</i>

963
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:32,834
<i>What do you mean,
can you come see me?</i>

964
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:35,705
<i>You can come see me
any damn time you want to see me.</i>

965
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:39,245
- Really?
- <i>Of course you can come see me.</i>

966
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:44,444
<i>You come over like Friday around 3:00,
maybe we go see a game or something.</i>

967
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,281
Yeah. Wow. Really?

968
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:48,356
Dad, that would be so great.

969
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:50,583
I would really like that.

970
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:55,092
How much further is it?

971
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:56,822
It's about three hours.

972
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,094
Hey, Aim, thank you.

973
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:04,671
- For What?
- I wouldn't have done this Without you.

974
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:15,740
All right. Here we are.

975
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,488
I need that shot of whiskey now.

976
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,831
- Knock again?
- Yeah.

977
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:36,436
Yeah?

978
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:43,135
Dad, ifs Sutter.

979
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,880
Oh, shit. Of course.

980
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:48,574
You-Oh, man. I-

981
01:01:50,573 --> 01:01:52,211
Look at you.
Of course. You-

982
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:57,355
- You're taller than I am.
- Yeah, I grew a lot last summer.

983
01:01:57,447 --> 01:02:01,623
Yeah. You-I was-
No, I was just-

984
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,722
- I was-
- How are you? Come here.

985
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:06,300
- Hey.
- Hi.

986
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:12,230
- Hey. And who-
- Sorry. This is Aimee.

987
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:13,966
- Hi.
- This is my girlfriend.

988
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:15,736
- That's my dad.
- How do you do?

989
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:18,335
- Nice to meet you.
- It's very nice to meet you.

990
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:24,242
It's very nice to see that Sutter's got
immaculate taste in the ladies.

991
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,547
He gets that
from his old man, you know.

992
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:30,453
He gets that from his old man.
Look at you.

993
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:34,722
You caught me at a bad time.
Just headin' out.

994
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:36,797
I was gonna catch up with some friends.

995
01:02:36,886 --> 01:02:39,867
But since you're here,
if you wanna come along, that'd be great.

996
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,460
- Yeah.
- Would you like to do that?

997
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:45,630
- Yeah. I would love to, right?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

998
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:49,437
Is that all right? If you take your car,
you can follow me up there.

999
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:52,877
It's just up the street.
We'll go get a drink. Sound good?

1000
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:54,812
Yeah, cool. Let's do it.

1001
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:57,384
Hey, guys.

1002
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:01,046
This is my son, Sutter.
Sutter, this is the guys.

1003
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:04,921
And this is the most beautiful Woman
in the entire state.

1004
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:07,290
This is Roberta.
How you doin'?

1005
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:09,226
Last week you said “the country.”

1006
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:10,956
I meant the entire country.

1007
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:13,897
And this, again,
is the amazing Sutter Keely.

1008
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:17,335
Roberta.
And this is his amazing lady friend-

1009
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:19,929
- Aimee.
- Aimee.

1010
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,440
Get your good looks
from your mother, did ya?

1011
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,581
She can be touchy sometimes.

1012
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:37,055
Listen, go sit down over there.
I'll get us some drinks. All right?

1013
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:38,784
- The booth?
- Yeah.

1014
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,131
Hey, Sal.

1015
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,466
Give me two pitchers.

1016
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:54,671
You've never been to Key West?

1017
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:57,603
It's the place to be.

1018
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:03,651
Key West has got sunsets
that are like butterscotch sundaes...

1019
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:05,741
with strawberry swirl mixed in.

1020
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:08,083
And it just melts right into the ocean.

1021
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,885
And everybody has got
a drink in their hand...

1022
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:13,051
and a smile on their face.

1023
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:15,129
That's Key West.

1024
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:16,822
- Wow.
- That sounds perfect.

1025
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:18,398
- Yeah.
- It was perfect...

1026
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:20,990
and I wish you could have
been there with me.

1027
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,070
So how come you left?

1028
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:26,031
What do you mean, how come I left?

1029
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:28,165
How come you left Key West?

1030
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:32,111
I ran out of money.
That's why I left Key West.

1031
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:34,977
If I could have stayed down there,
I would have, believe me.

1032
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,721
Hey, I'm gonna play
a song on that jukebox.

1033
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:50,855
Good. Do that.
You do that, I'll get us a refill.

1034
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:52,432
All right.

1035
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:57,637
Good.

1036
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:05,701
Yes. That's it.
That's the song.

1037
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:23,788
<i>I wanna live fast,
love hard, die young</i>

1038
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:26,457
<i>And leave a beautiful memory</i>

1039
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:29,399
<i>I wanna live fast,
love hard, die young</i>

1040
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:30,971
Fresh pitcher.

1041
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,040
All right. Here we go.

1042
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:38,104
- Here you go, buddy.
- Thanks, Dad.

1043
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,706
- Miss Aimee.
- Thank you.

1044
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,252
It's pretty good, huh?

1045
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:47,651
- Thank you. What's that?
- The song.

1046
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:49,381
You like the song?

1047
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:50,957
This?

1048
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:53,959
Yeah, ifs all right.

1049
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:56,189
This was always
your mothers kind of thing.

1050
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,959
Mom? What do you-

1051
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:02,696
This is fun. I can't imagine Mom
listening to fun music like this.

1052
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,499
What the hell are you talking about?

1053
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:08,234
When I married your mother, your mother
was more fun than anyone I knew.

1054
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:10,311
Your mother was the definition of fun.

1055
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:12,379
There was nobody more fun than-

1056
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,778
Don't say anything bad
about your mother here, huh?

1057
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:22,617
So, What happened?

1058
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:25,726
What do you mean, What happened?

1059
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:30,356
Between you and Mom, What happened?

1060
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:34,027
Things didn't work out.
That's What happened.

1061
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,195
Yeah, well, she blames you for everything.

1062
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,566
I always defend you.

1063
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:45,669
I appreciate that, because you know What?
It wasn't all my fault.

1064
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:47,839
Yeah, exactly.
There's two sides to every story.

1065
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,939
- That's right.
- Yeah.

1066
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,019
And no matter What happened
between you guys...

1067
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:54,918
she shouldn't have kicked you
out of the house like that.

1068
01:06:57,246 --> 01:06:59,726
Your mother
didn't kick me out of the house.

1069
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,028
What do you mean?

1070
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:08,193
Your mother didn't kick me
out of the house. I left.

1071
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:14,433
Let me tell you something.

1072
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:18,171
I had to leave. I Wanted
to be there for you. I really did.

1073
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,482
More than anything in the world,
I Wanted to.

1074
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:23,550
You guys meant more to me than anything.

1075
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:27,746
But things between your mother and I,
they were very uncool.

1076
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:32,791
You could say I wasn't
out out to be a family man...

1077
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,361
not in the traditional sense.

1078
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,430
I did things that I'm not proud of.

1079
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:38,924
But I don't live in the past.

1080
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:41,797
I live in the now
because that's What ifs all about.

1081
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,802
Do you understand that?

1082
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,169
Yeah. Yeah.

1083
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:54,075
I think that might be a great idea.

1084
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,342
- Hey.
- Yeah?

1085
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:01,422
Do me a favor.
Pick up this tab. I'll be right back.

1086
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:07,421
Dad.

1087
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:10,156
I didn't even know you had a son.

1088
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:12,095
Thanks for that info.

1089
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:21,307
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1090
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:24,037
- It's okay.
- Gotta pay the tab.

1091
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:26,113
He doesn't have any money.

1092
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:32,413
- Do you have money?
- Yeah.

1093
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:34,010
This isn't enough.

1094
01:08:38,848 --> 01:08:41,158
- That's all you got?
- Listen-

1095
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,594
Roberta's had too much to drink...

1096
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:47,031
so I'm gonna give her a ride home,
if you know What I mean.

1097
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:49,763
- You Want us to follow you?
- No. There's no need for that.

1098
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:52,305
I won't be more than an hour.

1099
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:54,931
Dad, we're not doing anything.
We can totally come.

1100
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:57,533
No, that's not necessary.
You know what'd be best?

1101
01:08:57,633 --> 01:09:00,239
Just meet me
back at my place, all right?

1102
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:03,813
Yeah, Dad,
we came all this way to see you.

1103
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:05,886
I know you did, and I'm glad you did.

1104
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:09,388
But I'll meet you back at my place
in about an hour. Is that good?

1105
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,584
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's fine.

1106
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:15,719
- We can do that. Yeah.
- All right.

1107
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,991
- I'll see you then.
- Yep.

1108
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,341
We should head back.

1109
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:41,751
Let's keep waiting.
It's only been-Sutter!

1110
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,986
I'm sure that he Wanted to come back.

1111
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:26,997
If it wasn't for her,
I'm sure he would have come back.

1112
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:29,228
Yeah, and if he didn't
cheat on my mom...

1113
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:32,795
we'd still be a family, and I'd be
president of my Sunday school class.

1114
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,879
What?

1115
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:44,510
I love you.

1116
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:50,588
- Did you hear me?
- Yeah.

1117
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:53,023
- Sutter, I love you.
- No, you don't.

1118
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:56,529
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't. You're wrong.

1119
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,831
Sutter, I'm not wrong.

1120
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:01,697
- You don't love me.
- Yes, I do!

1121
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:03,770
You're wrong.
You don't love me.

1122
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:06,339
You're drunk and grateful
that somebody showed interest in you.

1123
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:10,001
Okay, stop. Stop.
Do not try and mess this up.

1124
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,010
Mess What up?
What do you think that this is?

1125
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,512
What are you talk-Sutter!

1126
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:24,284
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

1127
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,860
- What?
- Are you all right?

1128
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,656
- No.
- Are you hurt? Is there anything-

1129
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:31,789
Aimee, stop! No, I'm not.
I'm far from okay.

1130
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:33,423
- Jesus.
- Are you hurt?

1131
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:34,933
What is the matter with you?

1132
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:37,163
I almost killed you,
and you Want to know if I'm okay!

1133
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:40,672
- Yeah, I wanna make sure that you're okay.
- What the fuck is Wrong with you?

1134
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:44,506
Do you not see that I am bad for you?
You need to get away from me!

1135
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,637
You need to get the fuck away from me!

1136
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:49,341
Aimee, get-Get out of my car.

1137
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:51,384
No, I'm not gonna get out of your car!

1138
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:54,682
Get out of my car.
Get the fuck out of my car!

1139
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:58,054
- Get the fuck out of my car!
- Oh, my God, Sutter.

1140
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:00,754
Jesus Christ!

1141
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:02,556
I'm sorry, Sutter.

1142
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,653
Holy fuck! Aimee!

1143
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,982
Give you a choice, kid.
The cops or your parents.

1144
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:46,170
He's lucky.
So is his girlfriend.

1145
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:48,366
Not everyone gets a second chance.

1146
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,393
Now.

1147
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,922
It's not an

1148
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:52,470
- I thought you were gettin" help.
- I am.

1149
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:54,063
I am.

1150
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:58,570
You need a “C” on the final,
or you fail my class.

1151
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:01,510
I'll try harder.

1152
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:03,207
No, you won't.

1153
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:07,815
I don't get you, Sutter.
You're a smart kid, thoughtful.

1154
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:11,391
Do you even Want to graduate?

1155
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,983
I don't know.

1156
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:16,187
- Excuse me?
- I'm just being honest with you.

1157
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:19,266
I don't know.
Everyone's telling me I gotta move on.

1158
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:21,834
I don't see Whats so great
about being an adult.

1159
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:25,897
Are you happy?

1160
01:14:47,549 --> 01:14:48,857
Hi.

1161
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:55,561
Hey. How you feeling?

1162
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,637
I'm good. How are you?

1163
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:02,275
It's good to see you.

1164
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,313
Shall we talk about it?

1165
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:10,340
I agree.

1166
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:14,583
- I'm so sorry, Aimee.
- Sutter, stop.

1167
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,656
- Okay.
- It's okay.

1168
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:18,725
I know. It's okay.

1169
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:28,759
We can just pretend
that it never happened.

1170
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:31,167
We don't ever have
to talk about it again.

1171
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:34,834
I don't Want anything
to get in the Way of Philly.

1172
01:15:43,105 --> 01:15:45,176
You're all that matters to me.

1173
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,834
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

1174
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:10,933
- Look. Hi.
- Hi.

1175
01:16:12,334 --> 01:16:13,813
Hold this.

1176
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:27,693
Oops.

1177
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:40,169
- Want some?
- No. I'm okay.

1178
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:42,242
- Really?
- Yeah. I'm good.

1179
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:48,407
- Is your family here?
- Nah, I told them it was next week.

1180
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:52,614
Yup. Yeah.

1181
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:59,656
I should probably go say hi to her.

1182
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:15,434
We are so proud of you.

1183
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,248
Can you hold this?

1184
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,890
We made it.

1185
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:41,968
Yeah, I guess we did.

1186
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:45,495
- I'm really glad.
- Yeah.

1187
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,973
I'm really proud of you, Sutter.
Congratulations.

1188
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:52,942
When are you going to Texas?

1189
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:57,612
I thought that you heard.
I'm not going to Texas.

1190
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:01,783
I'm going with Marcus.

1191
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:03,720
California.

1192
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:06,616
- That's right.
- What?

1193
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:10,630
Come on, man.
Are you serious?

1194
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,966
I mean, don't you think that's a little-

1195
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:15,933
- What?
- I don't know.

1196
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:17,662
It seems a little-

1197
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:22,067
- You're really going?
- Yes, I'm really going.

1198
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:29,808
Well, maybe I'll, you know,
come visit you guys or something.

1199
01:18:29,905 --> 01:18:31,942
Never been to California.
It'd be cool.

1200
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:34,783
I don't think that's a good idea.

1201
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:38,716
Yeah. Yeah.

1202
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:40,816
Yeah, ifs probably not cool.

1203
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:43,260
Sorry. It's just-

1204
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:45,456
- I'm...
- Hey, I get it. It's cool.

1205
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:49,366
I'm trying to do things right now
that aren't bad for me.

1206
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:52,163
I get it.

1207
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:54,405
I get it.

1208
01:18:54,496 --> 01:18:56,476
It's cool. It's cool.

1209
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:09,887
I'm not mad at you.

1210
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:11,457
I know.

1211
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:18,731
You'll always be
my favorite ex-boyfriend.

1212
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:37,650
- Sutter.
- Yeah.

1213
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:39,719
Pop upstairs, would ya?

1214
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:48,151
You've probably noticed
we haven't been too busy these days.

1215
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:51,788
And because of that,
I can only keep one clerk.

1216
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:55,798
Now, I like you, Sutter...

1217
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:59,031
but more importantly,
the customers like you...

1218
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:02,438
so I think you should be the one I keep.

1219
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:04,010
That's excellent.

1220
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:05,874
One second.

1221
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:10,609
I've given this some hard thought,
and the only Way I can let you stay...

1222
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:13,311
is if you promise me 100%..

1223
01:20:13,408 --> 01:20:16,719
That you will never
come in here loaded again.

1224
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:20,851
And I'm serious.
Not even a light buzz.

1225
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:24,954
Because if you do,
then I have to let you go.

1226
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:26,532
You understand.

1227
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:28,868
I do.

1228
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:32,405
Can you promise?

1229
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,935
You got me there, Dan.

1230
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:41,903
You know I can't promise you that.

1231
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:48,982
Well, I appreciate your honesty.

1232
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:53,326
I've always been up front with you.

1233
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:01,500
Thanks for the opportunity.

1234
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:03,069
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1235
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:05,365
I suppose if I was your father...

1236
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:08,373
this is Where I might give you
a lecture or something...

1237
01:21:08,463 --> 01:21:11,501
about What you're doing to yourself.

1238
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,240
If you were my dad,
you wouldn't have to.

1239
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:36,800
<i>Bus 710 now boarding
for Washington, DC...</i>

1240
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,872
<i>Baltimore and Philadelphia.</i>

1241
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:23,374
Miss, I need to keep going.

1242
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:25,610
Just two more minutes, please.
I promise.

1243
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:28,017
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to go.

1244
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:30,089
Okay. Thanks.

1245
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:58,951
So, do you think I did the right thing?

1246
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:02,522
For you, or for her?

1247
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:07,292
You had to let her go.
You had to save that girl.

1248
01:23:07,382 --> 01:23:11,592
That's What I'm-
I saved her. I saved her.

1249
01:23:11,686 --> 01:23:13,222
You're not wrong.

1250
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:18,797
You're a hero.
You're a king.

1251
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:20,372
I'm a king.

1252
01:23:21,563 --> 01:23:23,565
I'm a king.

1253
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:26,077
Look at you, Sutter.

1254
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:29,148
What are you, 22, 23?

1255
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:30,716
Yeah.

1256
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:32,443
Beautiful.

1257
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:35,350
You got your whole life ahead of you.

1258
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:37,320
Hey, so do you, man.

1259
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:40,256
- You think so?
- Absolutely.

1260
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:42,419
Look at you. You're a young man.

1261
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:44,930
You're a kid.

1262
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,626
- I'm a kid?
- You got-

1263
01:23:47,722 --> 01:23:49,963
You got plenty of life left in you.

1264
01:23:50,058 --> 01:23:54,336
Hey. How 'bout we get a round of shots?

1265
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:56,238
For us kids.

1266
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:39,312
On, shit.

1267
01:24:41,943 --> 01:24:43,479
On, shit.

1268
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:47,726
What the hell-Sutter?

1269
01:24:48,783 --> 01:24:50,694
Jesus Christ.
We just Went through this.

1270
01:24:50,785 --> 01:24:53,629
- What the hell is Wrong with you?
- What do you care?

1271
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:57,794
- Excuse me?
- You've never cared about me.

1272
01:24:57,892 --> 01:25:00,998
Is it 'cause I remind you of him?
Is that why you hate me?

1273
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:03,406
You can't even stand
to look at me, can you?

1274
01:25:03,498 --> 01:25:05,478
What are you talking about?
You're my son!

1275
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:08,605
I'm his son too.
I'm exactly like him.

1276
01:25:09,471 --> 01:25:11,974
You are nothing like him.

1277
01:25:15,376 --> 01:25:18,289
I'll give you your dads number,
and you can go to him and see.

1278
01:25:18,379 --> 01:25:21,326
- See how different you are.
- I thought you didn't Want me to see him.

1279
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:24,886
I was trying to protect you from-

1280
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:28,297
I was wrong, okay?
So I Want you to go now.

1281
01:25:28,389 --> 01:25:29,891
I already Went.

1282
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:37,137
Holly gave me his number.
I drove up there last week and I saw him.

1283
01:25:37,232 --> 01:25:39,212
You were right, Mom.

1284
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,744
You were right the whole time.

1285
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:44,817
You are not your father.

1286
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:49,247
Sutter, listen to me.

1287
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:55,250
Listen to me. That man
has never loved anyone but himself.

1288
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:57,728
His heart is this big.

1289
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:00,959
But you love everybody.

1290
01:26:01,055 --> 01:26:03,661
You have the biggest heart
of anyone I know.

1291
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:07,204
When you were in third grade,
and Ricky was on crutches-

1292
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:10,333
Do you remember that?
You carried his books.

1293
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:13,241
Carried that backpack every day.

1294
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:16,645
And when you were nine
and Rosemary Clark lost her mother?

1295
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:19,150
You invited her to come live with us.

1296
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:22,380
You told her
that I would be her new mom.

1297
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:26,885
You've always been so special, Sutter.

1298
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:30,428
That's why everyone loves you so much.

1299
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:33,599
Nobody loves me.

1300
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:38,765
Sutter, you are so wrong.

1301
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,931
Do you hear me?
You are so wrong.

1302
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,679

I haven't had that many hardships.</i>

1304
01:27:32,347 --> 01:27:34,987

You know, shit's happened.</i>
