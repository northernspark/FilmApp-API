Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:11:53,327 --> 00:11:54,828
So what is it?

3
00:11:56,497 --> 00:11:57,789
Are you blind?

4
00:11:58,123 --> 00:11:59,416
It's a bomb.

5
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,418
Where's the fuse?

6
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:12,804
It's warm.

7
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:16,892
So am I. Come on.
I don't have all night.

8
00:12:45,796 --> 00:12:47,422
It's a dud.

9
00:12:48,882 --> 00:12:50,717
Let's get it on the truck.

10
00:12:51,385 --> 00:12:53,011
But how can we sell it now?

11
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,765
There's always someone
who'll buy this crap.

12
00:13:09,027 --> 00:13:13,115
I cannot stand all these questions
about my health.

13
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:19,329
I am to be described as
"robust" and "healthy".

14
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:49,158
Where you received
highest honors in English.

15
00:42:04,429 --> 00:42:05,764
Who did it?

16
00:42:05,973 --> 00:42:09,393
General Pildysh, General Mitkin.
Unhappy old Communists.

17
00:42:09,601 --> 00:42:11,436
Bastards.

18
00:42:11,645 --> 00:42:14,690
- Relieve them of command.
- I will shoot them myself.

19
00:42:14,898 --> 00:42:17,109
Just disappear them.

20
00:42:17,317 --> 00:42:21,613
Their execution would tell the world
I didn't have control.

21
00:42:21,822 --> 00:42:27,035
These days, better to appear guilty
than impotent.

22
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,604
Your scarf, monsieur.

23
00:47:10,944 --> 00:47:13,071
I expected this.

24
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,990
Really?

25
00:47:20,621 --> 00:47:22,080
What will you do?

26
00:47:22,289 --> 00:47:24,500
Nothing.

27
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:28,420
We will do nothing.

28
00:48:18,512 --> 00:48:21,473
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Mrs Spassky.

29
00:48:21,682 --> 00:48:24,184
At the end of the corridor.

30
00:48:30,357 --> 00:48:33,485
I haven't seen Sasha since university.

31
00:48:33,694 --> 00:48:38,824
And you were his teaching assistant?
Strange, I don't remember you.

32
00:48:39,032 --> 00:48:43,662
When he heard I was in Arzamas,
he asked me to look in on you.

33
00:48:46,915 --> 00:48:51,211
- He says he'll take me to the West.
- That would require a lot of money.

34
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,674
Just because the imbeciles here pay
him nothing doesn't mean others won't.

35
00:48:55,883 --> 00:48:58,844
He has a secret job.

36
00:48:59,887 --> 00:49:01,638
For the government?

37
00:49:01,847 --> 00:49:04,016
For imbeciles with money.

38
00:49:04,433 --> 00:49:10,022
Same nonsense, do this, don't do that.

39
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:12,483
They even told him
not to call his mother.

40
00:49:13,484 --> 00:49:14,693
The pigs.

41
00:49:14,902 --> 00:49:19,490
I could die any day
and he can't phone his mother.

42
00:49:19,698 --> 00:49:23,911
But my Sasha, he called.

43
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:26,205
Just last night.

44
00:50:52,624 --> 00:50:56,378
Ah, the warmth of plutonium decay.

45
00:50:56,587 --> 00:51:01,425
It's completely corroded.
At least you're wearing gloves.

46
00:51:08,682 --> 00:51:12,060
Anyone want to light up
an American cigarette?

47
00:51:13,061 --> 00:51:15,063
You're crazy.

48
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:19,902
I'm going out.

49
01:12:50,818 --> 01:12:52,653
Mr President...

50
01:12:52,861 --> 01:12:56,448
There's been a nuclear explosion in
America. You must come with us now.

51
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:58,534
What?

52
01:12:59,785 --> 01:13:04,039
We don't know who or how.
But it wasn't us.

53
01:13:04,248 --> 01:13:08,460
After Grozny you hope it wasn't us.

54
01:13:08,669 --> 01:13:11,171
We are drafting
a strong denial for you.

55
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:14,049
And a statement of sympathy.

56
01:13:14,258 --> 01:13:17,678
And Yuri... order all military
on the alert.

57
01:18:06,884 --> 01:18:08,760
Attention.

58
01:18:08,969 --> 01:18:11,096
You've heard of the bomb in the USA.

59
01:18:11,305 --> 01:18:13,599
What you haven't heard
is that 15 minutes ago

60
01:18:13,807 --> 01:18:18,061
an American ICBM hit Moscow.

61
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:25,277
We are to retaliate against an American
aircraft carrier in the North Sea.

62
01:18:25,486 --> 01:18:27,988
Man your aircraft.

63
01:18:50,928 --> 01:18:54,807
The ash isn't radioactive. The winds
are blowing the fallout to sea.

64
01:21:05,979 --> 01:21:10,651
But rest assured those responsible
will be dealt with most severely.

65
01:21:12,653 --> 01:21:15,113
He's fishing.

66
01:21:15,322 --> 01:21:17,282
Send our reply.

67
01:21:46,186 --> 01:21:51,733
...but we will protect ourselves
from further aggression.

68
01:21:53,026 --> 01:21:55,362
He thinks we did this.

69
01:21:55,571 --> 01:21:58,824
We must demonstrate
the strength of our weapons.

70
01:21:59,032 --> 01:22:04,663
They have to understand that
attacking Russia would be suicide.

71
01:22:04,872 --> 01:22:08,500
Increase the alert status.

72
01:23:57,484 --> 01:24:00,279
I ordered no such attack.

73
01:24:00,487 --> 01:24:03,282
You must not respond to this action...

74
01:24:13,959 --> 01:24:16,962
You dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.

75
01:24:17,171 --> 01:24:20,132
You dropped the bomb on Nagasaki.

76
01:24:20,466 --> 01:24:23,177
Do not lecture me on Chechnya.

77
01:32:10,853 --> 01:32:15,315
Eagles Nest, this is Eagle One.
We have target acquired. Target is lit.

78
01:32:30,497 --> 01:32:33,417
To make no response
is to invite a greater attack.

79
01:32:33,625 --> 01:32:37,588
American submarines from Norfolk
and Kings Bay are putting to sea.

80
01:32:37,796 --> 01:32:43,302
They carry Trident D3 missiles.
A first strike weapon.

81
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:46,054
Fowler is not so insane
as to launch a first strike.

82
01:32:46,263 --> 01:32:48,348
Perhaps he doesn't think
it's the first strike.

83
01:32:48,557 --> 01:32:52,478
Once their Stealth bombers go up,
we will have no choice.

84
01:32:52,686 --> 01:32:54,521
That will be the sign.

85
01:32:54,730 --> 01:32:57,107
How do we convince him
not to launch his bombers?

86
01:32:57,316 --> 01:33:02,529
- Maybe we should...
- Bring our missiles to highest alert.

87
01:33:02,738 --> 01:33:06,283
They'd be crazy to attack then.

88
01:37:35,928 --> 01:37:40,265
A nuclear strike on Colorado Springs
would take out NORAD.

89
01:37:40,474 --> 01:37:43,977
It would limit their ability
to launch a counter-attack.

90
01:37:44,186 --> 01:37:47,356
How many people live
in Colorado Springs?

91
01:37:48,482 --> 01:37:51,819
Three or four hundred thousand.

92
01:37:52,027 --> 01:37:55,906
Mr President, to use nuclear weapons
against the Americans...

93
01:37:56,114 --> 01:37:58,283
...would be to cross a threshold.

94
01:37:58,492 --> 01:38:04,957
They think we already have. Should
we now wait for them to annihilate us?

95
01:38:05,457 --> 01:38:10,045
I cannot stop what I did not start.

96
01:42:24,174 --> 01:42:25,926
Mr President.

97
01:42:26,135 --> 01:42:29,221
Their Stealth bombers
have left Aviano.

98
01:42:31,515 --> 01:42:34,518
That is the sign.

99
01:42:34,726 --> 01:42:38,063
Shoot them down.

100
01:42:42,109 --> 01:42:44,236
God protect us.

101
01:45:47,753 --> 01:45:49,922
How close are the bombers?

102
01:45:50,839 --> 01:45:56,929
They're slipping in and out of radar
over Poland.

103
01:46:00,974 --> 01:46:05,729
Activate the missile regiments.

104
01:47:57,424 --> 01:48:00,177
Type exactly what I say.

105
01:48:39,091 --> 01:48:43,262
This is madness. He is CIA.

106
01:48:43,470 --> 01:48:46,682
We cannot hang our fate
on the word of their spy.

107
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:50,853
What is the harm of listening
a bit more?

108
01:49:22,009 --> 01:49:25,304
You see? He is wasting time.

109
01:49:25,512 --> 01:49:27,764
We must launch now.
We have only moments.

110
01:49:59,171 --> 01:50:00,714
They cut him off.

111
01:50:01,715 --> 01:50:03,175
They are going to strike.

112
01:50:03,383 --> 01:50:06,470
Prepare the launch orders now.

113
01:50:07,305 --> 01:50:13,886
