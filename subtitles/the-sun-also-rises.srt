00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:27,787
One generation passes away...

3
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,829
and another generation comes...

4
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,490
but the Earth abides forever.

5
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:37,297
The sun also rises...

6
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,872
and the sun goes down...

7
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,908
and hastens to the place
where he arose.

8
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,093
This is Paris of today.

9
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,402
Our story deals with another Paris-

10
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,565
the Paris of 1922...

11
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:24,302
shortly after what used to
be called "the great war:"

12
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:31,843
We were part of that spectacular
lost generation of young people...

13
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:35,318
who continued to live
as though they were about to die.

14
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:39,619
Number 49 A venue de I'Opéra
was the center of our working world...

15
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,194
but we lived across the river
on the Left Bank...

16
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:46,288
in a bohemian world of poets,
painters and writers.

17
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,545
Merci.

18
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,048
Jake. Jake Barnes!

19
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:12,249
Hello, Jake. Good to see you!
How are you?

20
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,622
- Fine. Fine, thanks.
- You look fine.

21
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,695
You don't remember me, do you?

22
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,424
Harris, from the Ospedale Maggiore
in Milano.

23
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,729
Of course. I'm sorry.
You were with a bombardment squadron.

24
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:26,703
That's it. Had 10 operations,
and I still can't bend my knee.

25
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:29,832
- You about through now?
- Yeah, a couple of months more and then home.

26
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,969
They're never gonna see my face
this side of the water again.

27
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,378
- Hey, what are you still doing over here?
- Oh, I'm working.

28
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:40,248
Oh, that's right. I remember.
You were a newspaperman before the war.

29
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,321
So you decided to stay here, huh?

30
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,447
Well, that's not the way I'd play it.

31
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,685
I'm going home
even if it is too late to be a hero.

32
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,592
- Well, uh, good luck to you, Harris.
- Yeah, you too.

33
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,257
Uh, Barnes.

34
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,130
You're all right, aren’t you?

35
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,295
Yeah. Sure.

36
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,703
Uh, give me a call if you’re
gonna be in town for a while.

37
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,935
- We'll have a drink, huh?
- I'll do that.

38
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,705
- So long.
- So long, Jake.

39
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,351
- Good morning, Jake.
- Good morning, Ralph.

40
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,420
- Good morning, Mr. Barnes.
- Good morning, Mrs. Lloyd.

41
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,420
- Here are the cables.
- Thank you.

42
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:20,151
Mr. Jackson is anxious to know how you’re
coming along on the League of Nations piece.

43
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,787
Tell him I'll have it for him Sunday, and the
Woodrow Wilson piece some time next week.

44
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,296
Yes, sir.
You have a visitor. Mr. Cohn.

45
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,424
He insisted on waiting.

46
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,220
No, I can't do it.

47
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,232
I can't, Frances. I can't.

48
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,602
The book.

49
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:09,004
How do you expect me to write
when you keep after me this way?

50
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:12,544
- Can’t you understand, Frances?

51
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,103
Huh? Oh! Hi, Jake.

52
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:19,116
- Hello, Robert.
- Whoo! Must have fallen asleep. Sorry.

53
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,118
- Yes?

54
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,188
It's all right.

55
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,747
- Was I talking in my sleep?
- Uh-huh.

56
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,953
- Sorry. I must have been having a bad dream.
- Oh, Robert?

57
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,588
- No, thanks.

58
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,327
I wanted to talk to you.

59
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,029
I didn't get any sleep at all last night.

60
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,264
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

61
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,307
I haven't slept for weeks.

62
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,876
- Maybe you oughta see a doctor.
- I don't need a doctor.

63
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,309
I need to get away.

64
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:51,509
Everything's been going wrong, Jake-
Frances, the book.

65
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:54,347
- I can’t seem to do anything right.
- That happens to everybody.

66
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:58,413
I know. That's why
I want to get away for a while.

67
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,493
How would you like to go
to South America with me, Jake?

68
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,062
- Not much.
- Why not?

69
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,131
I don't know. It's expensive.

70
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,359
You see all the South Americans
in Paris anyway.

71
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,902
- Why don’t you take Frances?
- Ohh.

72
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,528
She wouldn't like it.

73
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,439
Look, if I handled both our expenses,
would you go?

74
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,977
No. I like Paris.

75
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,448
- Anyway, I always go to Spain in July.
- You can do that next year.

76
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,212
Why don’t you think about it, Jake?

77
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,288
All right, Robert. I'll think about it.

78
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,619
In the meantime,
I've gotta get out some cables.

79
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,420
Okay. I'll go.
How 'bout dinner tonight?

80
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,757
I'm sorry. I- I have a date.

81
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,831
Why don't we meet after dinner?

82
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,900
We're all going to that balmusette
on the Rue Sainte Geneviève.

83
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:45,437
- There's a dancing tonight.
- I'll see if I can make it.

84
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:51,901
Oh, I'm sorry
about falling asleep, Jake.

85
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,979
Don't give it a thought, Robert.

86
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,980
I'll see ya.

87
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,284
Asseyez-vous.

88
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,524
Merci. Vous êtes très gentil.

89
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,260
- What would you like to drink?
- Pernod.

90
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,529
Well, that's not good for little girls.

91
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,197
"Little girl" yourself!.

92
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,468
Garçon? Un Pernod.

93
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,476
Oui, madame.

94
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,659
Merci.

95
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,475
- Ca va?
- Oui. Ca va.

96
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,242
- You are American.
- Yes.

97
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,318
I hope you don't mind.

98
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,615
No. I've got nothing against Americans.

99
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,485
- You going on a party?
- I don't know.

100
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,857
You never know in this lousy town.

101
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,862
You don't like Paris?

102
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,932
No!

103
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,024
Why don’t you go somewhere else?

104
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:59,935
- There isn't anywhere else.
- You're in a fine mood.

105
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,939
Mmm.

106
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,746
I like your dress.

107
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,748
Do you?

108
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,784
I don't like your hat.

109
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:18,156
Well, I still like your dress.

110
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,316
I buy a different one every day.

111
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:25,728
How would you like to buy me dinner?

112
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,800
- Why not?
- Where shall we go?

113
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,994
Anywhere. I don't care.

114
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,571
Do you know, uh, Pharamond?

115
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,836
- No. No. Pharamond? No.
- The food's good.

116
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:40,310
Well, this is something.

117
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,313
Let's get a taxi.

118
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,853
Are we going to eat in there?

119
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:27,654
Well, maybe you’d like to keep the cab
and go on to Maxim's, hmm?

120
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,220
Well, as long, as you say,
the food is good.

121
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:50,211
- Hi, Jake.
- Hello, Jake. You're coming to the dancing, aren’t you?

122
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,547
- Dancing?
- Yes, you must come. We're all going.

123
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,883
It's at the Rue Sainte Geneviève.

124
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,751
Yes. Sure.

125
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,722
Of course he's coming.

126
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,953
- And bring your friend.
- Yes, I will.

127
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,524
I don't want to sit there.

128
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,602
I want to sit over there...

129
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,671
where I can see.

130
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,841
- Who is that Jake’s got with him?
- I don't know.

131
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,409
- Who are your friends?
- Oh, some writers and artists.

132
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,716
Oh, there are a lot of them
on this side of the river.

133
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,655
- Too many.
- I think so.

134
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:38,627
Still, some of them make money.

135
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:42,394
I suppose so. Anyway, it's cheaper
to live here than in New York.

136
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:46,267
- Louis?
- Oui, monsieur?

137
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,116
Taxi!

138
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,288
Well, you were right.

139
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,348
The food was good.
I didn't like the coffee.

140
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,496
All right.
I'll admit it could be better.

141
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,794
- Where do we go now?
- That's up to you.

142
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,596
What about that dancing
at the balmusette?

143
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:23,031
What's the matter?
Don’t you like me?

144
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,908
- I like you fine.
- Well, what's the matter? What's wrong?

145
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,549
I was hurt in the war.

146
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,819
I'm sorry.

147
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,186
- By the way, what's your name?
- Georgette.

148
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,260
- And yours?
- Jacob.

149
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,897
I'm sorry you were wounded.

150
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:49,627
Oh, it doesn't matter.
It happened a long time ago.

151
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,306
I like you, Jacob. You're a nice man.

152
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,603
Do you really have to wear that hat?

153
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,383
Au balmusette.

154
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,625
What do you want out of me?
For heaven's sakes.

155
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,727
Besides, it was your idea, you know.

156
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,735
- Let's dance.
- All right. Come on.

157
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,368
- Oui.

158
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,922
Robert, I'd like to check my hat.

159
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,150
All right. Go on and check it.

160
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,107
What a box to sweat in.

161
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,406
- It's hot, all right.
- Bonsoir, madame. Bonsoir, monsieur.

162
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:46,779
Would you like to check that?
Let's go to the bar and have a beer.

163
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,753
Jake! Jake. We're over here.

164
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,466
Mrs. Braddocks,
Mr. Braddocks, Mr. Cohn.

165
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:05,025
May I present my fiancée,
Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc.

166
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,334
Oh, really? Are you related
to Georgette Leblanc, the singer?

167
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,137
- But you have the same name.

168
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,144
No, my name is Hobin.

169
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:19,614
But surely Mr. Barnes introduced you
as Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc.

170
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:23,051
- He's a fool.
- Oh, it was a joke then?

171
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,248
Yes, to laugh at.

172
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,793
Who is she?
Do I have to talk to her?

173
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,886
You don't have to talk to anyone.
Come on. Let's get that drink.

174
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,988
- Jake, what'll you have? I'll get it.
- Just a beer.

175
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,999
- Excuse me.
- Mademoiselle?

176
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,035
- Nothing.
- Would you like to dance?

177
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,037
Yes. Why not?

178
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,107
If you’ll excuse me.

179
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,410
Who is she, Jake?

180
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,645
I don't know.

181
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,215
- Hello, Jake.
- Hello, Frances. How are you?

182
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,616
Fine, thanks.
Robert, let's sit down now.

183
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,087
- No, I want to talk to Jake for a minute.
- I think I'll go home.

184
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,317
All right.

185
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,732
- No improvement since this morning?
- No. There's no solution.

186
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,631
It's over, Jake. Finished.

187
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:14,103
What about South America?
Have you thought any more about it?

188
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,766
Sure, I've thought about it,
but I still don’t want to go.

189
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,275
- But why?
- I told you why.

190
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:23,109
Anyway, going to another country
isn't gonna help.

191
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,945
- It might help me.
- I doubt it.

192
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:28,349
Told you, too,
that I'm going to Spain.

193
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,548
I'm gonna do some fishing and see
some bullfights.

194
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,836
Hey, Jake. Who's that?

195
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:55,006
- Good evening.

196
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,344
- Hello, Brett. Good you're back.
- Hello. How are you?

197
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:00,384
I think that's the most beautiful woman
I've seen in years.

198
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,080
- Ah, bonsoir.

199
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,156
Who is she, Jake?

200
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,154
Her name's Brett Ashley.

201
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,229
Why haven't I seen her before?

202
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,198
I guess she's been away.

203
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,098
Oh, Brett! Brett. Brett, my dear!

204
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,798
- Hello, Zizi.
- Oh! I've got something fine to tell you.

205
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,341
And I want you to meet a friend of mine.

206
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,810
Lady Ashley, I'd like to present
Count Mippipopolous.

207
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,813
How do you do?

208
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,786
- Does Your Ladyship enjoy your stay in Paris?
- Oh, yes. Fine.

209
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,420
Well, Paris is all right as a town...

210
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,925
but I understand there is
big doings over in London.

211
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,927
Yes. Huge.

212
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:47,726
Hmm. Does Your Ladyship care to dance?

213
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,131
A little later. Thank you.

214
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,035
Hello, Jake.

215
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:57,233
Hello, Brett.
I didn't know you were back.

216
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,970
- Yes, I just got back.
- Oh.

217
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,547
Oh, excuse me.
Lady Brett Ashley, Mr. Robert Cohn.

218
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,548
How do you do?

219
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,982
He thinks you're the most
beautiful woman he's ever seen.

220
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,714
Oh! That's very nice to hear,
but I'm sure you’re not serious.

221
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,790
I assure you I am.

222
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,690
- That's a fine crowd you're with, Brett.
- Yes. Aren't they lovely?

223
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:19,161
And you, darling-
Are you having a lovely evening?

224
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,233
- Priceless.
- Would you care to dance, Lady Brett?

225
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:25,201
Sorry, but I promised this one to Jacob.

226
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:28,273
Jacob, you have a terribly biblical name.

227
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:31,001
I didn't pick it
or perhaps I'd have done better.

228
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,044
Well, what about the next one?

229
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,443
We'll see. I never make plans. Zizi.

230
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,674
- Yes. Yes, dear?
- Would you take this for me?

231
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,751
Anything.

232
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:50,087
- You've made a new conquest there.
- Have I? That's nice.

233
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:56,296
- I suppose you like to add them up, hmm?
- Oh, stop it, Jake.

234
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,738
- Howdy, Lady Brett!
- Hi, Herbie. How are you?

235
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,868
You just get back?

236
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,176
- Mm-hmm.
- It's good to see you.

237
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,182
Thank you.

238
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,692
What's the matter?

239
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:35,261
- You were gay a minute ago.
- Yes, I know.

240
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,342
But it's all gone now.

241
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,212
Darling, I love you.

242
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,282
I can't help myself.

243
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,385
I know it's no good.

244
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,918
Let's get out of here.
You don't mind, do you?

245
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,925
Come on.

246
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,263
Jake? Jake!
You're not going, are you?

247
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,340
- I'd like to get some air.
- At least let me buy you a drink.

248
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,909
- No, the bar's too crowded.
- I'll get it. What are you having?

249
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,910
- Ah, Pernod.
- You, Jake?

250
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:17,038
Just another beer, please.

251
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,846
- Now, was that really necessary?
- I didn't want to argue.

252
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,022
- Oh, Brett.
- Thank you.

253
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,290
- Zizi?
- Yes?

254
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,228
Zizi, I came
with that girl in the green.

255
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,232
Uh-

256
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,866
- The one with the feather on?
- That's right.

257
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,932
- If she asks for me, give her this, will you?
- But will she understand?

258
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:49,412
I think so.
Just tell her it's taxi fare home.

259
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,482
She must live in Marseille.

260
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:57,018
Hey, Zizi.

261
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,896
Le Select, s'il vous plait.

262
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,228
- Merci bien, monsieur. Ca va.
- Ca va.

263
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,903
Taxi? A taxi?

264
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,907
No. Here.

265
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:29,485
Oh, darling, I've been so miserable.

266
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,954
It rained every day in Vienna.

267
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,992
And the Danube's brown.
It's not blue.

268
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,288
And I missed you. I missed you.

269
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,191
It didn't work out.

270
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,863
Being away from you
is worse than being here.

271
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,566
It wasn't exactly easy for me.

272
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,109
I suppose not.

273
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,077
Funny thing,
but the first week I was all right.

274
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,445
I didn't have a drink - not one.

275
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,178
And then I ran into some people
we knew during the war...

276
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,254
and it all started all over again.

277
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:09,091
Nothing ever really changes, does it?

278
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,294
I know I shouldn't have come back.

279
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:19,393
But I couldn't stay away either.

280
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,098
We can't go through
all that hell again.

281
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,505
No.

282
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:27,510
I had to see you. You understand?

283
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:33,411
You said to me that one day
I'd come to hate you.

284
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,486
I wish I did.

285
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,684
I'm going to marry Michael, Jake,
and go away with him.

286
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,089
It's the only thing to do.

287
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,195
Have you heard from him?

288
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,699
Almost every day. He's in Scotland.

289
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,263
Well, he's a nice guy.

290
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:59,135
What about you, Jake?
Are you all right?

291
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:02,145
Yes. I could be worse off.
I could be dead.

292
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,011
Don't we pay for the things
we do though?

293
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,817
When I think of all the hell
I put other people through.

294
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,754
I'm paying for it all now.

295
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,830
Don't be silly.

296
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,760
Would you mind
if I ask you to do something?

297
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,995
Of course not.

298
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:28,561
Will you kiss me just once more
before we get there?

299
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,653
- Merci, monsieur.

300
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:00,004
Let's go inside.

301
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,785
Let's take this one.

302
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,058
Bonsoir, monsieur, madame.

303
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:28,226
- Feel better?
- A little.

304
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,428
Who's Robert Cohn, Jake?

305
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,664
A writer. Why?

306
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,741
Just interested in your friends.

307
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:40,471
- He's my tennis friend.
- He doesn't look the athletic type.

308
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,547
Well, that shows how wrong you can be.

309
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,115
He was middleweight
boxing champion at Princeton.

310
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:48,414
Really? Well, he certainly
doesn't look very pugnacious.

311
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,489
He learned to box in order
to survive in the Ivy League.

312
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,616
I don't think he's ever hit anyone
in his life outside a gym.

313
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:57,991
You did say Pernod,
didn’t you, Lady Brett?

314
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:01,190
I certainly did.
It's very nice of you to remember.

315
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,598
- It wasn't very long ago.
- Sit down, Robert.

316
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,939
- Why did you leave the dancing?
- The same reason you did.

317
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:15,604
It was too hot.
Everybody's coming over here.

318
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:20,174
- Who's everybody?
- Well, the count, Zizi, the Braddocks.

319
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:23,413
That girl you brought
got into a terrible row after you left.

320
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,491
She has a wonderful command
of the idiom.

321
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:29,116
- What happened then?
- I don't know. I came here.

322
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:32,253
- Here they are.

323
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,593
Ah! Zizi.

324
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,728
- Well, I'm going home.
- Oh, no. Don't go. It's early.

325
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,739
It's not that early.

326
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,274
Lady Brett, I wondered
what had happened to you.

327
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,908
My dear sir,
you have spirited the lady away...

328
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,987
but I cannot say I blame you.

329
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:59,545
- Well, I didn't spirit her far enough, it seems.
- Absolutely right.

330
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:02,183
Lady Brett,
I know you love dancing.

331
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:05,263
Therefore,
I brought with me the musicians.

332
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:07,263
Ah, Zizi.

333
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:10,163
Will I see you tomorrow?

334
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:13,499
- Sure.
- Call me around 5:00.

335
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,505
All right.

336
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:19,475
Well, my dear sir, you sure you wouldn't
stay with us and have a glass of wine?

337
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,546
Thank you,
but I have to work in the morning.

338
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:25,104
- Good night, Robert. Good night, Brett.
- I'm sorry. Very sorry.

339
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,886
You leaving again?

340
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:31,956
- Yes. I'm a working man.
- I am a working girl.

341
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:35,720
- Well, I guess we keep different hours.
- Probablement. Bonsoir.

342
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:38,295
- Bonsoir. Good night, Peter.
- Good night, Jake.

343
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:40,364
- Good night.
- Good night.

344
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,201
What's the matter, Jake?

345
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:50,103
Oh, nothing.

346
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,836
The whole show makes me sick,
that's all.

347
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,912
- Yes, I know.

348
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,970
Come on, Lady!

349
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:32,707
Say, what do you know
about Lady Brett Ashley, Jake?

350
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,911
Well, her name's Ashley.
Brett's her own name.

351
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,819
She's an American.
Married an Englishman during the war.

352
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,891
He was killed in Flanders.

353
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,085
- Have you known her a long time?
- Sure.

354
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:47,324
She was a V.A.D. in a hospital I was in
in Italy during the war.

355
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:52,369
She's very attractive.
There's a quality about her, a certain style.

356
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,370
She's very nice.

357
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:57,669
She seems to be
absolutely fine and straight.

358
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,301
You sound as if you were
pretty interested.

359
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,312
I am.

360
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,644
Well, then let me give you the facts.

361
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,649
She's a drunk and a drifter.

362
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,878
She's gonna marry
a guy named Mike Campbell.

363
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,979
- That way she'll have a rich but sodden old age.
- I don't believe it.

364
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,558
Don't ask a lot of fool questions
if you don't like the answers.

365
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,957
I didn't ask you for a rundown
on her private life.

366
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,462
- You asked me what I knew about her.
- I didn't ask you to insult her.

367
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,464
- Oh, go to hell.
- Take that back.

368
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,763
- Cut out the prep school stuff, Robert.
- Take it back!

369
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,838
Sure, sure. I never heard
of Brett Ashley. How's that?

370
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,840
No, not that.
About me going to hell.

371
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:34,503
Don't go to hell. Go back in the Select,
if that’s what you want.

372
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:37,240
All right. I will!

373
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,445
It's all right. I'm with you.

374
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:34,094
- Where are you taking me?
- Back into the sun.

375
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,100
Doctor's orders.

376
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:09,500
Well, I know this may sound ungrateful,
but whatever made you become a nurse?

377
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,796
You're not exactly the type.

378
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,804
Oh, I don't know.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

379
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:17,704
The only person
I really cared about was gone.

380
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,709
He was killed in 1916.

381
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,904
Your husband?

382
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,538
What a rotten time everybody's had.

383
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:27,049
- I know, but it's almost over now.
- So they say.

384
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,517
Where will you go?

385
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,589
I don't know. Paris.

386
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,850
I was there once on leave.
I liked it.

387
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,188
- I might see you there.
- Yes?

388
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:40,526
There's no point in going back to England.
Maybe Paris is the answer.

389
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:43,260
- Well, I- I have to run now.
- So soon?

390
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,836
You're not the only patient
in the hospital, you know.

391
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,633
No? I thought I was.

392
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,538
- See you later.
- Good-bye.

393
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,293
- Morning, Barnes.
- Good morning, Doctor.

394
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:15,331
How's everything
in the sick and sorry paddock?

395
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,266
Oh, the usual ailments.

396
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:22,029
How's the hand?

397
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,940
Oh, it's all right.
Just a little clumsy.

398
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,911
I think we can take
the bandages off in a day or two.

399
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:31,447
Then you can start the exercises.

400
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,177
You should be out of here in a month.

401
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,776
Back to the squadron?

402
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,856
No, I'm afraid not.

403
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,720
Doctor, don’t you think it's about time
you stopped lying to me?

404
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,067
What do you want to know, Barnes?

405
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,215
Am I going to be all right?

406
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,650
There'll be certain aftereffects
from your wound...

407
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,722
but that's to be expected.

408
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:15,190
The important thing is that the shell
fragment that entered your back...

409
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,193
missed your spine...

410
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:20,355
so you’ll be able to walk and move about
absolutely normally.

411
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,693
However-

412
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,964
Go on.

413
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,404
You're going to be impotent.

414
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,649
Impotent?

415
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:50,451
I'm sorry, but you asked me
for the truth.

416
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,131
Sure.

417
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,133
Cigarette?

418
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,678
Is it all right if I smoke?

419
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,684
Of course.

420
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,467
Well, thanks for being honest
with me anyway.

421
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,578
Jake!

422
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,106
Jake?

423
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,127
Jake!

424
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,906
- Jake?

425
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,837
- Jake!

426
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,222
Jake!

427
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,468
Jake. Jake!

428
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:44,302
Madame Blanche.

429
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,604
I was only coming up to see you, Jake...

430
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:52,012
but this woman's making a terrible row.

431
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:15,204
What a silly thing to do.
Start a row like that.

432
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,277
You weren't asleep, were you?

433
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,413
What did you think I was doing?

434
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,641
I don't know. What time is it?

435
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,741
Well, it's almost 4:30.

436
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,412
Oh, I'm sorry.

437
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,489
Do you mind if I sit down?

438
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,256
Don't be cross, darling.

439
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,957
- I'm not cross.
- Oh! I look a mess.

440
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:44,034
Can I have a drink?

441
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:58,315
Oh, just a little one.
Don't try and make me drunk.

442
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,325
Who did you come with?

443
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,326
Hmm?

444
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:14,592
- Who brought you here?
- Oh! Oh, the count.

445
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,826
You know, he's quite nice really.

446
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:22,731
Is he? Where did you go with him?

447
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,740
Ooh, everywhere.

448
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,810
He's waiting downstairs for me now.

449
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,210
Very devoted of him, don’t you think?

450
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:34,273
You know, he offered me $10,000
to go to Biarritz with him.

451
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:36,353
I told him I couldn't do it.

452
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,752
Told him I know
too many people in Biarritz.

453
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,790
So he said, "What about Cannes?"

454
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,359
Told him I know
too many people in Cannes.

455
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,952
Told him I know
too many people everywhere.

456
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:50,159
- He was very nice about it.
- I'm glad.

457
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:53,470
Don't look like that.

458
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:58,405
I told him I was in love with you.

459
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,841
It's true.

460
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,311
He was very nice about that too.

461
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,575
Said in that case, we'd just be friends.

462
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,651
That's why he's waiting downstairs now.

463
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,312
He wants to take us to breakfast
in the Bois.

464
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,722
You know why I really came here?

465
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,454
Why?

466
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,597
Because I wanted to see you.

467
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,637
Isn't that silly?

468
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:30,468
Wake a man up just for that.

469
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,648
- Brett?
- Yes?

470
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,742
Is this all part of a personal cure?

471
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:46,018
There is no cure. You know that.

472
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:51,259
There's your admirer now.

473
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,396
Come in. Come in.

474
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:58,298
Mr. Barnes, I hope that the fact
of our intrusion will be forgiven...

475
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:01,337
just as soon as you will taste
some of this delicious wine.

476
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,407
Oh, please don't apologize, Count.

477
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,475
I'm sure Jake doesn't mind at all.

478
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:08,340
No, I don't mind,
as long as you didn't bring your band.

479
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,414
I wanted to, but they wouldn’t come.

480
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,483
Zizi, put this thing
on the table over there.

481
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,989
- Ah, open the bottle.
- It's not cold enough yet.

482
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,685
It will chill much quicker once it opens.

483
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:34,694
And now, if you don't mind,
I'll join you in the car a little bit later.

484
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:37,433
Just as you say, Your Highness.

485
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:45,673
- Is Zizi on your payroll, Count?
- Not officially.

486
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:48,251
I just allow him to, uh-

487
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:50,820
to steal from me from time to time.

488
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,389
Of course, I know we are
not given much chance...

489
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:56,790
to enjoy really good wine
in the States now...

490
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,829
but this one I got from my friend,
who is in the business.

491
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,194
Oh, you always know
somebody in the trade.

492
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:04,767
Well, this particular fellow
raises the grapes.

493
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,837
He's got thousands of acres of them.

494
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,064
Oh, what's his name? Veuve Clicquot?

495
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:12,404
No. Mum. He's a baron.

496
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,974
Couldn't we have
some of this wine now?

497
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:21,245
I'd like to drink a toast
to a man I know in Scotland.

498
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,252
A very nice guy.

499
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:26,152
Well, this wine is much too good
for the toast drinking.

500
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:30,318
You should never mix up emotions
with a wine like this, my dear.

501
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,726
You lose the taste.

502
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,697
You ought to write
a book on wines, Count.

503
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,930
Mr. Barnes, all I want
out of wine is to enjoy it.

504
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:43,006
- Well, let's enjoy some now.
- Well, there you are, my dear.

505
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,735
Enjoy it, but very slowly.

506
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:48,607
- Later you can get drunk.
- Drunk? Listen to the man.

507
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:51,180
Oh, you're very charming
when you get drunk.

508
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,080
I am not. I talk too much.

509
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,813
I've just talked myself
all out here to Jake.

510
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:59,116
You know, Lady Brett?

511
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:02,317
I really would like to hear you talk...

512
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:05,327
because when you talk to me,
you never finish your sentences.

513
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,397
Leave it for you to finish.

514
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,797
Leave it for anyone to finish
the way they please.

515
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:21,543
You know,
you both are very nice people.

516
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,546
Why don't you get married, you two?

517
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:31,753
We want to lead our own lives.

518
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,347
Yes, we have our careers.

519
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:41,923
Come on, Count.
Let's get out of here.

520
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,364
- Would you like to join us, Jake?
- No.

521
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,266
All right.

522
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:54,344
Oh, just a minute, Count.

523
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,413
You forgot your champagne.

524
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,778
I did not forget, my dear sir.

525
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,783
Good night.

526
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,864
I forgot my things.

527
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,737
Oh, Jake.

528
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,297
Oh, Jake. Jake.

529
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:32,404
Well, you're killing him.

530
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:35,137
Hello, Jake.

531
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:38,874
Oh, Robert,
I'm sorry about last night.

532
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:41,747
- Don't be silly. It was all my fault.

533
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,285
Are you busy for lunch?

534
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:49,155
Yes. I've got to see my mother's lawyer.

535
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:52,888
He's only gonna be in town
for a couple of days.

536
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:55,090
I wanted to talk to you.

537
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,724
Anything the matter, Jake?

538
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,803
No, no. It can wait.

539
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:05,706
You know, I really think you’re wrong
about Brett Ashley.

540
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:09,802
- I think if she ever found the right guy-
- Uh-huh.

541
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:14,049
No, I'm serious.

542
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,381
Well, that's good.

543
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,055
You going somewhere?

544
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:23,058
Yes. I made up my mind today.

545
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:27,390
- With Frances?
- No.

546
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,966
No, I don't think so.

547
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,428
I'm sick of Paris, Jake.

548
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:37,063
A change never hurt anybody.

549
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:41,133
You were wide open, kid.

550
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:45,944
Looks like you plan to be gone for some time.
You going to South America?

551
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,450
No, no, no, no.

552
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:50,816
Oh!

553
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:55,892
- Whoo-hoo!
- You know, you're in an awful good mood.

554
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:58,427
Something must have happened.

555
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,521
I'm not so sure I don't like you better
when you're unhappy.

556
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,668
Oh, Mr. Barnes.
Mr. Jackson telephoned.

557
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:15,370
They're using your Pershing story
on Saturday.

558
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:18,004
He asked me to tell you
that he was very pleased with it.

559
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,583
- Fine. Has he read it?
- Of course.

560
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:22,584
Well, one never knows.

561
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:26,452
- And get Lady Ashley on the phone for me, please.
- Yes, sir.

562
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,889
Jake!

563
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:33,053
Jake!

564
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:36,155
Jake!

565
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:38,166
I'm here!

566
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,168
I'm late, but I'm here!

567
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,397
Hello, Bill. Welcome to Paris.

568
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,406
Oh!

569
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,476
I've been traveling!

570
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,910
Jake, I've met every bartender
from Copenhagen to Vienna.

571
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:51,981
And, Jake, they're wonderful people.

572
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,550
- All of them- wonderful people!

573
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:57,119
Mr. Barnes,
I spoke with Lady Ashley's maid.

574
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:59,621
It seems she's gone out of town.

575
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:02,089
- Out of town?
- Yes, sir.

576
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:04,160
Well, thank you, Mrs. Lloyd.

577
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,560
Hey, Jake! Come on!
Come on! The fish are bitin'.

578
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:11,760
I can see that from here. Don’t you think
you ought to introduce me to your friend?

579
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:15,171
- What's your name?
- Name, name.

580
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,172
- Your name.
- Ah!

581
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,539
Je m'appelle
Marie Genevieve Bidegaray.

582
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,542
I'll introduce you later.

583
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:27,116
I'll be right down and help you.

584
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,048
Oh, you!

585
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,554
- Good night! So long!
- Bonsoir!

586
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:41,529
See you around! Good-bye!

587
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,226
- Whoa! What's all this? Hey, what's this?

588
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:47,303
Uh? Oh!

589
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,203
What'd she say?

590
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,607
- She says they're goats.
- Hmm?

591
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:58,010
That's just what I need. There's nothing
like goat's milk to prevent a hangover.

592
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:01,312
No, no, no, no. You can't drink that.
It's not pasteurized.

593
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:04,216
There's nothing that goat can give me
that I can't give her.

594
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,221
- Just give me-
- Now, come on.

595
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,791
- Huh?

596
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:11,690
- What'd she say?
- J'ai faim.

597
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:14,696
- She's hungry.
- Oh! Well, don't worry.

598
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:17,995
We'll see that you’re well fed.
Well fed!

599
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:21,400
- Mmm.
- Huh?

600
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,372
- Oh. What'd she say?

601
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,442
- J'ai froid.
- She's cold.

602
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:28,443
- Oh!
- Do you have a jacket?

603
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:30,911
- Do you have a jacket?
- Eh? Ah, oui!

604
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,914
Voilà!

605
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,520
- Well, that oughta keep you nice and warm.
- Yeah.

606
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:40,249
- Merci.

607
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,326
- Come on. Let's go.
- Yeah. Come on.

608
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:01,144
Ah, isn't this wonderful?

609
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:05,581
I sure love this burg.

610
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:08,480
Yes, but they're cutting a new street
through right down there.

611
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:10,485
- See?
- Hmm?

612
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:12,555
Look, I'll show you.

613
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:22,657
See, that's where I mean.

614
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:25,894
Ah, they would.
They're doing it everywhere.

615
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:29,530
- Except Spain.
- Yeah. Except Spain.

616
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,234
- They'll get there.
- We'll get there first, old man.

617
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,310
We'll get there first.

618
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:03,840
Here you are. These are yours.

619
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:14,477
Oh, workin' for the common good, huh?
That's what I like to see.

620
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:19,987
- Any more coffee?
- Sure. Plenty. Help yourself.

621
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,285
- Might as well drink it all.
- I will.

622
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:26,351
Coffee's good for ya.
It's the caffeine in it.

623
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:30,593
Ooh! Caffeine, we are here.

624
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:34,831
Caffeine puts a man on her horse
and a woman in his grave.

625
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:38,396
Say, didn't that friend of yours in Paris
who had all those pictures...

626
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:40,476
say that we were the lost generation?

627
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:43,171
Yes, she was a great talker,
but I liked her pictures better.

628
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:49,583
Whatever became of that girl
who used to hang around in Paris?

629
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:52,177
Oh, what was her name? Brett.

630
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,328
What about her?

631
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,994
Were you in love with her?

632
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:07,002
Yeah.

633
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:09,004
Very long?

634
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:12,007
Yes, off and on for a long time.

635
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:16,068
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. It's all over now.

636
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:23,109
- You're not sore I asked, are you?
- No, no.

637
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,152
When are we going to the fiesta?

638
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,889
- I want to see the bullfights.
- Day after tomorrow.

639
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:36,966
You want to get any fishing in,
you better get started.

640
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,960
Hey!

641
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,037
- Hola, Jake!
- Ah!

642
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:35,146
Oh, this is Bill Gorton.
Juanito Montoya. He owns this joint.

643
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:37,345
- Pleased to meet you.
- As am I, senor.

644
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:39,820
- Your friends are here, you know.
- My friends?

645
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:42,221
Yes. They're waiting for you
at the Cafe Iruna.

646
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,816
You do not have to register now.
Later.

647
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,725
Go and find your friends and take them
to the unloading of the bulls.

648
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,823
- I will see you there.
- Bien, Juanito. Bill.

649
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:02,569
Who's he referring to?
Your friends.

650
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,579
I wonder.

651
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:14,112
- Isn't that Brett?
- Yeah.

652
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:20,425
Who's the guy with her?

653
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,624
Mike Campbell,
the fellow she's going to marry.

654
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:29,204
Jake!

655
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,777
- Brett.
- Jake, darling.

656
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,779
- Hello, Bill.
- Jake, how are you?

657
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,076
- Where have you chaps been?
- Bill, this is Mike Campbell.

658
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:42,413
- How do you do, sir?
- Bill Gorton. Glad to meet you.

659
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,714
- Bill, where did you come from?
- Budapest.

660
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:46,721
- Byway of Paris.
- How was it?

661
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:49,291
Oh, wonderful. Just wonderful.
So was Prague.

662
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:52,657
- Ask him about Berlin. Here you are, Bill.
- Oh, thank you.

663
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:54,730
Actually, Berlin was not so good...

664
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:57,061
although it seemed better than it was.

665
00:53:57,167 --> 00:54:00,500
- How do you mean?
- Oh, it was tight all the time. Just tight.

666
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:03,596
- That's something new. But have a drink.
- Thank you.

667
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:07,541
- Did you have good fishing, Jake?
- Yes, it was fine.

668
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:09,544
Brett, that's what
we should have done-

669
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:11,546
joined 'em up in the mountains.

670
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:14,617
We'd never have gotten here in time
for the fiesta if we’d tried to go fishing.

671
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,447
Robert, where did you come from?

672
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:21,422
San Sebastian. I arrived last night
with Brett and Mike.

673
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:24,152
- My name is Robert Cohn.
- Bill Gorton. My pleasure.

674
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,889
- How are you?
- Fishing. Haven't been fishing since the war.

675
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:30,933
- Tried to go often enough.
- Oh? Were you in the army?

676
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:34,333
Yes. Indeed I was.

677
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:38,139
And what times we had.

678
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:40,573
How I only wish
those dear old days were back.

679
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:43,237
Oh, don't be such an idiot, Michael.

680
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:46,144
Actually, he was
a very distinguished soldier.

681
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:48,740
Tell them about the time your horse
bolted down Piccadilly.

682
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:51,582
I certainly will do nothing of the kind.
It reflects discredit on me.

683
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:53,588
Well, then tell them about your medals.

684
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:57,751
That's even a worse story. Brett only
likes stories that reflect discredit on me.

685
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:00,386
- Not very good for a bankrupt.
- Bankrupt?

686
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:02,863
- Mm-hmm.
- How'd that happen to you?

687
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,264
Two ways-
gradually and suddenly.

688
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:08,303
However, don’t you think
it's a rather gloomy subject?

689
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:12,364
Yes, it certainly is. What do you say
we go down and see the bulls unloaded?

690
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:15,342
Oh, it's a splendid idea.
Come along, Jake.

691
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:18,471
Be right with you.
I have to settle this.

692
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:21,015
Huh. You know-
No, no, no. Please.

693
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:23,210
Don’t you think
it's rather odd for a bankrupt?

694
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,050
I always seem to wind up
with the check. Hmm.

695
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:29,324
Coming?

696
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,899
What are you doing here?

697
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,902
I came to see the bullfights.
I've never seen one before.

698
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,904
Did you know
I was gonna be here?

699
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:46,066
- Of course I did. Robert told me.
- Where did you pick him up?

700
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,145
That's who I went
to San Sebastian with.

701
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:52,112
- Congratulations.
- What did you say that for?

702
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:54,115
Well, what did you want me to say?

703
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,947
I thought it might be good for him.
Good for me too.

704
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:59,044
Oh, you oughta take up social work.

705
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:02,454
Darling, don't be mean.
Anyway, it didn't work out. Not for me.

706
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,027
And then Michael came.

707
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:08,689
Michael and I are going to get married,
as soon as he straightens his finances out.

708
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:11,665
Perhaps you'd like me to help you
arrange a short-term loan.

709
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:13,861
- That's not very funny.
- Isn't it?

710
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,545
By the way, how does Michael
feel about Robert?

711
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:31,085
Oh, they seem to get along all right.

712
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:34,679
You've got everything arranged
very well, haven't you?

713
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:37,487
Darling, please don't-
don't be like that.

714
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:40,154
I'm not. I'm just... detached.

715
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:45,527
Well, are we going to see
these ferocious bulls or are we not?

716
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:48,365
- Sure. Come on. We were just waiting for you.
- Bill.

717
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,341
I think we can get in up here.

718
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:29,207
Yes, you go on. Um, senora?

719
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:31,542
Por favor.

720
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,548
Gracias.

721
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:36,312
Senor. Gracias.

722
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,830
Are those the bulls?

723
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:51,366
Shh. Not so loud.
No, those are the steers.

724
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:55,734
- Steers?
- Yes. They receive the bulls and keep them from fighting.

725
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,239
But don't the bulls ever gore the steers?

726
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:01,071
Sometimes. Sometimes they go
right after them and kill them.

727
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:03,168
Can't the steers
do anything about it?

728
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:05,509
No, they're too busy
trying to make friends.

729
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:08,083
That must be swell- being a steer.

730
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,749
Toro! Toro!

731
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:25,190
Toro! Toro! Toro!

732
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:27,496
Aqui! Aqui! Toro!

733
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:30,573
- Oh, he's beautiful.
- Yes.

734
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,767
- Toro!

735
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:35,845
Watch the way he uses his horns.

736
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:38,277
He's got a left and a right,
just like a boxer.

737
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:41,214
Aqui, toro! Toro!

738
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,228
How many bulls are there?

739
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:55,195
Well, there's six for the first fight
and maybe one to spare.

740
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:01,767
Watch this one. He'll quiet down
as soon as he sees the others.

741
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:04,203
Toro! Toro!

742
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,853
- Has anyone a light?
- Mmm.

743
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:22,390
Thank you.

744
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,463
Aqui, toro! Aqui!. Toro, toro!

745
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,970
Toro, aqui!

746
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,575
Watch this one.
He's a wonderful bull.

747
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:46,171
Toro! Toro!

748
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:49,149
Aqui, toro!

749
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:53,749
Toro! Toro!

750
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:03,864
Toro! Toro, aqui!

751
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:12,107
Toro! Toro!

752
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,335
Aqui! Aqui!

753
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:17,811
- Toro, aqui!

754
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:20,439
- I don't like the looks of this one.

755
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,041
- Hmm?
- Watch how he digs with his left horn.

756
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:27,484
- Hmm?
- Mmm.

757
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:29,490
Toro!

758
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:37,556
That's certainly no life being a steer.

759
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:42,735
Oh, you don't think so?

760
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:45,899
I should have thought you’d
have loved being a steer, Robert.

761
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,273
What do you mean, Mike?

762
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:51,438
Well, they lead
such a sort of quiet life.

763
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:53,606
They never say anything important...

764
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:55,616
and they're always hanging around.

765
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:58,949
I should have thought
you'd have enjoyed that.

766
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:01,250
Aren’t you going to say anything?

767
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:03,382
Oh, shut up, Mike.

768
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,586
Toro! Toro!

769
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:17,438
Cohn, don't you know
when you're not wanted?

770
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:20,236
I know when I'm not wanted.

771
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:23,368
You're drunk.

772
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:26,448
I am not drunk.
I am not drunk at all.

773
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:28,915
- Shall we go? I think the show is over.
- Yes.

774
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,145
Robert, come on.

775
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:36,484
- Well, that was pleasant.
- Wasn't it?

776
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:39,891
Michael, I do wish
you'd try and behave.

777
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:41,896
My dear, I am behaving.

778
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:45,627
I'm just sick and tired of him
hanging around. That's all.

779
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:48,636
You know-You know, Jake...

780
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:51,468
it's not that I'm jealous
or anything like that.

781
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:54,566
I can't help it if he’s in love
with Brett.

782
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:57,578
But I do think he could behave like a man.
Don’t you?

783
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,080
- Well, he's trying.
- Is he?

784
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:02,617
Well, I'm not impressed.

785
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:06,052
Jake, do you know
what he calls Brett?

786
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:08,953
Circe the temptress.

787
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,720
He claims she turns men into swine.

788
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:14,456
I read it in a letter he left for her.
Pretty good, eh?

789
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,226
Look, Mike, I don't care
what he wrote in a letter to her.

790
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:19,893
But let's just not spoil
the whole fiesta, shall we?

791
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:23,563
Mike, darling, will you please
try not to make such a fuss?

792
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:25,800
I shall do my best, my dear.

793
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:28,741
I can't promise much,
but I shall do my best.

794
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:32,975
Oh, uh, may I offer
Your Ladyship a light?

795
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,141
Oh, come on, Mike.

796
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:48,062
Her Ladyship.

797
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:51,861
- Buenos dias.
- Buenos dias.

798
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:55,028
- Oh, what time is it?
- Well, it's just 6:30.

799
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:58,471
Ooh, what an uncivilized hour to get up!

800
01:02:58,574 --> 01:03:02,908
Couldn't they do this thing
at a little later time?

801
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:06,675
You should've stayed out all night,
dear girl, like we did.

802
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:33,868
Jake, just what is
the encierro anyway?

803
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:37,104
Well, it's the running of the bulls
from the corral up to the ring.

804
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:40,614
Anyway, it gives the young men of the town
a chance to show their bravery.

805
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:42,843
Sounds like a fine custom.

806
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:44,920
Oh, Mike? Mike?

807
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:46,921
Now, where did Mike and Bill go?

808
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:49,924
Well, they probably wanted to watch
the bulls run through the streets.

809
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:53,655
Let's us go and get seated for the finish.
That's the best part.

810
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:08,528
Coming through here.

811
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:13,098
Thank you very much.

812
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,588
I say, give me some.

813
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:40,501
Hey! Toros!

814
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:47,709
Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on!

815
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:48,400
- I'm out of wind!
- Olé!

816
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:51,871
Congratulations, old boy.

817
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:00,415
Time for refreshment.

818
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:13,388
- What happens now?
- They let in a vaca brava- a cow.

819
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:15,464
It gives the amateur bullfighters
a chance.

820
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:18,226
- Will the cow charge?
- Wait and see.

821
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,780
- I say, Bill?
- Huh?

822
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:11,410
Do you suppose
she might find her way over here?

823
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,420
Oh, it seems unlikely.

824
01:08:13,522 --> 01:08:17,856
- Oh, look. There's Bill.

825
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,928
Yes, that's Mike with him.

826
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:24,163
- Toro!

827
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:27,724
Toro! Old boy!

828
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:30,965
- What's that?
- It's a personal check of mine, old boy.

829
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:32,973
It's bounced three times.

830
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:35,976
I was wondering if it could possibly
have an effect on that animal.

831
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:38,478
- Why don’t you try it on him?
- I shall.

832
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:41,709
What's that he's got in his hand?

833
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:44,183
That looks like a check.

834
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:47,380
Oh-ho! Olé!

835
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,027
Mike, look out. You'll get killed.

836
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:56,895
- Mike, look out!

837
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:10,804
Whoa! Hey!

838
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:13,939
- Whoa! Whoa!

839
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:16,176
Are you all right?

840
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:18,753
Of course I'm all right.

841
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:21,015
Hey, hey! Stop!

842
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:27,419
Hey, where-where'd you go?

843
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,589
Who asked you to help?

844
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:32,565
Yeah. We were doing fine
till you showed up.

845
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:35,296
Always trying to mix in,
aren't you, Robert?

846
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:37,668
I thought you might get hurt.

847
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:39,934
Don't worry about me.

848
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:43,303
Don't ever worry about me.

849
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:46,609
I've lost my check. Blast it!

850
01:09:50,052 --> 01:09:52,850
- What's he doing now?

851
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:55,253
Well, it looks like he's lost something.

852
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:57,348
- Probably his check.

853
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,070
Is that it?

854
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:15,702
There it is!

855
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:26,521
- Found it.
- Oh, look. Look, he's found it.

856
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:41,065
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

857
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:46,998
He went right over.

858
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,826
Hola, Jake.

859
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:16,095
- Here are your tickets.
- Oh, thank you.

860
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:19,902
- Would you like to come and see Pedro Romero before the fight?
- I don't want to bother him.

861
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:23,911
- Oh, it will be no bother at all. Come with me now.
- Bill? Bill, come on.

862
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:26,038
Huh?

863
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:40,727
Who's this Romero, Jake?

864
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:42,729
One of the boys fighting this afternoon.

865
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:44,958
They say he's gonna be
one of the greats.

866
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:56,844
- Come in. Hola.
- Okay.

867
01:11:56,945 --> 01:11:59,914
Pedro.

868
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:02,449
- Senor Barnes.
- Senor.

869
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:04,815
- Senor Gorton.
- Senor.

870
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,911
- How are you?
- Pedro Romero.

871
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:10,753
- Did you go to the bullfight today?
- Oh, you speak English.

872
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:13,327
- No.
- But I speak it.

873
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:16,830
Is there anything you would like
to ask my brother Pedro?

874
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:19,765
No, no. No. We just wanted
to wish him good luck.

875
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:22,063
I see. Thank you.

876
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,731
- Thank you.

877
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,400
- Yes, good luck.
- Gracias.

878
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,580
- Where are Robert and Mike?
- Oh, at the Cafe Iruna.

879
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:43,487
He looks like a torero.
Don't you think so? He is the type.

880
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:45,492
Well, he's a good-looking kid,
all right.

881
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:47,755
It is important for a torero
to look like that.

882
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:51,321
If he has everything else- the valor,
the knowledge- but he does not look right...

883
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:54,197
then he can never
give you everything in the ring.

884
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:57,136
- That rules out Mike and me.
- That rules out most people.

885
01:12:57,239 --> 01:12:59,673
- I will see you after the fight.
- Right.

886
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:04,144
- Ah.
- Here are the tickets.

887
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:07,079
Two barreras for Bill and me
and three seats for you.

888
01:13:07,182 --> 01:13:09,241
- Wonderful.
- Will you be all right?

889
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:11,581
I'm a little nervous,
but I think I'll be all right.

890
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:14,952
- What about you, Robert?
- I'm only worried that I might get bored.

891
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:20,125
Do you think so? Do you really think
you might get bored?

892
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,993
Don’t watch the horses after the bull
hits them. Just look away.

893
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:26,397
Oh, don’t worry about Brett.
I'll take care of her.

894
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:29,494
I'm only worrying
about Robert getting bored.

895
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:31,903
Well, I'll see you later.
Come on, Bill.

896
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:53,141
Bully, bully, bully! Where's the bull?

897
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:55,148
Oh, Michael, sit down.

898
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:02,780
Olé! Olé!

899
01:17:02,884 --> 01:17:07,048
Olé! Olé!

900
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:20,625
Olé!

901
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:25,036
Olé! Olé!

902
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:29,202
Olé!

903
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:33,581
Olé!

904
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:36,276
- Olé!

905
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:40,947
Olé! Olé!

906
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:45,552
Olé!

907
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:53,192
Olé!

908
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:56,498
Olé!

909
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:58,835
Olé!

910
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:01,170
Olé!

911
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:24,231
Does Cohn look bored now?

912
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:27,768
No. Neither does Brett.

913
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:38,679
Oh, there they are.

914
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:44,712
Jake, I say, that fellow
Romeo what's-his-name-

915
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,687
He's really something, isn't he?
Or am I wrong?

916
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:50,758
- He's a bullfighter, all right.

917
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:53,419
- Where's Brett?
- Oh, she went upstairs to change.

918
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:56,895
- You weren't bored, were you, Robert?
- No, I wasn't bored.

919
01:18:56,998 --> 01:18:59,432
I hope you’ll forgive me for that.

920
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:01,559
There she is now.

921
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:06,505
Beautiful. My dear. Fantastic as usual.

922
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:10,100
Oh, what a crowd. Couldn't we go
someplace quiet for a change?

923
01:19:10,212 --> 01:19:12,112
Well, I think that could be arranged.

924
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:15,445
- Shall we try the dining room?
- Right.

925
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:18,041
- Have you recovered?
- Almost.

926
01:19:18,153 --> 01:19:20,644
These bullfights are rather hard
on one, aren't they?

927
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:40,005
Hey, I think our Brett's getting
a little too interested in bullfighters.

928
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:42,042
I couldn't agree more.

929
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:44,908
Jake, be a good fellow
and don't tell her any more about 'em.

930
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:47,538
Tell her how they beat
their poor old mothers.

931
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:49,708
Yes, and tell me
what drunks they are.

932
01:19:49,818 --> 01:19:51,809
Oh, frightening. Drunk all day.

933
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,218
And beat their poor old mothers
all night long.

934
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:56,984
- Yes, he looks the type.
- Excuse me just a minute.

935
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:04,724
I just wanted to tell you how much
I enjoyed your work this afternoon.

936
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:08,132
Jake, you might introduce us
to your friends.

937
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:11,069
Would you come
and have a drink with us?

938
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:15,041
Yes. I like.

939
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:20,671
- Senor Romero, Lady Ashley, Mr. Cohn.
- How do you do?

940
01:20:20,782 --> 01:20:22,716
- Mr. Campbell. Bill Gorton you know.
- Olé.

941
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:24,809
- Hello, senor.

942
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:27,718
Since watching you
in the bullring this afternoon...

943
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,757
I'm ashamed of being a writer.

944
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:32,759
This gentleman is a writer.
This one too.

945
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:34,920
And the other senor-
What does he do?

946
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:37,225
Tell him the bulls
had no horns today.

947
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:39,095
What does he mean?

948
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:42,500
Go ahead, Jake.
Tell him the bulls had no horns today.

949
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,165
He's drunk. Borracho.

950
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:50,574
Tell him Brett just wants to see him
in those blue pants again.

951
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:53,648
- Pipe down, Mike.
- May I offer you a toast to-

952
01:20:53,748 --> 01:20:56,182
- To Pedro Romero.
- Gracias.

953
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:06,392
Pedro?

954
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:10,793
I'm sorry. I... must go. Adios.

955
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:12,958
- Adios.
- Senora.

956
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:26,302
Oh, he's charming, polite-
something you wouldn't expect at all.

957
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:29,178
I wanted to tell him
what I thought of the bulls...

958
01:21:29,284 --> 01:21:31,252
but old Jake kept interrupting me.

959
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:33,412
Nobody was interrupting you.

960
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:36,752
Oh, Jake did. But-

961
01:21:36,858 --> 01:21:39,554
I'd like to get this thing settled.

962
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:43,324
Uh, you-What have you
got to say about it?

963
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:47,765
Or are you just gonna sit there, as usual,
looking quietly superior?

964
01:21:47,869 --> 01:21:50,167
Cut it out, will you, Mike?

965
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:52,672
Of course, I'm not
one of you literary fellows.

966
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:56,471
I'm not clever at all.
But I do know when I'm not wanted.

967
01:21:56,578 --> 01:22:01,015
Now, why don't you just take
that sad face and go away, hmm?

968
01:22:01,116 --> 01:22:03,311
- Don't you think I'm right, Jake?
- Sure. Sure.

969
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:05,477
Let's all go over to the Iruna.

970
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:07,817
No, uh-uh. I want to know
if I'm right.

971
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:11,586
You see, I happen to love
that woman sitting there.

972
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:14,287
Oh, don't start that again, Mike.
Shove it along, will you, darling?

973
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:17,627
I know what I'm saying.
Jake does too.

974
01:22:17,732 --> 01:22:21,793
So, just go away, hmm? Go away.

975
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:27,331
- But I won't go.
- Oh.

976
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:29,876
Then I suppose I shall have to make you.

977
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:32,071
- Come on.

978
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:34,410
- What's that?
- It's the fireworks.

979
01:22:34,516 --> 01:22:37,076
Come on, Mike. Let's go out
and have a look at the show.

980
01:22:37,185 --> 01:22:40,484
- Fireworks? Good idea.
- It's outside. You can see it from there.

981
01:23:31,706 --> 01:23:34,436
Globos illuminados.

982
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:39,774
A bunch of bloody fireworks all fizzling.

983
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:43,749
That's us.

984
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:47,720
If he's getting philosophical again, Jake,
we'd better get out of here.

985
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:49,756
- Mike?
- Hmm?

986
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:52,918
- Her Ladyship wants a drink.
- Oh, how you know things.

987
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:56,191
Oh, well, go ahead. I'll join you.

988
01:23:56,297 --> 01:23:58,197
We'll see you later.

989
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:02,163
Magnificent display, is it not?

990
01:24:13,915 --> 01:24:16,383
- Oh!
- Let's go in here.

991
01:24:42,844 --> 01:24:46,177
Jake, I'm so sick and tired
of the whole thing-

992
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:48,909
Robert, Michael, the whole group.

993
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:51,918
Well, it's been hard on Mike
having Robert around.

994
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:55,751
Yes, I know. But he doesn't
have to behave like that.

995
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:59,020
Everyone behaves badly,
given the proper chance.

996
01:25:00,361 --> 01:25:02,522
You wouldn't behave badly.

997
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:07,158
I don't know. I- I'd probably be
as big a fool as Mike or Robert.

998
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:09,759
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

999
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:14,606
You think the whole thing's my fault,
don't you, Jake?

1000
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:20,907
Well, let's say that I don't think
you’re just an innocent bystander.

1001
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:23,813
It's funny, but, you know...

1002
01:25:23,918 --> 01:25:26,216
I really thought we had a chance-

1003
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:28,380
Michael and I.

1004
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:30,390
I should have known better.

1005
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:33,552
But I was so happy
when he arrived in San Sebastian.

1006
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:35,629
- Was he sober?
- Yes, he was.

1007
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:39,257
But it's not the drinking.
It's not anything he does.

1008
01:25:41,236 --> 01:25:44,069
And what about Cohn?

1009
01:25:44,172 --> 01:25:47,664
Did you think you had a chance there too?

1010
01:25:47,775 --> 01:25:50,300
Oh, don't be difficult, Jake.

1011
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:53,244
I feel badly enough as it is tonight.

1012
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:55,976
Can I have some coffee?

1013
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:58,678
They don't have any coffee here.

1014
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:00,913
- It stopped raining. Shall we go?
- Mm-hmm.

1015
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:03,923
Dos pesetas.

1016
01:26:08,129 --> 01:26:10,723
Gracias.

1017
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:15,026
No, this way.

1018
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:22,771
- He was there.
- Yes.

1019
01:26:22,877 --> 01:26:26,938
Can't stand to be away from you.
I feel sorry for him.

1020
01:26:27,048 --> 01:26:29,039
I don't. I hate him.

1021
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:32,517
I hate his suffering.
He enjoys it.

1022
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:25,082
- Dos cafés, por favor.
- Si, senor.

1023
01:27:25,185 --> 01:27:28,211
I've changed my mind.
I want a brandy.

1024
01:27:28,322 --> 01:27:30,756
- Caballero.
- Senor.

1025
01:27:30,858 --> 01:27:34,259
- Con mucho gusto.

1026
01:27:50,544 --> 01:27:53,274
Oh, there's Romero.

1027
01:27:58,886 --> 01:28:01,047
- Gracias.
- Por nada.

1028
01:28:04,124 --> 01:28:06,456
Oh, he's coming over.

1029
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,892
- Buenos noches.
- Buenos noches.

1030
01:28:08,996 --> 01:28:11,726
- Senora.
- Won't you sit down and join us?

1031
01:28:11,832 --> 01:28:13,993
- For a moment, yes.
- Will you have a drink with us?

1032
01:28:14,101 --> 01:28:17,502
- No, I am with some people over there.
- You fight tomorrow, hmm?

1033
01:28:17,604 --> 01:28:20,539
Si. But not with Algabena.
He was hurt today in Madrid.

1034
01:28:20,641 --> 01:28:23,542
- Did you hear?
- No. Badly?

1035
01:28:23,644 --> 01:28:28,513
- No, it was here. Nothing.
- May I?

1036
01:28:32,586 --> 01:28:35,248
- You tell fortunes?
- Sometimes.

1037
01:28:35,355 --> 01:28:38,051
- Do you mind?
- No, I like it.

1038
01:28:38,158 --> 01:28:40,683
Tell me that I will live for always...

1039
01:28:40,794 --> 01:28:43,228
and I will be a millionaire.

1040
01:28:43,330 --> 01:28:46,959
- Do you see any bulls in my hand?
- Oh, yes, thousands of them.

1041
01:28:47,067 --> 01:28:49,467
Good!
Then a thousand duros apiece.

1042
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:51,538
Tell me some more.

1043
01:28:51,638 --> 01:28:55,404
Oh, it's a very good hand.
I think you’ll live a long time.

1044
01:28:55,509 --> 01:28:58,239
Say it to me, not to your friend.

1045
01:28:58,345 --> 01:29:00,575
I said that you would live a long time.

1046
01:29:00,681 --> 01:29:03,047
I know it.
I am never going to die.

1047
01:29:04,318 --> 01:29:08,186
No, don't do that.
The bulls are my best friends.

1048
01:29:08,288 --> 01:29:10,882
Do you always kill your friends?

1049
01:29:10,991 --> 01:29:15,087
Always. So they... do not kill me.

1050
01:29:15,195 --> 01:29:17,595
You know English very well, don’t you?

1051
01:29:17,698 --> 01:29:20,690
Si. Pretty well sometimes...

1052
01:29:20,801 --> 01:29:24,259
but I must not let anybody know.

1053
01:29:24,371 --> 01:29:28,740
It would be very bad for a torero
who speaks English.

1054
01:29:28,842 --> 01:29:31,037
Oh, yes? Why?

1055
01:29:31,144 --> 01:29:33,874
Well, bullfighters
are not supposed to be like that.

1056
01:29:33,981 --> 01:29:38,543
- What are bullfighters supposed to be like?

1057
01:29:38,652 --> 01:29:42,418
Like at that table over there.

1058
01:29:42,523 --> 01:29:46,653
No, I- I must forget my English.

1059
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:49,228
Oh, not for a little while yet.

1060
01:29:49,329 --> 01:29:51,593
- No?
- No.

1061
01:29:51,698 --> 01:29:53,598
All right.

1062
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:57,136
Excuse me. I'll go see
what happened to Bill and Mike.

1063
01:29:57,237 --> 01:30:00,798
No, no, no. Sit down.
I just want to go find our friends.

1064
01:30:14,888 --> 01:30:17,152
I'd like another brandy, please.

1065
01:30:23,463 --> 01:30:27,194
Will you... finish telling my fortune?

1066
01:30:28,535 --> 01:30:32,027
Of course.
But it might take a little while.

1067
01:30:32,139 --> 01:30:35,802
Since you say I will live so long...

1068
01:30:35,909 --> 01:30:37,900
I have time.

1069
01:30:38,011 --> 01:30:43,005
Of course, you mustn't believe
all the things I tell you.

1070
01:31:45,746 --> 01:31:48,647
What’d you do that for?

1071
01:31:49,916 --> 01:31:53,079
- Huh?
- You're wasting good wine, man.

1072
01:31:55,689 --> 01:31:58,089
Well, there was a fly in my glass.

1073
01:31:58,191 --> 01:32:01,820
There's been a fly in every glass I've had
since I came down here.

1074
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:05,564
What's the matter?

1075
01:32:05,666 --> 01:32:08,658
I don't know. I'm just low. That's all.

1076
01:32:08,769 --> 01:32:12,296
Oh, come on. Have a Pernod.
That's what they're for.

1077
01:32:12,406 --> 01:32:16,206
- No, that won't do any good.

1078
01:32:16,309 --> 01:32:19,142
Look, Bill, I-
I hate to let you down...

1079
01:32:19,246 --> 01:32:22,044
but I've got to get out of here.

1080
01:32:22,149 --> 01:32:25,710
What? Where do you want to go?

1081
01:32:25,819 --> 01:32:28,447
Back to Paris. Fishing.
I don't know. Anywhere.

1082
01:32:28,555 --> 01:32:30,785
Oh, come on. What's the hurry?

1083
01:32:30,891 --> 01:32:33,724
Oh, I've had it. That's all.

1084
01:32:33,827 --> 01:32:36,887
Look, here. Here's some money.

1085
01:32:36,997 --> 01:32:39,124
Pay my share of the hotel bill...

1086
01:32:39,232 --> 01:32:42,065
and if there’s anything left,
I'll pick it up from you later.

1087
01:32:42,169 --> 01:32:45,002
Jake, I know how you feel.

1088
01:32:46,339 --> 01:32:48,603
You know how I feel?

1089
01:32:48,709 --> 01:32:51,473
No, you don't.
But why should you?

1090
01:32:51,578 --> 01:32:54,547
- Come on, Jake. Take it easy.
- Don't give me advice.

1091
01:32:54,648 --> 01:32:57,879
- I'm not giving you-
- And don't try to tell me how to live with myself.

1092
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:02,011
I know all about that. It's living with
other people that gets tough once in a while.

1093
01:33:02,122 --> 01:33:04,716
Jake, Jake, come here.
Take it easy here. Come on.

1094
01:33:04,825 --> 01:33:08,317
- Talk about it in the morning. Do me a favor.
- Jake! Bill!

1095
01:33:08,495 --> 01:33:11,328
There you are.
I've been looking everywhere for you.

1096
01:33:11,431 --> 01:33:14,662
Come on. Join us.
Ladies, pray be seated.

1097
01:33:14,768 --> 01:33:18,135
Come on, little one.
There you are, my dear.

1098
01:33:18,238 --> 01:33:23,141
You know something? I've been thrown out
of three cafés since I've seen you last.

1099
01:33:23,243 --> 01:33:26,076
Only these little senoritas rescued me.

1100
01:33:26,179 --> 01:33:28,943
You're very lucky. All of you, I mean.

1101
01:33:29,049 --> 01:33:31,381
Do you know,
they don't speak a word of English.

1102
01:33:31,485 --> 01:33:34,511
They always seem to be thirsty.
Oh, little darlings.

1103
01:33:34,621 --> 01:33:37,351
Waiter! Oh, waiter!

1104
01:33:37,457 --> 01:33:39,357
Waiter?

1105
01:33:39,459 --> 01:33:42,485
Psst! Tsk, tsk, tsk. Garçon! Boy!

1106
01:33:42,596 --> 01:33:44,723
- Nobody home.

1107
01:33:44,831 --> 01:33:46,731
You know something?

1108
01:33:46,833 --> 01:33:50,826
The service around this town
is getting worse and worse every night.

1109
01:33:50,937 --> 01:33:53,565
Perhaps it's me.

1110
01:33:53,673 --> 01:33:55,732
Thank you.

1111
01:33:55,842 --> 01:33:58,811
As a matter of fact, I'm afraid it is me.

1112
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:01,437
Nobody seems to pay
much attention to me anymore.

1113
01:34:01,548 --> 01:34:04,881
Perhaps the word has leaked out
about your finances.

1114
01:34:04,985 --> 01:34:06,885
A definite possibility.

1115
01:34:06,987 --> 01:34:08,887
- Waiter!
- Where is Brett?

1116
01:34:10,423 --> 01:34:13,187
- I don't know.
- She was with you.

1117
01:34:13,293 --> 01:34:16,524
Well, maybe she's gone home to bed.
Sit down, Robert. I don't know where she is.

1118
01:34:16,630 --> 01:34:18,564
Don't lie. You do know.

1119
01:34:18,665 --> 01:34:21,190
- I'm not lying.
- Oh, shut up, Cohn.

1120
01:34:21,301 --> 01:34:23,735
She's probably gone off
with a bullfighter.

1121
01:34:23,837 --> 01:34:26,032
Maybe they're married by now.

1122
01:34:26,139 --> 01:34:28,437
- Is that where she is?
- Go away, Robert.

1123
01:34:28,542 --> 01:34:31,170
She was with you.
Is that where she is?

1124
01:34:31,278 --> 01:34:34,213
- I'll make you tell me!
- You miserable-

1125
01:34:34,314 --> 01:34:36,578
- Waiter!

1126
01:34:36,683 --> 01:34:40,642
- Why, you absolute ruffian!

1127
01:34:51,698 --> 01:34:53,757
Jake! Jake!

1128
01:34:58,371 --> 01:35:00,566
- Are you all right, man?

1129
01:35:00,674 --> 01:35:02,505
Take it easy.

1130
01:35:02,609 --> 01:35:04,668
Wait a minute. Hold on.

1131
01:35:11,184 --> 01:35:13,778
You crazy Americans! Please go!

1132
01:35:13,887 --> 01:35:16,481
I beg your pardon.
I am not an American.

1133
01:35:19,593 --> 01:35:22,061
I say, old boy, you were out cold.

1134
01:35:22,162 --> 01:35:24,357
- Where were you?
- Oh, I was around.

1135
01:35:24,464 --> 01:35:26,364
He knocked Mike down too.

1136
01:35:26,466 --> 01:35:29,299
- Fellow must be a boxer.
- Yes, he is.

1137
01:35:30,637 --> 01:35:33,265
Who hit me?

1138
01:36:13,246 --> 01:36:15,305
Robert, go away.

1139
01:36:15,415 --> 01:36:17,576
Please, please, leave.

1140
01:36:17,684 --> 01:36:21,484
Robert! Robert, stop it!

1141
01:36:21,588 --> 01:36:24,318
Stop it! Robert, stop it!

1142
01:36:25,592 --> 01:36:27,685
- Stop it!

1143
01:36:27,794 --> 01:36:30,661
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

1144
01:36:30,764 --> 01:36:33,358
Get out! Stop it.

1145
01:36:34,901 --> 01:36:38,496
Robert, stop it! Robert!
Robert, stop it!

1146
01:36:38,605 --> 01:36:41,165
- Stop it!

1147
01:36:41,274 --> 01:36:44,141
Stop it!

1148
01:36:50,583 --> 01:36:52,642
Robert! Robert! Listen to me!

1149
01:36:52,752 --> 01:36:54,777
Please listen to me! Please, Robert!

1150
01:36:54,888 --> 01:36:57,254
Robert, listen to me!
Listen! You must go!

1151
01:36:57,357 --> 01:37:00,121
Don't you understand
what you're doing? Robert!

1152
01:37:00,226 --> 01:37:02,854
- Robert!
- Oh, Brett.

1153
01:37:05,031 --> 01:37:08,728
- What have I done?
- Please, you must go, Robert.

1154
01:37:08,835 --> 01:37:10,735
Please.

1155
01:37:12,238 --> 01:37:14,672
I love you, Brett.

1156
01:37:15,909 --> 01:37:18,901
Please leave now.

1157
01:37:21,147 --> 01:37:24,514
Pedro. Pedro.

1158
01:37:24,617 --> 01:37:27,279
Pedro. Pedro.

1159
01:38:05,592 --> 01:38:09,050
Well, here's old Jake,
the human punching bag.

1160
01:38:09,162 --> 01:38:11,323
- Ooh.

1161
01:38:11,431 --> 01:38:14,298
- Very funny.
- How do you feel?

1162
01:38:14,401 --> 01:38:16,596
About the way those guys look.

1163
01:38:22,976 --> 01:38:25,444
Let's go find Mike.

1164
01:38:42,462 --> 01:38:44,453
Gentlemen, good morning.

1165
01:38:44,564 --> 01:38:46,623
I was wondering
what had become of you.

1166
01:38:46,733 --> 01:38:49,668
- How are you, Mike?
- Never better, dear boy. Never better.

1167
01:38:49,769 --> 01:38:52,795
Well, as good as can be expected.

1168
01:38:52,906 --> 01:38:55,534
- Sit down. Sit down. Have your shoes shined.
- No, no. Thanks.

1169
01:38:55,642 --> 01:38:58,702
- I've had mine done seven times.
- They look pretty clean.

1170
01:38:58,812 --> 01:39:01,906
Ah, yes. But you cannot get
these fellows to agree.

1171
01:39:02,015 --> 01:39:05,075
- El senor, huh?
- No, no. No.

1172
01:39:05,185 --> 01:39:09,383
Oh, need somebody for old Jake.
Can't leave him sitting around doing nothing.

1173
01:39:09,489 --> 01:39:11,684
No, I'm all right. I guess.

1174
01:39:11,791 --> 01:39:15,090
Jake, you may think you’re all right...

1175
01:39:15,195 --> 01:39:17,163
but your shoes need shining.

1176
01:39:17,263 --> 01:39:19,254
Now, look-

1177
01:39:19,365 --> 01:39:22,027
Oh.

1178
01:39:22,135 --> 01:39:24,365
Here comes Her Ladyship.

1179
01:39:26,773 --> 01:39:29,241
- Brett.
- I'm glad I found you.

1180
01:39:29,342 --> 01:39:32,470
- Uh, more beer.
- Si, senor.

1181
01:39:32,579 --> 01:39:35,343
- More shrimps. Gambas.
- Muy bien.

1182
01:39:35,448 --> 01:39:37,973
- Has Robert left yet?
- I don't know.

1183
01:39:38,084 --> 01:39:40,177
Nobody's seen him since last night.

1184
01:39:40,286 --> 01:39:43,187
- How's Romero?
- He's all right. He won't leave his room.

1185
01:39:43,289 --> 01:39:46,122
- Is he badly hurt?
- Yes, but he's going to fight this afternoon.

1186
01:39:48,428 --> 01:39:50,862
Brett has got a bullfighter.

1187
01:39:50,964 --> 01:39:55,492
She had a bloody nuisance for a while,
but that didn't work out.

1188
01:39:56,836 --> 01:40:01,068
Now she's got a bullfighter
with blue pants.

1189
01:40:01,174 --> 01:40:05,702
And where am I? I'm sitting here
having my shoes shined.

1190
01:40:05,812 --> 01:40:08,076
Mike, take it easy, huh?
Take it easy.

1191
01:40:08,181 --> 01:40:10,911
Tell me, Lady Brett,
how is your boyfriend?

1192
01:40:11,017 --> 01:40:13,918
Very well.
Watch him this afternoon.

1193
01:40:17,824 --> 01:40:20,224
Will you walk with me, Jake?
I'd like to talk to you.

1194
01:40:20,326 --> 01:40:24,695
Yes, go ahead.
Tell him all about your bull fighter.

1195
01:40:34,974 --> 01:40:36,874
To hell with your bullfighter!

1196
01:40:41,948 --> 01:40:44,246
- It's all right. It's all right.

1197
01:40:44,350 --> 01:40:46,614
I'll pay for it. Be quiet!

1198
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:50,052
Don’t worry about a thing.
I shall pay for everything.

1199
01:40:50,156 --> 01:40:53,125
- Oh, be quiet, will you! I'll take care-

1200
01:40:53,226 --> 01:40:55,126
Si, senor.

1201
01:40:57,430 --> 01:41:00,228
A ridiculous-looking type.
I think I'll teach him a lesson.

1202
01:41:03,303 --> 01:41:07,034
- He's just playing. Come on. Let's go.

1203
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:09,199
Rather bad form, that, wasn't it?

1204
01:41:09,309 --> 01:41:11,641
Forget it, Mike.
We all have our moments.

1205
01:41:11,744 --> 01:41:14,269
- That policeman- He struck me.
- Mike, forget it!

1206
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:16,280
- I'm going back-
- No, you're not!

1207
01:41:16,382 --> 01:41:18,350
I am!

1208
01:41:18,451 --> 01:41:21,113
I forgot my binoculars.

1209
01:41:23,590 --> 01:41:26,286
Is there, uh, anything
you want me to do?

1210
01:41:26,392 --> 01:41:28,292
No, just walk with me.

1211
01:41:28,394 --> 01:41:31,227
I don’t want to go in yet.
He's still asleep.

1212
01:41:31,331 --> 01:41:35,392
- I wish the wind would die down.

1213
01:41:35,501 --> 01:41:37,935
It's dangerous for him.

1214
01:41:38,037 --> 01:41:39,971
I know.

1215
01:41:40,073 --> 01:41:42,564
He says the bulls are all right.

1216
01:41:42,675 --> 01:41:44,575
They are good.

1217
01:41:48,681 --> 01:41:51,241
Will you wait for me a minute?

1218
01:43:28,948 --> 01:43:32,384
You know, I'm really not worried about him.
I know he'll be all right.

1219
01:43:32,485 --> 01:43:35,545
I do wish the wind would drop.

1220
01:43:35,655 --> 01:43:37,885
It may go down by 5:00.

1221
01:43:37,990 --> 01:43:40,322
Let's hope so.

1222
01:43:40,426 --> 01:43:44,362
Is, uh, that what you were praying for?

1223
01:43:45,865 --> 01:43:47,958
No, I was praying for him.

1224
01:43:51,938 --> 01:43:55,271
You will look after Mike,
won't you, Jake?

1225
01:43:55,375 --> 01:43:57,275
Yeah.

1226
01:43:59,545 --> 01:44:01,513
What are you thinking?

1227
01:44:04,617 --> 01:44:07,780
Just lucky that I'm around
to look after your wounded.

1228
01:44:56,903 --> 01:44:58,803
He looks frightened.

1229
01:44:58,905 --> 01:45:01,339
He's young.
He doesn't know much.

1230
01:45:01,441 --> 01:45:04,205
Don't listen to anything.
Just watch.

1231
01:45:10,983 --> 01:45:14,612
Olé! Olé!

1232
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:17,712
Olé!

1233
01:45:19,125 --> 01:45:21,685
Olé!

1234
01:45:23,162 --> 01:45:25,062
Olé!

1235
01:45:25,164 --> 01:45:29,965
Olé! Olé!

1236
01:45:31,471 --> 01:45:33,996
Olé!

1237
01:45:35,308 --> 01:45:37,299
Olé!

1238
01:45:53,259 --> 01:45:55,159
Agua.

1239
01:46:44,243 --> 01:46:46,143
Olé!

1240
01:46:47,547 --> 01:46:51,984
Olé! Olé!

1241
01:46:53,819 --> 01:46:58,222
Olé! Olé!

1242
01:47:00,293 --> 01:47:03,990
Olé! Olé!

1243
01:47:21,614 --> 01:47:23,582
Only one pic.

1244
01:47:23,683 --> 01:47:26,777
He's certainly not gonna live
to be a very old bullfighter.

1245
01:47:26,886 --> 01:47:29,684
It's empty.

1246
01:47:35,928 --> 01:47:37,862
Agua.

1247
01:47:39,632 --> 01:47:42,100
Romero!

1248
01:47:45,071 --> 01:47:49,565
Romero! Romero! Romero!

1249
01:47:49,675 --> 01:47:55,045
Romero! Romero! Romero!

1250
01:47:55,147 --> 01:47:59,846
Romero! Romero! Romero!

1251
01:47:59,952 --> 01:48:03,251
- Romero! Romero! Romero!
- What do they want?

1252
01:48:03,356 --> 01:48:06,757
They want him to place
his own banderias.

1253
01:48:06,859 --> 01:48:09,760
- Romero! Romero!
- Oh, but he can't. He's all bruised.

1254
01:48:09,862 --> 01:48:14,959
Romero! Romero! Romero!

1255
01:48:15,067 --> 01:48:17,797
- Romero! Romero!

1256
01:49:55,534 --> 01:49:57,593
For you.

1257
01:50:15,387 --> 01:50:18,288
Olé!

1258
01:50:18,390 --> 01:50:21,086
Olé!

1259
01:50:21,193 --> 01:50:23,286
Olé!

1260
01:50:23,395 --> 01:50:27,633
- Olé!

1261
01:50:30,136 --> 01:50:33,037
Oh, this is a special kind of hell.

1262
01:50:33,139 --> 01:50:35,767
Their women usually stay at home.

1263
01:50:35,875 --> 01:50:38,673
I can understand why.

1264
01:50:44,817 --> 01:50:47,183
Olé!

1265
01:50:47,286 --> 01:50:50,619
- Olé!

1266
01:50:50,723 --> 01:50:53,590
- Olé!
- Toro!

1267
01:50:53,692 --> 01:50:58,061
Olé! Olé!

1268
01:51:01,033 --> 01:51:05,060
Olé! Olé!

1269
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:11,705
Olé!

1270
01:51:11,811 --> 01:51:14,245
Olé!

1271
01:51:14,346 --> 01:51:18,043
Olé! Olé!

1272
01:51:18,150 --> 01:51:21,381
- Toro!
- Olé!

1273
01:51:21,487 --> 01:51:24,115
Olé!

1274
01:51:24,223 --> 01:51:28,557
Olé! Olé!

1275
01:51:38,070 --> 01:51:42,632
Olé! Olé!

1276
01:53:28,347 --> 01:53:30,247
Senor.

1277
01:53:43,128 --> 01:53:45,494
Romero would like to speak to you.

1278
01:53:45,597 --> 01:53:47,565
He'll take you to him.

1279
01:53:47,666 --> 01:53:50,328
- I'll meet you at the hotel.

1280
01:54:14,493 --> 01:54:17,018
Jake?

1281
01:54:17,129 --> 01:54:19,029
Jake!

1282
01:54:21,033 --> 01:54:23,228
Well, what is it, Robert?

1283
01:54:23,335 --> 01:54:27,465
About last night, Jake-
I wasn't myself.

1284
01:54:27,573 --> 01:54:30,235
No? Then who hit me?

1285
01:54:30,342 --> 01:54:32,936
I know nothing I can say
will change matters...

1286
01:54:33,045 --> 01:54:36,481
but... I was in love with her, Jake.

1287
01:54:36,582 --> 01:54:39,551
That's why I took everything.

1288
01:54:39,651 --> 01:54:42,211
I knew right from the beginning
it was hopeless...

1289
01:54:42,321 --> 01:54:45,552
but I couldn't resign myself to the fact.

1290
01:54:45,657 --> 01:54:47,625
I hung around.

1291
01:54:47,726 --> 01:54:52,390
I hung around when I knew
I should get out, but I couldn't go, Jake.

1292
01:54:55,667 --> 01:54:59,159
People always want
what they can't have, I guess.

1293
01:54:59,271 --> 01:55:02,866
I don't know. She was the only person
I ever met who made any sense to me.

1294
01:55:04,743 --> 01:55:07,007
- Forget it, Robert.
- But-

1295
01:55:08,814 --> 01:55:11,544
You were the only friend I had, Jake.

1296
01:55:11,650 --> 01:55:14,881
Forget it. It wasn't all your fault.

1297
01:55:14,987 --> 01:55:17,217
Have a drink.
I'll see you tonight at dinner.

1298
01:55:17,322 --> 01:55:19,449
I'm leaving tonight.

1299
01:55:19,558 --> 01:55:23,619
- Where are you going?
- To Paris... and then America.

1300
01:55:23,729 --> 01:55:27,221
I'm going to see Frances
and try to straighten things out.

1301
01:55:27,332 --> 01:55:30,233
I only hope I'm not too late.

1302
01:55:30,335 --> 01:55:33,862
I hope so too. Good luck, Robert.

1303
01:55:37,242 --> 01:55:39,142
Thanks, Jake.

1304
01:56:15,347 --> 01:56:17,815
Enter, friend or foe.

1305
01:56:19,318 --> 01:56:22,776
Oh, Jake. Come in, old boy.

1306
01:56:29,862 --> 01:56:32,353
Yes, Brett's gone.

1307
01:56:32,464 --> 01:56:34,955
Gone off with her bullfighter.

1308
01:56:35,067 --> 01:56:37,092
Frankly, I don't think
she should have done it.

1309
01:56:37,202 --> 01:56:39,466
Very bad, actually.

1310
01:56:39,571 --> 01:56:43,063
- Oh, Jake, care for a drink?
- No. No.

1311
01:56:43,175 --> 01:56:45,507
- I can ring down and get you some.
- No, no, thanks.

1312
01:56:45,611 --> 01:56:48,603
- I was just going upstairs to lie down.
- Oh.

1313
01:56:48,714 --> 01:56:52,810
You know, I- I told her
she was making a mistake...

1314
01:56:54,153 --> 01:56:56,121
asking for trouble.

1315
01:56:56,221 --> 01:56:58,189
You know what she did?

1316
01:56:58,290 --> 01:57:00,281
She said something rather funny.

1317
01:57:00,392 --> 01:57:03,225
She said,
"Oh, I've given up such a lot.

1318
01:57:03,328 --> 01:57:07,128
I've had such a happy life
with the British aristocracy. "

1319
01:57:07,232 --> 01:57:09,928
Pretty funny, don’t you think?

1320
01:57:10,035 --> 01:57:13,801
Ah, Brett. Dear, dear Brett.

1321
01:57:13,906 --> 01:57:18,809
Uh, Jake, just out of curiosity,
are you drunk?

1322
01:57:18,911 --> 01:57:21,004
No.

1323
01:57:21,113 --> 01:57:24,378
I see. Well, I am.

1324
01:57:24,483 --> 01:57:26,713
Why don’t you try
to get some sleep, Mike?

1325
01:57:26,818 --> 01:57:29,685
Mm-hmm. I will, old boy.
A little later, hmm?

1326
01:57:29,788 --> 01:57:34,350
Oh, Jake, uh, you won't forget
to come to dinner tonight, will you?

1327
01:57:34,459 --> 01:57:38,555
Already it seems as if
there are about six people missing.

1328
01:57:38,664 --> 01:57:42,532
Sure. I'll see you at dinner.

1329
01:57:42,634 --> 01:57:45,228
Right.

1330
01:57:45,337 --> 01:57:48,670
Bung-ho, old boy.

1331
01:57:51,543 --> 01:57:53,443
Bung-ho.

1332
01:59:00,979 --> 01:59:05,006
Well, it's all over.

1333
01:59:07,219 --> 01:59:09,619
Some fiesta.

1334
01:59:09,721 --> 01:59:12,281
It had its moments.

1335
01:59:12,391 --> 01:59:16,794
You know,
I feel rather badly about Cohn.

1336
01:59:18,764 --> 01:59:21,631
I didn't behave too well there, did I?

1337
01:59:24,036 --> 01:59:26,630
In the end, it didn't make
any difference anyway.

1338
01:59:29,207 --> 01:59:31,539
Where do you suppose he went?

1339
01:59:32,944 --> 01:59:37,313
Probably back to Frances.
He's better off that way.

1340
01:59:40,118 --> 01:59:43,713
- Where do you go now, Mike?
- Hmm? Oh, the Riviera.

1341
01:59:43,822 --> 01:59:46,723
You know, Cannes, Nice,
all that sort of stuff.

1342
01:59:46,825 --> 01:59:48,850
I'm absolutely flat broke, old boy.

1343
01:59:50,762 --> 01:59:53,754
- Do you want some money?
- Oh, no, thanks.

1344
01:59:53,865 --> 01:59:56,925
I've got my ticket.
Once I get to Nice, I'll be all right.

1345
01:59:57,035 --> 02:00:00,129
Loads of credit there.
How soon do you leave for New York?

1346
02:00:00,238 --> 02:00:02,399
I sail on the 17th.

1347
02:00:02,507 --> 02:00:05,670
I shall miss you, old boy.

1348
02:00:05,777 --> 02:00:07,870
I shall miss both of you.

1349
02:00:11,850 --> 02:00:14,341
I'm gonna go say good-bye
to Montoya.

1350
02:00:14,453 --> 02:00:17,081
Meet you at the car.

1351
02:00:20,525 --> 02:00:23,050
You're sure you’ll be all right?

1352
02:00:23,161 --> 02:00:26,562
No question about it. Waiter?

1353
02:00:26,665 --> 02:00:28,929
- Si, senor.
- A small Fundador, please.

1354
02:00:29,034 --> 02:00:31,002
- Esta bien.
- Limpia?

1355
02:00:31,103 --> 02:00:33,230
Limpia?

1356
02:00:34,506 --> 02:00:36,474
Go ahead, amigo.

1357
02:00:52,457 --> 02:00:54,425
Juanito?

1358
02:00:54,526 --> 02:00:57,256
I wanted to say good-bye.

1359
02:00:57,362 --> 02:00:59,489
Adios.

1360
02:00:59,598 --> 02:01:05,230
I also wanted to say how badly I feel
about this Romero business.

1361
02:01:05,337 --> 02:01:07,498
That was his brother.

1362
02:01:07,606 --> 02:01:11,042
Romero was to fight next Sunday
at San Sebastian.

1363
02:01:11,143 --> 02:01:15,079
Now he has sent a wire,
and he has canceled.

1364
02:01:15,180 --> 02:01:17,307
Canceled?

1365
02:01:17,416 --> 02:01:19,850
Oh, I am sorry, Juanito.

1366
02:01:19,951 --> 02:01:24,650
Que va.
It is not your fault. That is life.

1367
02:01:24,756 --> 02:01:28,954
There are always some bad things
happen at a feria.

1368
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:31,392
You and I will forget it.

1369
02:01:32,731 --> 02:01:36,428
- Let's hope so.
- I will see you next year?

1370
02:01:36,535 --> 02:01:39,902
You can count on it.
Take care of yourself, Juanito.

1371
02:01:40,005 --> 02:01:43,338
You too. If there is mail,
where shall I send it?

1372
02:01:43,442 --> 02:01:46,206
Oh, the Hotel du Palais in Biarritz.

1373
02:01:46,311 --> 02:01:50,179
I'm going there to rest for a week
before I go back to work.

1374
02:01:50,282 --> 02:01:53,274
I'm sure you need it. Adios.

1375
02:01:53,385 --> 02:01:55,876
Adios, Juanito.

1376
02:01:58,323 --> 02:02:00,951
You wouldn't believe it, would you?

1377
02:02:01,059 --> 02:02:04,495
It's all like a wonderful... nightmare.

1378
02:02:04,596 --> 02:02:08,054
I believe in anything,
including nightmares.

1379
02:02:09,501 --> 02:02:11,401
Well, let's go.

1380
02:02:33,158 --> 02:02:35,626
Pardonnez-moi.

1381
02:02:51,810 --> 02:02:53,809
Monsieur Barnes!

1382
02:03:00,685 --> 02:03:02,812
A telegram for you, sir.

1383
02:03:02,921 --> 02:03:04,821
Thank you.

1384
02:03:14,165 --> 02:03:17,726
I thought there might be a reply.
It's marked urgent.

1385
02:03:17,836 --> 02:03:19,895
Well, when is there a train for Madrid?

1386
02:03:20,005 --> 02:03:22,371
9:00 tonight, sir. The Sud Express.

1387
02:03:22,474 --> 02:03:24,704
- Can you get me a sleeper on it?
- Oh, yes, sir.

1388
02:03:24,809 --> 02:03:27,471
You do not want to send any reply?

1389
02:03:27,579 --> 02:03:30,412
- No. No, thank you. I'll do it later.
- Thank you, sir.

1390
02:03:45,564 --> 02:03:47,464
Espera.

1391
02:04:08,119 --> 02:04:10,383
Buenos dias, senor. Que desea?

1392
02:04:10,488 --> 02:04:12,456
Uh, Lady Ashley, por favor.

1393
02:04:12,557 --> 02:04:15,685
- Quien?
- Lady Brett Ashley, Senor Romero's friend.

1394
02:04:15,794 --> 02:04:18,524
Ah, Senor Romero. Maria Luisa.

1395
02:04:36,481 --> 02:04:39,541
- Who is it?
- It’s Jake.

1396
02:04:52,030 --> 02:04:54,464
Jake. Jake.

1397
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:58,200
Well, you wired that you were in trouble.

1398
02:04:58,303 --> 02:05:00,771
You're short of funds. Is that it?

1399
02:05:00,872 --> 02:05:04,899
Oh, Jake, please don't.
I can't take any more.

1400
02:05:05,010 --> 02:05:08,138
What do you have to take?
You had what you wanted.

1401
02:05:08,246 --> 02:05:10,612
That's not true.

1402
02:05:12,417 --> 02:05:15,045
You mean to tell me Romero left you?

1403
02:05:15,153 --> 02:05:18,020
No. I wish he had.
It would've been easier.

1404
02:05:18,123 --> 02:05:22,321
I had to make him go,
and I wasn't sure he would.

1405
02:05:22,427 --> 02:05:26,386
That's why I wired you.
I didn't have a cent to go away and leave him.

1406
02:05:26,498 --> 02:05:29,023
What was your hurry?

1407
02:05:30,535 --> 02:05:32,435
There was no hurry.

1408
02:05:34,539 --> 02:05:38,839
I just didn't want to hurt him,
and I knew that ultimately I would.

1409
02:05:38,943 --> 02:05:42,970
I thought I'd found someone
who might make me forget you...

1410
02:05:43,081 --> 02:05:45,572
but I found I was wrong.

1411
02:05:48,653 --> 02:05:52,089
I don't expect you to believe me.

1412
02:05:52,190 --> 02:05:55,887
You know, he's only 22 years old...

1413
02:05:55,994 --> 02:05:59,953
and I'm not gonna be one
of those women who ruin children.

1414
02:06:00,065 --> 02:06:03,262
I knew the longer it lasted,
the more it would hurt.

1415
02:06:05,336 --> 02:06:08,032
As it is,
I've only hurt his pride a little.

1416
02:06:12,210 --> 02:06:14,838
How much money do you need?

1417
02:06:14,946 --> 02:06:16,937
I don't know.

1418
02:06:21,252 --> 02:06:24,221
I'll pay you when I get back to Paris.

1419
02:06:25,356 --> 02:06:27,256
Oh, darling.

1420
02:06:27,358 --> 02:06:30,452
We could've had
such good times together.

1421
02:06:30,562 --> 02:06:33,053
Isn't it pretty to think so?

1422
02:06:33,164 --> 02:06:36,327
- Good-bye,Jake.
- Good-bye.

1423
02:06:36,434 --> 02:06:38,800
Jake!

1424
02:06:38,903 --> 02:06:41,337
Don't leave me.
Take me with you, please.

1425
02:06:41,439 --> 02:06:44,306
Don't leave me alone now.

1426
02:06:52,183 --> 02:06:54,651
All right. Pack your things
and let's get out of here.

1427
02:06:54,753 --> 02:06:56,778
No. Leave it. Leave everything.

1428
02:07:13,805 --> 02:07:18,435
You're sure you’re not going to miss
any of those things you left behind?

1429
02:07:18,543 --> 02:07:21,137
No.

1430
02:07:21,246 --> 02:07:25,444
No, I left nothing that I-
I'll really miss.

1431
02:07:28,353 --> 02:07:31,379
Don’t we pay
for the things we do though?

1432
02:07:32,891 --> 02:07:35,655
Seems to me that you said
that same thing before...

1433
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:37,955
not so very long ago.

1434
02:07:38,062 --> 02:07:41,793
You're right.
Let's not talk about it anymore.

1435
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:44,698
Let's never talk about it again.

1436
02:07:45,937 --> 02:07:48,462
Have you got a cigarette, Jake?

1437
02:07:51,776 --> 02:07:56,736
You know, he learned his English
as a waiter in Gibraltar.

1438
02:07:58,149 --> 02:08:00,413
He wanted to marry me finally.

1439
02:08:00,518 --> 02:08:03,419
Probably thought it would
make him Lord Ashley.

1440
02:08:03,521 --> 02:08:05,682
No, he really wanted to marry me.

1441
02:08:05,790 --> 02:08:08,850
He said then I couldn't go away
and leave him.

1442
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:12,589
Oh, that's the same notion
a lot of people have had.

1443
02:08:12,697 --> 02:08:15,825
Please don't be mean, Jake.

1444
02:08:18,570 --> 02:08:22,700
Look, let's really
never talk about it again.

1445
02:08:22,807 --> 02:08:24,934
It's all right with me.

1446
02:08:26,911 --> 02:08:31,610
Do you know, it makes one feel rather good
to behave decently again.

1447
02:08:33,651 --> 02:08:36,552
It's sort of what we have instead of God.

1448
02:08:37,822 --> 02:08:41,258
Some people have God... quite a lot.

1449
02:08:41,359 --> 02:08:44,123
Yes, I know.

1450
02:08:44,229 --> 02:08:46,697
He never worked very well with me.

1451
02:08:49,801 --> 02:08:52,099
Maybe you didn't really try.

1452
02:08:55,139 --> 02:08:57,039
Maybe not.

1453
02:08:57,141 --> 02:09:00,577
You know, the awful thing is
it could have been so simple...

1454
02:09:00,678 --> 02:09:03,306
because you’re the only man
I could ever love, Jake.

1455
02:09:09,554 --> 02:09:13,354
Well, where do we go from here?

1456
02:09:15,260 --> 02:09:17,160
I don't know.

1457
02:09:22,734 --> 02:09:25,066
Oh, darling...

1458
02:09:25,169 --> 02:09:27,967
there must be an answer
for us somewhere.

1459
02:09:34,579 --> 02:09:36,513
I'm sure there is.

1460
02:09:51,896 --> 02:09:54,387
One generation passes away...

1461
02:09:54,499 --> 02:09:56,592
and another generation comes...

1462
02:09:56,701 --> 02:09:59,727
but the Earth abides forever.

1463
02:09:59,837 --> 02:10:03,000
The sun also rises.

1464
02:10:04,305 --> 02:10:10,497
