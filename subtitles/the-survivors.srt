2
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,871
- Mr. Quinelle.
- Morning, Betty.

3
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,076
Mr. Stoddard wants to see you.

4
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,992
- Me?
- You can go right in.

5
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,231
Mr. Stoddard?

6
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,436
Mr. Stoddard, sir?

7
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,358
Mr. Stoddard?

8
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,755
Quinelle!

9
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,754
Good morning, Donald.

10
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,551
You have been a valuable asset
to this company.

11
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,197
So this is not easy for me to say.

12
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,954
You're fired.

13
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,073
Mr. Stoddard, you can come out now
and have your laugh. Mr. Stoddard?

14
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,148
Do you have a peanut or a cracker?

15
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,312
No, zip.

16
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,748
No.

17
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,870
Betty?

18
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,554
There's a parrot in there.

19
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,150
I got fired by a parrot.
Wow, that's wonderful.

20
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,672
I didn't know the old man had
a sense of humour. Where is he?

21
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,150
He's gone during reorganization.

22
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,359
- Reorganization?
- We'll miss you, Mr. Quinelle.

23
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,396
Your final check.
You can use the company car...

24
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,676
...until the end of the month.

25
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,959
Come on, a bird can't fire me,
I'm upper management.

26
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,630
They can't fire me.
Yes, he can.

27
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,474
Could you get him on the phone?

28
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,315
- I'm not to bother him.
- Get him on the phone.

29
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,028
- I can't.
- Get him on the phone, Betty.

30
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,840
I've worked here eight years...

31
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,592
- Don't make me use it.
- You're overreacting.

32
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,991
I'm sick of everyone griping.
No one cares...

33
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,073
...how Mr. Stoddard feels.
- How does he feel?

34
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,039
- He's got an ulcer.
- I'd be upset too.

35
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,192
Each person he fires
is a nail in his coffin.

36
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,876
You don't how hard he worked
to teach the bird.

37
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,475
Why not have it
take a dump on me?

38
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,871
You'd rather get a cold,
inhuman printout?

39
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,672
I hope you don't mind me saying this,
but you're an ungrateful turd.

40
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,559
Twelve years of doing business
doesn't mean anything?

41
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,196
You can close me up, just like that?

42
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,956
You're not closing me up.
You're just cutting deliveries.

43
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,631
I'm a gas station. What will my
customers do? Push their cars in?

44
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,158
I know all about free enterprise
and the American way.

45
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,999
I fought a war for all that.

46
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,233
What war? The big one: Korea.
Well, it was big to me.

47
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,558
They put you on hold as
soon as they don't want you.

48
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,720
Hello? Hello?

49
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,352
Excuse me, it's my first time here.
Where do you get a blue card?

50
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,669
Blue car?

51
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,910
- Card.
- Card.

52
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,115
Yes, sir.

53
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,471
My green card I leave
in my other pants.

54
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,032
You don't speak...
I'd better help you, I think...

55
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,752
I love America.

56
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,714
Isn't it?
Thank you. Thank you.

57
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,556
Excuse me, I just have one question.
Do you mind if I hop in line?

58
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,197
No. Do you mind if I bite off
your nose and stick it up your ass?

59
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,439
I have told you, Mr. Paluso,
why you're not eligible.

60
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,558
I paid into unemployment...

61
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,833
...for the 12 years that I owned
the station. So I...

62
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,551
An owner cannot be unemployed.
Only an employee can be unemployed.

63
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,950
I do not make the rules.

64
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,159
Since I paid that money and
nobody's collected, why...?

65
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,030
I'm terribly, terribly, terribly,
unable to help you.

66
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,152
Who else can I talk to?
Your supervisor or the assistant?

67
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,154
You may get a form in line " C"
and take it to window " F"...

68
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,951
I won't stand in any more lines.
I've stood on line since 8 a. m.

69
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,351
Six hours it took me
just to see you.

70
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,229
I'll sit here until someone
who can help me shows up.

71
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,996
- I ask you politely to leave.
- You can't treat people like cattle.

72
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,673
Excuse me.

73
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,309
- For the last time, leave.
- No.

74
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,876
I'm not going until I get
a logical answer.

75
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,157
What the hell? Jesus! Goddamn it!

76
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,349
Next.

77
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,949
More coffee, hon?

78
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,553
Alrighty.

79
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,437
Could you cut that out
or go someplace else?

80
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,829
Excuse me?

81
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,993
The moaning, the noises.
The moaning noises you're making.

82
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,593
It's getting to me.

83
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,197
I don't know who you hear moaning,
pal, but I don't moan.

84
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,396
Must have been somebody else.

85
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,915
- I'm not a moaner.
- Forget it.

86
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,678
Yeah.

87
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,149
It wasn't a moan.
I was just clearing my throat.

88
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,154
I was just, I was...
A person can clear his throat.

89
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,839
I'm not the most sensitive guy,
but I can see you've got some trouble.

90
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,878
It would help you
to unload it on somebody.

91
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,910
So if you want to talk,
go someplace else, okay?

92
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,274
Check.

93
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,159
What's wrong with people
in the world?

94
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,951
Today, the head of a major corporation
had a parrot fire me.

95
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,760
A woman I know pulled a gun on me.

96
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,554
And another woman I don't even know...

97
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,554
...threatened to bite off my nose
and stick it up my ass.

98
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,155
Now I'm accused of moaning.

99
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,069
All right, everybody freeze.
Everybody! Everybody!

100
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,436
Don't be jiving with my ass.

101
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,955
Y'all, get out of the booth. Now!

102
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,668
You, get off the table. Get up here.

103
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,957
What's wrong with you,
you honky mother?

104
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,590
Get the lead out of your ass
and get up here.

105
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,149
Whoa, where was you going?

106
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,951
Think you're going to the police?
No, you take your clothes off.

107
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,159
Everybody, get your clothes off.
Get your clothes off.

108
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,793
Get out here and get them clothes off.
Get on out there and get to shucking.

109
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,395
Shit, you ain't got no money.

110
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,555
What did they pay you in, food stamps?
You should be robbing me.

111
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,197
You're slower than molasses.
I told you get them clothes off.

112
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,592
I promise I won't chase you,
just let me keep my pants on.

113
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,150
I'll be a rock,
standing here with my pants on.

114
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,549
With the what?

115
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,194
Let me talk to you. Let me talk.

116
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,032
Well, do it, man. What?

117
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,159
I'm a divorced man,
and I let the laundry pile up.

118
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,148
- So I'm not wearing any underwear.
- I don't care!

119
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,749
Just get your honky ass undressed.

120
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,949
Please, give the guy a break.
He's not wearing any underwear.

121
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,153
- Some people aren't gifted.
- Shut your damn mouth.

122
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,676
Okay, I'll take it off.
Don't get so excited.

123
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,592
Get at it! Come on.

124
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,991
I won't watch this man dangle
for your delight.

125
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,358
You can take our wallets,
but you can't take our dignity.

126
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,036
I'll tell you what.
While your britches are down...

127
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,239
...why don't you bend over
and kiss your ass goodbye!

128
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,755
You hear that? Let it go!

129
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,793
Let go of my damn gun.
I'm gonna blow your ass off.

130
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,877
Look what you've done.

131
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,311
I've been shot.

132
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,670
I'm bleeding, aren't I?
Oh, that's a major gash.

133
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,354
I couldn't die in a good restaurant.

134
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,154
No, my last meal had to be a chilidog.

135
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,554
You won't die.

136
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,151
They always say that to people
who are dying, don't they?

137
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,876
Did you see the gunman?
Did you see what he looked like?

138
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,190
He looked familiar.

139
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,317
You look familiar too.

140
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,076
You I've never seen.

141
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,870
I never thought I'd be engaged
to a man with a bullet wound.

142
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,193
I think it's very '80s...

143
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,194
...very sexy in a way.

144
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,592
I'll live. Press that button.
I have a surprise for you.

145
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,559
- What button?
- That one right there.

146
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,876
- Whoa, watch out.
- Donald...

147
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,678
- Look: Up scope.
- Okay.

148
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,957
Look, Mr. Weasel rising from the dead.

149
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,357
- Donald. Donald!
- What? Sonny.

150
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,199
- I don't want to break up your fun.
- Are you kidding? Come on in here.

151
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,956
Sonny Paluso, I'd like you to meet
my wife to be, Doreen Ryan.

152
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,870
- Honey, Sonny.
- What you did was really brave.

153
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,157
It was one of those crazy things.

154
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,477
I just came by to see
how you were feeling.

155
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,280
Besides the ventilation, fine.

156
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,352
I came by to apologize.
If not for me, you wouldn't be shot.

157
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,790
- Come on.
- You wouldn't be here.

158
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,759
- I mean it...
- I do too.

159
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,031
Sometimes you need some sense
knocked into you. Some mondo reality.

160
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,432
We spend so much time pursuing
that almighty dollar...

161
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,558
...that we can forget
what matters most.

162
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,712
Like people you love. Health.

163
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,755
God.

164
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,157
Those are three of the big ones,
all right.

165
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,754
When they brought me in here,
I lost a lot of blood.

166
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,753
You'll think I'm in bozo city, but...

167
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,592
No, go ahead. What?

168
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,755
As I felt my life ebbing away,
just for an instant...

169
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,153
...I saw God's face.

170
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,349
- You wanna know what God looks like?
- Who wouldn't?

171
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,599
I couldn't make it out too clearly,
because there was...

172
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,592
...this bright glow.

173
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,559
He had this white cloud
all around him.

174
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,389
Finally I could make out a head.
He has a large head.

175
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,154
Sure, he's God.

176
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,275
Then finally the cloud disappeared...

177
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,988
...and I heard this voice say...

178
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,755
Holy shit! Jeez, that's us.

He hardly ever acts like this.

195
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,994

Good evening, baby.

207
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,431
Hi, Poppy. How'd it go? Did you
find a new place for the station?

208
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,750
No, not yet.

It shouldn't be too hard
to rebuild the old one.

210
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,754
I didn't exactly tell you the truth
about my relocating, Candice.

211
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,235
I didn't want you to worry.

212
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,156
- It worked. I wasn't worried at all.
- You're old enough for the truth.

213
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,229
Just remember that things
always happen for the best, okay?

214
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,959
Now I'm worried.

215
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,470
I didn't say anything for you
to be worried about.

216

So what's the terrific news this time?

219
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,750
Well, the truth of it is that...

What's this? PBS?

221
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,516

You don't want to kill me.

275
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,596
No, not particularly.
I hadn't planned to kill you.

276
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,753
But your friend on TV
was running his big mouth...

277
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,954
...turning this into a circus. That
pressures the cops to get involved.

278
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:46,154
You two I.D. me, the police arrest me,
stick a fork in my ass, and I'm done.

279
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,878
I told him not to go on TV.
Think you were upset? I was upset.

280
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,557
I called him immediately.
I told him he was no friend of mine.

281
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,430
I hire this out
to kill people, right?

282
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,151
And I'm responsible for a lot
of big murders. Unsolved murders.

283
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,592
Remember a certain labour leader

284
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,353
Jimmy Hoffa?

285
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,278
I'm not bragging,
but I had a good living...

286
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,479
...until the economy
went in the toilet.

287
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,679
Everybody wants to bargain,
even the rich dudes.

288
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,993
They want me to give them a deal,
but I don't make deals.

289
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,958
I know what you mean.

290
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,232
I was raised a very strict
southern Baptist.

291
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,153
I place a high value on human life:

292
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,994
$20,000 minimum.

293
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,958
It's very fair.

294
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,119
You think I wasn't embarrassed
stooping to armed robbery?

295
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,073
Using that phony accent in that café?

296
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,355
I've never been called
a " honky mo'fo" before.

297
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,872
I had to be somebody, and we blame
everything on blacks anyway.

298
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,553
- Sure.
- So I'm a putz.

299
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,756
A putz?

300
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,558
When I told you I wasn't
wearing underwear...

301
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,839
...and you pointed that gun at me,
I felt like a putz too.

302
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,154
You didn't want to strip, eh?
The place was too crowded, wasn't it?

303
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,953
I better get home. If I'm gone
long, the old lady gets mad.

304
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,035
- You want some coffee before you go?
- No, that caffeine makes me quick.

305
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:32,149
If you don't mind, I would like to use
your pillow. Muffle the gunshot.

306
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,751
- You're still gonna kill me?
- It's business, and I got a family.

307
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,788
I got a family too.

308
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,191
Their pictures are on the wall.

309
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,352
- Is that your daughter?
- Yeah.

310
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,551
Looks like my oldest daughter.

311
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,557
She's a very sweet girl.

312
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,997
Hey, is that who I think that is?

313
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,791
- Is that Trini Lopez there?
- That's right, that's Trini.

314
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,190
That's me and his chauffeur.

315
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,557
They came in for gasoline
and new wipers.

316
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,078
" Lemon Tree. " Remember that?
He made a record of that song.

317
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,359
- Yeah, the record.
- What's that Spanish writing there?

318
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,878
<i>"Gasolina. "
Or "Gracias por la gasolina. "</i>

319
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,033
<i>What does gracias...?
"Thanks for pouring the gas. "</i>

320
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,794
- That's it.
- Writes funny, don't it?

321
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,598
Yes.

322
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,477
Back to business.

323
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,557
- Who is it?
- I don't know, I swear to God.

324
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,870
- I don't know.
- Come on, move.

325
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,236
I don't know who that is.

326
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,358
I'm coming, I'm coming.

327
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,958
Okay, okay, I'm coming.

328
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,957
- Is Sonny here?
- You're the guy from the news.

329
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,549
- Yes, I'm Don Quinelle.
- Hi, come in.

330
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,389
- He's upstairs.
- He must have seen me on the news...

331
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,950
...he left a message
on my machine with carnal verbs.

332
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,156
He's awake. I heard him stir.
If I could see him...

333
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,875
Don't! I woke him up before,
and he got really mad.

334
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,159
Could you wake him again?
Just tell him I'm here.

335
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,630
No way, no way.

336
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,552
I'll give you a dollar.

337
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,553
Dad!

338
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,992
Why aren't you in bed?

339
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,829
- Get him in here.
- I can't.

340
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,877
I said, get him in here.

341
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,796
I can't do that. He's an idiot,
but I can't double-cross him.

342
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,474
- Shut up. Be quiet.
- I won't do it.

343
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,439
No, don't bother. I've got to go.

344
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,478
Don't bother waking him.
I better be going.

345
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,156
I'll get back to him
tomorrow, okay? Bye-bye.

346
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,394
He's gone.

347
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,356
I didn't hear a door slam.

348
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,549
Forgot my hat.

349
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,674
Bye.

350
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,758
All right.

351
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,438
Move. Move.

352
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,393
Oh, God.

353
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,357
You creamed that sucker.

354
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,229
I did, didn't I?
I didn't know I had that in me.

355
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,473
I saw my life flash before me.
You really hit him hard.

356
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,996
I thought it was him,
I was right there...

357
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,277
...and I heard the voice.

358
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,150
Then I heard that " keep quiet. "
I ran down, and all of a sudden...

359
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,154
...then he goes, he says...
I'm sorry.

360
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,359
I don't know, it's strange
and then, and then...

361
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,395
I got this. Then I ran upstairs,
I got... You came out.

362
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,189
I almost got you.
Then you came out and then, wham!

363
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,398
And then I just... Wham!

364
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,473
Then he dropped
like a sack of potatoes.

365
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,998
I got this. I guess I improvised.
I didn't know I had it in me.

366
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,755
The thing that makes me
grab things, hurt things.

367
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,428
I'm babbling now.

368
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,831
He's not dead, is he?

369
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,550
I didn't hit him hard,
I'm not covered for that.

370
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,193
He's okay, he moved.

371
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,158
- He's waking.
- Thank God.

372
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,954
Maybe you better hit him again.

373
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,191
Oh, you hit him.

374
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,752
No, I can't hit him. You hit him.
You have the technique down.

375
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,037
- I already hit him.
- Just a little tap.

376
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,310
- I got this.
- Jeez.

377
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,358
I'll keep him cops,
you call the cover.

378
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,194
There we go, that's fine.

379
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,874
He's moving. Don't mess with me.

380
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,078
- Leave it to the police.
- You're history.

381
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,390
<i>- Police Department.
- We have...</i>

382
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,790
<i>All our personnel are busy...</i>

383
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,749
<i>...but stay on the line
for the first available officer.</i>

384
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,952
Come on. Hey, hey, hey.

385
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,035
Wait, wait, wait!

386
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,556
Be careful or someone will get hurt.

387
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,874
Come on, come on.

388
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,438
I'm fine, I'm fine.

389
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,752
Look, the neighbours are waking up.

390
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,437
You're going to jail, pal.
Then you'll get my dry cleaning bill.

391
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,830
I'm fine. Everything's cool.

392
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,640
- You hurt?
- No, but that tree's dead.

393
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,355
- Don't know much about guns, do you?
- I'm handling it.

394
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,797
- I wish you'd put the safety on.
- Do you, now?

395
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,678
- I really would.
- I bet.

396
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,878
- It's right on the...
- Put your hand down.

397
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,148
Don't try that trick. Think you're
Mr. Smart? Now you met Mr. Smarter.

398
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,833
Donald, would you please
put the safety on?

399
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,153
In case we stop suddenly
or hit a bump or something.

400
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,834
Okay, Sonny. Yeah, right, right.

401
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,032
Could you point the gun
in a safe direction?

402
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,272
Donald, for everyone's sake,
will you do it?

403
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,272
Yeah. I am, I am.

404
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,555
- In front...
- Back on your hands.

405
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:31,390
- Excuse me.
- Good. Back in same direction.

406
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,634
In front of that hammer,
on the left side, is a lever.

407
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,795
- See? Push it up. Right thumb.
- Great. Now what?

408
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,951
Now the gun is on safe.

409
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,158
- Excuse me.
- Sit down.

410
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,277
- We have a man...
- Sit down.

411
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,033
Okay.

412
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,555
- We'll have to wait.
- Come on.

413
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,072
- I hate to put you guys through...
- I've just been accosted.

414
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,799
We were here first.

415
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,395
- I was accosted.
- In this century?

416
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,270
- Let the lady talk, will you?
- Everybody calm down, okay?

417
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,192
What's wrong, ma'am?

418
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,399
I was on my way home
from my friend Alice's apartment.

419
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:36,760
She's making a sweater for her son.
He's a big attorney in Denver.

420
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,032
- Cut the crap and get to the point.
- Stop it.

421
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,555
As I passed the 7-Eleven...

422
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,354
...they shouted nasty insults at me.

423
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,632
I'm not talking pee-pee ca-ca,
I'm talking...

424
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,916
He's got a gun!

425
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,600
I believe you got
everybody's attention.

426
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,758
Drop the gun.

427
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,277
I'm not a criminal. He is.
We brought him here.

428
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,590
We don't wanna make trouble.

429
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,997
- Put it down, scumbag.
- Get rid of it.

430
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,993
My name's Donald Quinelle.

431
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,152
The irony is, this isn't even my...

432
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,953
- Wait, you're the guy on the news?
- Yes.

433
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,758
Let him go.

434
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,393
You've violated my rights
and integrity.

435
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,632
Whiplash, asphyxiation.
Nice double lawsuit.

436
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,796
Don't wave guns around.

437
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,829
- That's not my gun. It's his.
- That's true.

438
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,271
Actually the gun
belonged to my father.

439
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,157
He was killed carrying that weapon
on Iwo Jima.

440
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:50,356
He threw himself on a grenade.
His commander sent it to me.

441
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,398
It's all I have to remember him by.

442
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,189
Tell him how Lee gave
granny a mule at Gettysburg.

443
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,559
He's slicker than
whale shit on ice.

444
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,718
You're looking for him. Look at him.

445
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,354
<i>He has a face from
the road company in Deliverance.</i>

446
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,553
- What did he do?
- Tell young Kojak what he did.

447
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,750
Actually he's the gentleman who...

448
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,551
...robbed the diner.

449
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,157
He killed Hoffa.
Did the fact escape you?

450
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,789
Maybe he was just talking.
Let's go.

451
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:36,079
He said, "What did he do?"
You said, " He robbed a diner. "

452
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,153
Like Attila the Hun just
conquered Europe.

453
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,794
He wanted to kill you.
He could have.

454
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,873
You become a doorstop
for a guy named Vinnie.

455
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,557
We're still alive, aren't we?
The computer will discover who he is.

456
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,874
When he's out of jail, he won't hold
a grudge. He'll kill the computer.

457
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,997
I should have shot him.

458
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,791
The police. " Drop the gun, scumbag. "
That pissed me off.

459
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,759
I may be an asshole,
but not a scumbag.

460
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,909
You're right. I'm overreacting.
Sorry. Oh, God!

461
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:25,151
You know something?
I really miss that gun.

462
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,798
- I've had it with guns for one night.
- Yeah. Boy.

463
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,348
- Can we stop?
- Forgot what guns look like?

464
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,990
We'll browse. A few minutes.
Please.

465
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,550
- No.
- All right. I'll go in alone.

466
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,873
- When the light changes, I'm leaving.
- I'll take a cab.

467
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,391
If you're not out in 10 minutes,
I'll be gone.

468
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,949
Bless you, Sonny.

469
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:12,992
It's gonna happen.
Society will bite the big one.

470
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,796
When the going gets
tough, the tough get going.

471
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,349
Smart money heads for the hills.

472
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,952
I wanna see what happens
when society bites the big one.

473
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,748
- Can I see a magazine?
- Sure.

474
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,636
The fee can apply toward the down
payment on a Survival Hideaway.

475
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,716
- A.44 magnum.
- Can I hold it?

476
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,793
- That one?
- Fits in the small of the back.

477
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,158
- So I could come up behind someone.
- Well, it...

478
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,595
- Come on.
- I'm just looking.

479
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,475
- Look fast.
- You got it.

480
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,359
- Can I see one of those? Thanks.
- Yes.

481
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,399
- Aboriginal.
- I beg your pardon.

482
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,758
- The obsession people have for guns.
- Just like the cowboys.

483
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,069
- How about that?
- Aim it right down the barrel.

484
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,199
- Can I get a shoulder holster?
- A shoulder holster?

485
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,753
Right here. You see
how I got that, huh?

486
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,795
- You don't want a more compact...?
- That wouldn't kill a flea.

487
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,270
If you saw this you'd run.

488
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,278
- I want one.
- No you don't.

489
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,549
- Yes.
- No.

490
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,075
I have wonderful luck with my mace.

491
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,197
- Think you'd like it?
- Yes.

492
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,512
- Can we go together on a refill?
- Thanks...

493
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,154
...but I'm allergic to mace.

494
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,953
Quite a weapon.

495
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,109
Just looking.

496
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,995
- Donald?
- Hon, I'll be right in.

497
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,357
Don't you worry. I'll be right there.

498
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,191
- Where were you?
- What?

499
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,991
- What time is it?
- It's late, little buttercup.

500
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,352
You go right back to bed.
I'll be right there. Come on now.

501
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,189
You know I can't fall asleep
again once I wake up.

502
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,951
- Not unless we snuggle.
- No, no.

503
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,598
Something's poking me.

504
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,991
It's the best I can do
on short notice.

505
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,550
Something's under here.

506
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,758
Make a wish.

507
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,352
What is that?

508
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,354
Looks like an assault rifle.
Semi-automatic. 308 caliber with...

509
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,670
...a folding stock.

510
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,150
I was gonna show you at breakfast.
You spoiled my surprise.

511
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,630
I've seen that look. You're mad at me.

512
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,751
I'm not mad at you.

513
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,998
Really? You're gonna love
these other goodies I got.

514
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,359
A little detachable bayonet. Look.
Hey. Self-cleaning too.

515
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,551
That's nice. It won't rust.

516
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,396
I got one for you.
It's called a " Fem-Prod"...

517
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,757
...or the " Little Squealer. "
Kind of nice...

518
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,753
...designer thing,
goes with any outfit.

519
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,751
I got another one here.

520
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,788
This is a concussion grenade.

521
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,793
That would break up any party.

522
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,991
These are little designer weapons.
Chinese throwing stars.

523
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,074
Put them as buttons and
if someone messes with you...

524
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,955
I got two extra clips.
These are fun. Look at that.

525
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,755
This is for a medium load,
and this is for a large.

526
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,877
Fifty shots.

527
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,596
This is it. He threw this
in for free. Look.

528
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,555
Looks like a belt buckle, doesn't it?
But, okay. Surprise!

529
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,795
- Now you're mad at me.
- I'm not mad at you.

530
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,355
You've been under pressure.

531
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,036
I know that pressure can make
people do crazy...

532
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,550
...and impulsive things.

533
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,110
No, I bought these things for us.

534
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,154
For you too.
What if someone broke in?

535
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,631
What will you do?
Stun him with good taste?

536
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,993
I bought them because there's a need.

537
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,677
The world's coming undone like a cheap
suit. We have to be ready.

538
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,878
This may be impulsive,
but it's not crazy.

539
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:56,352
Maybe we should get some rest
and talk about this tomorrow.

540
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,875
You should read this first.

541
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,596
"Give me two weeks,
I'll give you a future. "

542
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,757
I've enrolled us in this.

543
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,470
I want us to go to Vermont
for a few weeks.

544
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,996
- We may stay if we like it.
- You serious?

545
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,992
Yes, very much so.

546
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,949
Times are changing
and not for the better.

547
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,437
I never thought I'd consider
marrying a man with an automatic gun.

548
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,877
Semi-automatic.
Automatics are illegal.

549
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,910
- Why are you saying "consider"?
- I just mean, Donald...

550
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,957
...you seem so different.
- Whizzer...

551
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,676
...I'm no different, I'm just armed.
Survival training will be fun.

552
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,758
Like skiing,
except for booby traps.

553
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,869
I don't believe in surviving.
I believe in living.

554
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,996
Come on, take a chance.

555
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:01,996
I'm not gonna go.
If you want to go, you can.

556
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,357
But, I won't be here
when you get back.

557
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,749
Yes, you will.
You'll love me more when I'm back.

558
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,117
You'll remember I was a wimp
and love me more...

559
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,956
...because I'll be a real man.
- I love who you are now.

560
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,877
Or at least who I thought you were.

561
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,759
Don't...

562
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,950
I'm on my way. Got my gear. I'm
giving you one last chance to come.

563
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,550
You can give me
pointers when you get back.

564
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,872
Depending how things go,
I might not come back.

565
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,516
I may buy a survival condo
and stay indefinitely.

566
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,876
Indefinitely?

567
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,950
In case you want to visit,
here's the address and directions.

568
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,159
- There are no phones. You can't call.
- We'll write.

569
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,909
We'll tie messages on birds.

570
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,352
You look at me like
the lights are on, but nobody's home.

571
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,592
A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

572
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,753
- I've never had a friend like you.
- Same here.

573
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,752
- Take care of yourself.
- You too, kid.

574
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,950
I get 47%
of the meter drop plus tips, right?

575
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,355
<i>Car 89, your fare will
be in front of the address.</i>

576
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,877
Looks like we gonna have us
a little rain.

577
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,231
Keeps up, this damp weather.
What do you think?

578
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,113
Let's go.

579
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,272
Take a right.

580
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,909
You escape?

581
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,759
- I made bail.
- They let you out.

582
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,552
They had me for attempted robbery,
and the computer didn't work.

583
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,076
So here we are.

584
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,037
You, temporarily.

585
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,716
- Take it right... Turn right here.
- Where?

586
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,550
At the next street.
Are you gonna start that shit again?

587
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,153
- Wait a second.
- You wait a second.

588
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,756
Hands in your pockets.

589
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,198
The police didn't link you
to the murders so nobody knows.

590
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,671
You know who I am.
Your friend knows.

591
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,550
I didn't say anything before, did I?
I could have told them.

592
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,550
I appreciate that. I don't know if
your friend's biscuits are done.

593
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,995
You give up on killing us...

594
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,150
...and we won't say anything
about your killing...

595
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,873
You see? I already forgot his name.

596
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:44,159
- Why don't we talk to him?
- He's out of town. Maybe indefinitely.

597
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,352
- Let's call him.
- There's no phone there.

598
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,996
- Can't talk to him, can't phone...
- Tell you what.

599
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,800
I have his address.
I'll give it to you.

600
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,600
Get away from the car. Come here.

601
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,595
I'll make you a deal. If I haven't
heard from him in a week...

602
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:10,556
...you'll be the deadest sons of
bitches God strung a gut through.

603
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,555
Now, my phone number is 555-1727.

604
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,960
And don't call before 9 a. m.

605
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,269
- I'll take your car. You don't mind?
- My pleasure.

606
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,750
You remember that number.

607
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,753
Look.

608
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,679
Hello. We're looking for somebody.

609
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,309
But we could look someplace else.

610
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:42,519
I knew you'd change your mind.

611
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,353
I feel like a bear's gynaecologist.

612
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:52,154
- Hope you like scrambled eggs.
- I didn't know you cooked.

613
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,989
- I whip up something now and then.
- What else?

614
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,794
Powdered coffee, powdered pancakes,
powdered bacon.

615
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,951
You could snort breakfast.

616
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,988
I have. Here we go. There.

617
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,959
You get the hang of it real soon.

618
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,391
- Are those done?
- You bet.

619
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,551
What brings you here, huh?

620
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,798
You're probably fleeing
the Big Cesspool.

621
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,190
That's what Wes calls New York.

622
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:24,592
Kind of a play on words.
The Big Apple. The Big Cesspool.

623
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:29,152
- He's a witty guy.
- I can't wait for you to meet him.

624
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,796
- Why are you really here?
- Excuse us, sweetheart.

625
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,319
- Do I have to?
- Yes, go watch TV.

626
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,590
- No TV.
- How do you exist?

627
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:44,356
Go read a magazine. Look outside.
Listen to your headphones.

628
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,998
Watch for migrating geese.
You didn't take your breakfast.

629
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,549
Feed it to the migrating geese.

630
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,555
If the heat stays on,
the eggs turn back to powder.

631
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,276
Saw Jack the other night.
He's out on bail.

632
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,559
The only people worse
than lawbreakers are lawmakers.

633
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,276
I made a deal with him.
Stop cooking and listen to me.

634
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,956
I made a deal with Jack.
We reveal nothing...

635
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,039
...and he, in turn, leaves us alone.

636
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,598
But he wants to hear it from your lips.

637
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,753
That you go along. What do you say?

638
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,069
Let's go.

639
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,793
Go get change in case this runs
over three minutes.

640
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,191
I don't think Jack
really wanted to kill us.

641
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,829
I think he's a decent human being.

642
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,358
Jack, it's Sonny Paluso.

643
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,557
It's ten of nine.

644
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:54,590
I'm sorry you did and I forgot.
I'll call you back after 9.

645
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:59,994
Please excuse... You sure?
It's okay? I don't mind calling you...

646
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:05,432
He's right here. He's anxious
to talk to you. Thank you.

647
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:14,032
Hello. Yes, this is Donald Quinelle.

648
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,356
Yes, Sonny told me.

649
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,872
What do I think?

650
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:38,669
I'll tell anyone
whatever I want, whenever I want.

651
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,354
I don't wanna hear
what you want.

652
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,355
You'd be the one
knowing your mother like that.

653
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,751
You don't scare me.

654
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,276
Matter of fact, you amuse me.

655
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,354
When I see you, I'll try
not to laugh in your inbred face.

656
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,558
My ass is here
if you wanna whup it.

657
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,957
Just come try and
I'll blow you away like lint.

658
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,351
I'll give you directions, dipshit.

659
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:16,718
Yes indeed, can you write?

660
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,549
Is anyone there with
an education past first grade?

661
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,515
You just take highway 16.

662
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,793
Yes, that's one and
then five numbers after it.

663
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:31,350
You drive fast, oyster-brain.
Yes, indeed.

664
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,951
Once you're here, there will be
one less wart on society's ass.

665
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,070
Yeah, fuck you too. Bye-bye.

666
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,235
- Feel better?
- He'll be here tomorrow.

667
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,796
What a relief. Thanks.

668
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:58,273
No, thank you. God, think of it.
It'll be like my final exam.

669
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,192
Going mano a mano with
only the victor left.

670
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,235
Mano a mano? What did you say to him?

671
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,951
You leaving again?

672
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,070
- Is she young?
- Who?

673
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:33,071
We've been married too long to play
these games. You'd leave, I never ask.

674
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:38,394
- I wish you wouldn't start that.
- You went away for weeks.

675
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,073
Will you ever trust me?

676
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:44,552
I don't care if she's a stewardess.
But if you're in love...

677
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:50,194
After 17 years,
you know I don't love anyone else.

678
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:54,275
Why the trips?
The phone calls that make you leave.

679
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,356
- I lie awake, picturing you with her.
- You wanna know?

680
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,753
You really wanna know?
I'm a professional killer.

681
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,470
- Come on.
- That's right.

682
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,154
Wanna know where I've been lately?

683
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,758
I've been in jail.

684
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,156
Wanna know where I'm going?

685
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,756
I'm going to kill two people.

686
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,158
Wanna know why?

687
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,552
Very simple.

688
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:40,149
These men can finger me
for the death of Jimmy Hoffa.

689
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:44,157
Then I'll spend my life in jail.

690
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,629
I can't have that shit.

691
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,752
So I'm not out there
committing adultery.

692
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,474
I'm out committing murder.

693
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,558
Thank God.

694
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:11,995
It wasn't like I asked you to do
anything difficult. A phone call.

695
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,118
- Are you done?
- He's a professional killer.

696
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,397
- Me too.
- You're a shit disturber.

697
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,952
I don't believe you actually called
him a clam-brain.

698
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,559
Oyster-brain.

699
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,679
There are people living normal lives,
why can't I be one?

700
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:35,357
Why did I end up with a nut
dressed like an Eskimo terrorist?

701
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:38,552
- Now you attack my clothes.
- What will we do?

702
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:43,151
We'll fight and we'll win.
We'll walk tall and fear no man.

703
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,709
No, really, what will we do?

704
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,076
- Wanna meet someone to help you relax?
- Desperately.

705
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,151
Take a right, up there.

706
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,391
Stay close.
They're using live ammo today.

707
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,154
I'd hate to die before he gets here.

708
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,198
I'd hate to get killed anytime.

709
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:11,355
If you get killed, you can't
party or anything. It would be a drag.

710
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,949
Shoot the radios. Without music,
they lose half their will.

711
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,673
You won't find any arrowheads
down there.

712
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,996
We each have a dog sled team.
They go anywhere.

713
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,357
If it's cold,
you can sleep with the dogs.

714
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,551
Platonically, of course.

715
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,877
- What does that mean?
- Means he's no dog lover.

716
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,588
- Wes once ate a dog.
- On purpose?

717
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,354
Yes. He was stranded without food.

718
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:51,794
Good thing it tasted like squirrel.
Too bad it was his fastest dog.

719
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,359
Not fast enough.

720
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,994
Wes changed my life.
Now I control my environment...

721
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:03,109
...instead of it controlling me.
If I had to, I could kill.

722
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,878
I took an aerobic class.
It didn't cost $5000 or anything...

723
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:12,079
...but if I had to,
I could jump and land in a split.

724
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,958
You die!

725
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,952
Sorry, Bob, too early. You seen Wes?

726
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,356
Greetings, gentlemen.

727
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,795
Welcome to the new middle ages.

728
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,396
There will be violence,
destruction and savagery...

729
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,750
...never dreamed of.

730
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,276
But, if you are prepared...

731
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,876
...this will be a time to treasure.

732
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,311
For all of you.

733
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:43,553
You are the kings of the future.

734
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:48,991
Did you pass...? Did you pass out
the Supply Survivor Catalogues?

735
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,673
Hideaway brochures?

736
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:54,356
I wasn't supposed to
till you finished your speech.

737
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:59,475
I finished the " kings of the future"
speech. Look alive. Come on.

738
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,952
Please turn to page three of your
Supply Survival Catalogue.

739
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:14,399
When the end comes, there won't be
supermarkets. No drugstores.

740
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,355
There will always be mail order.

741
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,358
And this is your life line.

742
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:25,549
The two-dollar fee will be refunded
on your first purchase of over $50.

743
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,597
This sounds stupid, but...

744
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:32,992
...won't you get bored out here
if society doesn't collapse?

745
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:37,358
Wes says, society's heading
for the big flush...

746
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:41,189
...we'll be clinging to the rim
while everything falls.

747
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,557
- What if things improve?
- Is the air?

748
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,797
- True.
- The economy? The Middle East?

749
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,873
Arts? Literature?
Television? Presidents?

750
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,394
Anyone can nitpick.

751
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,349
Name one thing that's improved
the last decade.

752
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,828
- See.
- Video games.

753
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:06,398
- Video games. There you are.
- All right. I acknowledge that.

754
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,870
But society will deteriorate.

755
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,274
But hiding up here in the hills,
it seems so un-American.

756
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,317
We won't stay forever.

757
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,593
When the shit hits the fan,
pardon me, we'll come take over.

758
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:23,799
Now you can't get any more American
than that, can you?

759
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,679
See that attaché case that man has?

760
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:32,074
In that case are Wes' plans
for the restructuring of society.

761
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:35,750
Boy. Think about that.
A whole new society.

762
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,519
We'll be part of it.

763
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:41,156
- It makes your sphincter tingle.
- Sphincter tingle?

764
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,995
- Those words didn't come to mind.
- Let's tell Wes.

765
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,958
- Wait...
- We gotta...

766
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,550
...so everyone can prepare.
It'll be a homecoming.

767
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,435
- We'll make something special.
- Maybe we shouldn't.

768
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,552
Maybe we should keep this between us.

769
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,353
You know, mano a mano?

770
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:03,639
- Wes will want a mano in there too.
- That will spoil it.

771
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,549
- That's how John Wayne would do it.
- Damn straight.

772
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,352
Fucking-A. Pardon me.

773
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,550
Let's go meet Wes now.
I think we'll do that...

774
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,554
...but let's go see Wes now.
- I'll tell you what.

775
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:22,038
We get up early tomorrow,
meet Wes, maybe take a walk...

776
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,312
...then we finish Jack off
and grab dinner.

777
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,358
- Make a day of it.
- Yes.

778
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,828
Fantastic.

779
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:34,074
Does this make you realize
that men have nipples too?

780
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,588
- Wes said other things...
- Nipples?

781
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:51,354
Hello, Jack. How have you been?

782
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,748
Sure, we can talk. Talk this!

783
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,588
I admire a man who can
go one on one with me, because...

784
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,071
Oh, you cheat! Oh, my leg!

785
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:18,199
Too bad you're wearing a Teflon vest.
I guess you got me. Not really!

786
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:22,753
Now for the mercy kill.
Ciao, baby.

787
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,110
- Hey.
- Pardon me?

788
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:30,353
- Let's get out of here. Let's pack.
- Hey, pack this.

789
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:37,997
You're gonna force me to do
something I didn't wanna do.

790
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,549
What's that, old man?

791
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:49,035
- I'm a master of hand-to-hand combat.
- Oh, well...

792
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,670
Sorry, now you're packed.

793
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,954
Quick. Let's get him out of sight.

794
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,549
Faster, Wiley, faster!

795
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,393
Knock it off.

796
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,395
- Hi.
- Don around?

797
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,953
- He's out.
- Totally.

798
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,993
- Friend of his?
- Yes, I'm Sonny Paluso.

799
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,151
This is my daughter.

800
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:50,439
- Such lovely skin.
- Her skin is only 16 years old.

801
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,269
I've some business with Don.
I'll see him at class.

802
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,472
- We won't be here.
- Candice and I won't.

803
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:03,628
We dropped by for today.
We're going to the Big Cesspool.

804
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:08,875
I'm afraid not. I've closed the area.
No way in or out till dawn.

805
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:13,676
- Good. We'll sleep well knowing that.
- Doreen.

806
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,838
- Have a nice night.
- Thank you. You too.

807
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:21,148
Here, Lucky, here, boy. Mush!

808
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,513
<i>WXIW weather.
Intermittent snow flurries.</i>

809
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,871
Okay. Now, let's do it once more.

810
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:41,556
What are you gonna say to Jack
when he comes?

811
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,676
I'm gonna say:

812
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,670
" I go along with the deal. "

813
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,838
And then I say,
"What happened before...

814
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,150
...is between him and the police. "

815
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,311
That's nice.

816
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,434
Then I'll say, " I'm sorry...

817
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:04,229
...but I have to blow a hole
in your skeevy heart. "

818
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,313
"Skeevy heart"?

819
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,635
Yeah.

820
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,517
- An expression you learned from Wes?
- Yes.

821
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:16,508
Wes says meet an attack
with a vicious counterattack.

822
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,632
If I don't get sleep,
I won't be vicious.

823
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,675
And to you Wes is a god?

824
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:28,035
No. Just an ordinary man.
Ahead of his time, but just a man.

825
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,754
- Wes is an asshole.
- Blasphemy!

826
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,639
You'll smoke a turd in hell
for that!

827
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,558
Wes says your gun is your friend.

828
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:41,554
- Yes, I love my gun.
- Well, here is your gun.

829
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,712
Show me how you'll use it
when Jack gets here.

830
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,632
Give it to me.

831
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:54,039
Maybe you'd like to use
your friend, the knife.

832
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,512
Shit!

833
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,232
Perhaps when Jack comes in you'd
prefer to make him pancakes.

834
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,759
No! No!

835
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,638
Yes.

836
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:10,437
This is a lot like how
I gave up smoking.

837
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,279
Let's go through it once more.

838
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,318
What will you say when Jack comes?

839
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,030
Hi, Jack. Want some pancakes?

840
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:29,158
Come on. I'll put the thing on.

841
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,518
Come on.

842
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,438
There we go.

843
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:37,830
Yes, today we go to victory.

844
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,439
Here we go.

845
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,837
Here we are.

846
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,439
Sorry.

847
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,593
You do well,
you'll be leader of the pack.

848
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:51,512
Industry is dead!
Bread lines are forming!

849
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:55,469
America is bankrupt!
The future is anarchy!

850
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:56,835
Be alert!

851
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:00,430
The have-nots will soon
be coming after those...

852
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,155
...smart enough to prepare
for the inevitable end.

853
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,472
Looting may occur any day or night!

854
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,359
So use your eyes, and your ears!

855
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,830
Move out! Move out!

856
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:17,437
Was Donald signed up
for the looter course?

857
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,674
He paid the fee.

858
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:28,431
I love the smell
of malamute in the morning!

859
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,436
He chewed through the ropes.

860
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:46,438
He's more primitive than I thought.

861
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,713
No more for me.

862
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,430
You only had to watch him
for 15 minutes!

863
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,432
I did.

864
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:57,629
Where is he?

865
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,673
God knows. He's not as dumb
as I thought.

866
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,434
He has to be
around here somewhere...

867
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:06,712
...because I had my eye on him
the whole time.

868
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,269
- You fell asleep.
- I didn't.

869
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,636
I swear. I...

870
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,839
Look, here's what happened. I was...

871
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,759
You were asleep. I was wide awake.

872
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,834
And he was asleep.
And I was awake and watching him.

873
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,039
And, well, I think
he released this gas.

874
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,034
And...

875
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,957
...he must've had it in his shoes...

876
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,349
Candice.

877
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:42,035
Okay, I'm not sure about the gas,
but what happened was...

878
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,188
All right, I fell asleep.
I'm sorry. I messed up.

879
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,636
You hate me, right?

880
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,355
Just sit here, understand?

881
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:08,515
And don't open the door.
Not to anybody. Okay?

882
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,958
- Where's Don?
- He had to leave in a hurry.

883
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,832
Something's not kosher.

884
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,634
Somebody tell me what's going on.

885
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:25,031
Something's wrong.
I can smell it like a dog.

886
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,998
You are what you eat.

887
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:35,472
- What's this?
- I was making a sweater.

888
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,758
What have you done with Donald?

889
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:51,954
Shit.

890
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,272
No! Not now!

891
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:06,677
Don't chicken out! Stay!

892
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,758
Goddamn it!

893
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:41,031
Your gun jammed, Mr. Honky Mo'Fo?

894
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,838
Shit!

895
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,628
My God, that's sick.

896
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:30,034
What kind of man
gives cigarettes to trees?

897
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,630
Come on out and fight!

898
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:38,229
I don't want to have to kill you!

899
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,032
You don't want to...

900
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:51,030
You're not gonna kill me the slow way
by leaving cigarettes in trees.

901
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:55,319
You want to try and kill me?

902
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:59,439
Well, Mr. Honky Mo'Fo,
take your best shot!

903
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,234
Shit, the same arm!

904
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:11,030
It's too cold. My arm's frozen.
That's why I'm not bleeding.

905
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:22,999
Men, I have to ask you to do something
I haven't fully trained you for.

906
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,036
I have to ask you to kill.

907
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,436
Don't be intimidated, men.

908
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,073
I'm merely speaking of some
simple, scum-sucking vermin.

909
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:38,271
It's not the starving city
vermin we've been hoping for...

910
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:42,229
...but these days you have to take
what you can get.

911
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,232
Sorry, Wes.

912
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,032
Go ahead.

913
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:54,039
You will be up against
a professional killer.

914
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,039
Now this is us!

915
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,235
The vermin could be on this road...

916
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:06,036
...or he could be in the luxury
survival residence of our own Donald.

917
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:12,638
We're going to be here!
And we're going to be here!

918
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,637
And the command post here!

919
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:17,513
The special squad
will surround the post.

920
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:21,036
Those with weapons
that fire full auto...

921
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,310
Excuse me, are you saying...

922
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:26,518
...you want us to shoot a real person?

923
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:29,354
That's what you're trained for here.

924
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,033
This cost extra?

925
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,909
You shot my gun, goddamn it!

926
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:04,232
You're not supposed to shoot
a person's gun!

927
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,436
That pisses me off!

928
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,634
You know how much one of these costs?

929
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:16,956
You think you got me?
This one has your name and address!

930
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,239
Jack?

931
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,032
Yeah?

932
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,031
Time out, okay?

933
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,633
What?

934
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,832
Time out.

935
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,316
You won't believe this...

936
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,440
...but I brought the wrong bullets.

937
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,231
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

938
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,432
This morning I was in a hurry
to get out...

939
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:57,035
...and I brought the wrong ammo.

940
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,037
Silly me. It's a mistake
anybody could make!

941
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:05,512
What do you want me to do?
Make a few snowballs...

942
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,718
...while you get bullets
to shoot at me?

943
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,632
Would you mind?

944
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:15,719
I'll be right back!
Lt'll just take a minute!

945
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,110
Yeah, you go right ahead!

946
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,351
I knew you were church people.

947
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,353
Liar!

948
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:28,875
Mush!

949
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,155
Shit!

950
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,239
Men...

951
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,036
...follow me.

952
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,318
Donald!

953
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,836
You idiot, you'll get us all killed!

954
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,151
Where the hell are you?

955
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,714
No, wait! Whoa!

956
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:00,629
Why are you here?

957
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,440
You're alive! Where's Jack?

958
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:07,468
Unfortunately, he's alive too.
Now get on! Move it!

959
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,758
I emptied the clip!

960
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,479
I put more bullets in.

961
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:19,234
.38 caliber don't fit. 45 caliber!

962
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,113
That's why I'm here. Ammunition. Help!

963
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:27,835
You made me slap my hand!
Why am I wearing all this?

964
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,877
Strip down for efficiency!

965
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:32,156
He ruined my gun. $1000!

966
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,550
- These?
- I need. 45s.

967
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,756
Those are long and thin!

968
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,230
I need. 45, short and fat.

969
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,232
Short and fat.

970
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:44,671
You checked in.
Bless you for staying with me.

971
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,910
You're not going any place.

972
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:52,472
I'm standing here, and you
and your bullets won't get by.

973
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,472
We're staying alive.

974
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,278
Candice, quit helping.

975
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:00,439
Listen, I didn't ask you
to come up here and save me.

976
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:03,433
I came up here to save myself.

977
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:04,829
- Really?
- Yeah.

978
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:10,836
Well, I guess it's like what Wes says:

979
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,635
"When it comes down to it,
it's every man for himself.

980
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,476
And no man is an island.
And some men are peninsulas. "

981
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:21,229
- What?
- I don't want you to die.

982
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,032
Don't kiss my ass now.

983
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:26,038
- You're my friend!
- Too late for that.

984
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,838
Jack, let's talk!

985
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:32,038
Not interested.
Somebody's trying to kill me.

986
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:35,033
I would get away from the window.

987
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:39,359
Can't anyone look
without breaking a window?

988
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,160
I didn't even have this house
paid for.

989
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:47,396
White platoon, get across the front
and lay down perimeter fire.

990
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,068
I can't go into battle wearing this.

991
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,834
How will I draw? Or reload?

992
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,469
Or move with cat-like swiftness?

993
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:58,672
Just guard the briefcase.
It holds the future.

994
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:01,473
Throw out your weapons!

995
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:05,156
How do you feel now,
Mr. Bigshot-gun-for-hire?

996
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,679
Those are my people!

997
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:15,553
One of you fire a warning shot.

998
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,510
My friends are trigger-happy.

999
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,116
Go say we're coming out.

1000
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,075
"We"? I ain't going out.

1001
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:36,676
I can't face them
if he's in here still alive.

1002
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:40,833
You think I'll let you shoot me
so you'll look good?

1003
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,359
- You crazy.
- Chicken.

1004
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,835
Stop bickering and think!

1005
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:49,670
I will count to five, at which time,
if you have not surrendered...

1006
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,718
...I'll give the command to open fire.

1007
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,235
- He tried to kill me.
- Who shot first?

1008
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:58,278
I didn't put a hole in your jacket.

1009
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,833
- Look!
- One.

1010
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,270
Who tried to make a deal? Me!

1011
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:05,239
Then who shoots up the trees?
Yeah, you!

1012
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:07,869
- I was nervous.
- Two.

1013
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:11,436
- What about me?
- You're so cool you piss ice cubes.

1014
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:12,829
Check weapons.

1015
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:16,828
It's hereditary in my family.
Nerves, colitis...

1016
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:19,196
Must be horrible having colitis.

1017
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,516
- They must hear you coming.
- Three.

1018
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:24,871
These are wonderful. You'll love it.
Rolaids!

1019
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:29,518
- Hurry up, I need one.
- Oh, God.

1020
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,159
Want a Rolaid?

1021
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,630
I got some Valium if you want.

1022
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,037
Take aim.

1023
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,752
It's okay. You can all go home.

1024
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,560
Thanks for coming. We don't need you.

1025
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:49,832
Send out the vermin!

1026
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:53,430
- This can be settled peacefully.
- No, it can't.

1027
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:57,036
Send him out or we open fire.

1028
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,030
What's the matter with you?

1029
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:08,118
Suddenly everybody wants
to shoot everybody!

1030
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:11,433
You've been around here too long.

1031
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:15,838
You're waiting... no, hoping...
for this country to fall apart.

1032
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:19,875
You got paper targets
that look like real people...

1033
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,759
...so you can kill
with no more thought...

1034
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,639
...than putting a hole
in a piece of paper.

1035
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,112
Are you guys insane?

1036
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,634
Just knock each other off right now.

1037
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:37,628
You can start with me
if that's what we're coming to.

1038
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:41,196
If you're the future,
I don't want to see it!

1039
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:08,716
This could be a trick.

1040
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:13,272
"As our beloved General Douglas
MacArthur once said:

1041
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:17,274
The soldier, above all other people...

1042
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,909
...prays for peace.

1043
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:23,436
For he must suffer and bear...

1044
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,598
...the deepest wounds
and scars of war.

1045
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:30,749
The soldier is the noblest development
of mankind.

1046
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:35,629
But no brute instinct
can take the place...

1047
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:38,110
...of divine help. "

1048
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:46,389
Horse shit.

1049
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:53,359
- Dad!
- Go back.

1050
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,034
This scumbag's gonna die!

1051
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:59,477
- What are you doing?
- I got the drop on him!

1052
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,233
Go to the car. Now.

1053
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,670
Get out of here, old man!

1054
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:05,558
Take that hippie girl!

1055
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,519
Know what's wrong with you?
You're meek.

1056
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:12,275
They'll inherit the earth!
To the depth of six feet!

1057
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,870
I'm going to blow his mind!
He's going to be bloody!

1058
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:18,634
He'll be a steaming hunk of goo!

1059
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,236
I'll tear his ears off
and hang them in my car...

1060
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:23,959
...like furry dice!

1061
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:27,556
We'll put his eyes there
so he can see what I said!

1062
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,074
You were my favourite...

1063
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:32,039
Then I'll make a tire
of his intestines!

1064
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:33,434
Talk soft.

1065
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,916
We should call the police.
It's good publicity.

1066
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,957
No, he's mine!

1067
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,077
- Please turn me...
- Shut up!

1068
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:44,118
No, you're gonna crawl, sleaze bag.

1069
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:47,716
You'll die like a whimpering dog
in the dirt!

1070
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:52,078
Or like a whimpering cat in the dirt.
Move it!

1071
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,673
- What are you doing?
- We wanna watch.

1072
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,869
It's a private thing!
Between him and me.

1073
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:06,113
Mano a mano.
It's how John Wayne would do it.

1074
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,670
You know, he's right.

1075
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:14,559
Here. You'll need this.

1076
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,434
If you need help, we'll be here.

1077
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,239
Bless you, Wes.

1078
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,153
Move it, dickhead! Come on, haul it!

1079
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:26,392
You'll die like a man! Or a facsimile.

1080
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:32,629
This is where we're to meet.

1081
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,633
At least, I think this is where.

1082
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:40,428
- Did Donald come up with this plan?
- Yeah.

1083
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:43,837
Then it doesn't matter. It won't work.

1084
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,877
<i>This is Don. Over.</i>

1085
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,953
We read you.
Do you need assistance? Over.

1086
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,555
<i>Negative. Wish you could be here.</i>

1087
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:55,433
<i>Up off your knees, slime mold!</i>

1088
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:58,632
<i>I'm about 200... from the...</i>

1089
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,957
<i>...follow the trail of blood
to the large pine...</i>

1090
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,838
<i>My knife!</i>

1091
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:05,589
<i>Now I'm...</i>

1092
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:10,438
- He's begging for mercy.
- Please, no!

1093
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:18,035
<i>I'm now taking...</i>

1094
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:22,910
<i>His tongue is in my hand!</i>

1095
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:26,232
His tongue is in his hand?

1096
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,479
Where's his tongue?

1097
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,432
Jesus.

1098
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,796
That sounded like a car door.

1099
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:49,109
Don? Come in, Don.

1100
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,238
<i>Now from the stage
of the Grand Ole Opry...</i>

1101
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:55,876
<i>...it's Bill Monroe and his
Blue Grass boys singing:</i>

1102
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:59,237
<i>"Wes, Stick It Where The Sun
Don't Shine. "</i>

1103
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,029
Come on!

1104
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:12,434
To the sleds! I want them alive. Get
those bastards! I want them back.

1105
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:17,509
Let go!

1106
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:20,029
- Let me drive.
- What's wrong?

1107
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:23,073
You're driving like a trout
with diarrhea.

1108
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:24,309
Don't start!

1109
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:29,230
Wiley, move your mutts!
Every man, every weapon, follow me!

1110
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:31,710
This is great. Look at that.

1111
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:36,433
Those dogs are fast.

1112
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:41,599
There ain't a dog alive
that'll catch this car.

1113
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:44,959
Come on, let's go!

1114
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:06,313
Think you were
a little wide on that turn?

1115
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:08,232
I smell gas.

1116
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:11,552
I'd like to get out now if I could.

1117
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,028
I'd like out.

1118
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:16,636
I don't want to die! I got to get out!

1119
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,154
Let me out!

1120
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:24,434
Good. This'll be like
shooting fish in a barrel.

1121
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:26,159
Now we fire, right?

1122
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:29,039
Now we wait for the support team.

1123
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,552
I'll show you how to...

1124
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:36,035
Would you move!
This car ain't worth shit.

1125
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:38,629
Everybody out of the car.

1126
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:42,478
Everybody back in.

1127
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:44,671
They sure put one over on us.

1128
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:48,635
This is the last time anybody
makes you look dumb.

1129
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:52,476
Move over. I'm driving.

1130
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:56,750
They're not doing anything
but taunting us. Move!

1131
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,031
You're moving!

1132
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,271
You're free!

1133
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,238
Keep going!

1134
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,198
You're free!

1135
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,389
You're stuck!

1136
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:09,438
That does it for me.

1137
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:11,039
They're sneaking away.

1138
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,872
Fire a warning shot!

1139
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,838
- Just one.
- Check.

1140
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:18,396
- Want to give me a hand?
- Well, maybe...

1141
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,229
Don't shoot.

1142
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:25,317
- Those guys are morons.
- Well-armed morons.

1143
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:29,269
This is one of the neatest
times we've ever had.

1144
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,468
- They're too far to shoot.
- Close enough.

1145
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,391
When I go around the corner...

1146
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:42,032
Hold it! Wait a minute!

1147
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,755
Move out! And take them alive!

1148
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:49,758
- Where you going?
- Queens Blvd.

1149
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,433
What about them?

1150
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:55,913
Okay.

1151
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:03,035
A medal to whoever gets them!

1152
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:09,515
Follow them! Forget the old fart!

1153
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:12,433
Why are the dogs chasing the car?

1154
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,079
They aren't listening!

1155
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,993
Way to go! You're freaking them out!

1156
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:18,428
Watch it!

1157
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,835
Wiley, come now!

1158
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:29,349
Oh, shit!

1159
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:33,155
Stop! Stay where you are.
Nobody touch anything.

1160
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,475
Freeze!

1161
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:38,076
Our futures depend on these.
Do not read them.

1162
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,436
You wouldn't understand.

1163
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:41,868
Thank you, I got it.

1164
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:48,158
These are the plans for the
reorganization of society?

1165
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:49,435
May I have that?

1166
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:53,633
That says you own a Minnie Pearl
takeout franchise in Detroit.

1167
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:54,829
Great chicken.

1168
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:59,830
New York City Municipal Bonds
due in the year 2025.

1169
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,837
I love Broadway theatre.

1170
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:06,875
You've got 5000 shares in U.S. Steel,
Christmas Club accounts...

1171
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:09,429
Three books of S&H Green stamps.

1172
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:10,675
I can explain.

1173
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:15,436
And a catalogue with a circle around
an outdoor barbecue for 20 books.

1174
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:17,238
All right!

1175
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:19,359
All right.

1176
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,273
Listen...

1177
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,715
...I believe in America.

1178
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:26,428
I'm just a simple businessman.

1179
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:30,036
That's all it's about, isn't it?
Capitalism?

1180
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:33,118
Making the most of an opportunity.

1181
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:34,673
Know what I mean?

1182
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:37,354
Give us our money back.

1183
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:38,595
No refunds.

1184
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,074
I got my receipt.

1185
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:45,633
But I could make each one of you a
partner in a mini-mart in Pittsburgh.

1186
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:56,636
I think I got to go now.

1187
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:03,036
You really got to hand it to that guy.

1188
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:07,631
I mean, economy's in the toilet
and he's making a bundle.

1189
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:17,398
Guess I have to find
a sucker to buy my cabin.

1190
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:21,430
You don't have to worry.
You don't own the land.

1191
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:25,030
Wes has a two-year lease
on the land...

1192
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:27,231
...from the Iroquois Indians.

1193
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:34,074
I bet the Indians are having
some laughs about this.

1194
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:37,033
I hope this isn't
a personal question...

1195
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,834
...but where did you put Jimmy Hoffa?

1196
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:44,470
It was a hype.

1197
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:48,037
You injected him?

1198
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:49,838
No, I didn't kill him.

1199
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:54,830
Nobody else took credit. Figured
it'd do wonders for my reputation.

1200
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,793
- You didn't kill him?
- Didn't even know him.

1201
01:33:58,160 --> 01:33:59,149
You kidding?

1202
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:04,156
I figure they'll catch up with me
on a lot of other stuff I did.

1203
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:08,837
I won't worry about it.
I have faith in our system of justice.

1204
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:13,513
Could we pull the car over?
I'd like to get some air.

1205
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:17,354
Maybe you'd better pull over.

1206
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:31,632
Where are you going?

1207
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:39,033
There's air over there by the car.
It's the same air.

1208
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:44,352
Did you get sick riding in the back?
I always do.

1209
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:46,636
I don't know where I'm going.

1210
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:49,678
I think you're heading directly north.

1211
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:52,718
I don't know what's real anymore.

1212
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,635
These are real trees. Real snow.
It's real cold.

1213
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,837
I used to be on my way up.

1214
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:03,113
Now I look like I'm on my way to
a Veterans Day parade in Nome.

1215
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:04,759
I'm going nowhere.

1216
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,639
I know what you need. A good meal.

1217
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:10,235
Some hot solid food. Beef stew.

1218
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:14,473
- Let's find a diner.
- I can't go dressed like this.

1219
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:17,439
I look like a guardian Eskimo.

1220
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:22,431
I don't have a job.

1221
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:26,235
I don't have any money.

1222
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:29,239
I don't have any place to live.

1223
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:33,239
I don't even have Doreen anymore.

1224
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:37,029
- You'll get pneumonia!
- At least that's something.

1225
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:41,438
- Are you nuts?
- Yes.

1226
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,238
I think I am.

1227
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:53,038
You know, it's not that bad.

1228
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:58,235
You'll freeze!

1229
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:06,871
You're right. I'm freezing.

1230
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:12,752
What do I do now?

1231
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:16,869
The first thing you'll do
is take my coat.

1232
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:18,633
Then you'll freeze.

1233
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:21,440
That's okay. We'll freeze together.

1234
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:25,238
Thanks.

1235
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:31,837
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1236
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:34,830
Tell me things will work out.

1237
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:37,629
Everything will work out.

1238
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:43,752
Boy, it's been a strange winter,
hasn't it?

1239
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,230
Not really.

1240
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:39,109
