1
00:00:03,193 --> 00:00:06,329
( theme music playing )

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,074
Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

3
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:24,173
( groans )

4
00:01:45,262 --> 00:01:46,463
Hello, darling.

5
00:01:48,332 --> 00:01:50,233
- I hope I didn't wake you.
- Not at all.

6
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:53,269
It's the first time you've made
my headboard rattle this year.

7
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,739
I wouldn't have wanted to miss that.

8
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,141
- Where've you been?
- You know where I've been, my petal.

9
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:01,878
At my pub quiz night.

10
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:04,347
The pubs close at 11:00.

11
00:02:04,348 --> 00:02:06,048
Yes, that's true.

12
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:07,717
But I've been buying you a present.

13
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:10,854
- What?
- A kebab.

14
00:02:12,356 --> 00:02:14,624
I don't want your horrid kebab.

15
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,225
- Oh.
- Raymond,

16
00:02:16,226 --> 00:02:18,160
Is that lipstick on your collar?

17
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:20,563
Uh, no, it's ketchup.

18
00:02:20,564 --> 00:02:23,299
- Good.
- I remember now,

19
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,369
Constable Habib was
eating ketchupy chips

20
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,871
When I kissed her.

21
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:30,139
You kissed constable Habib?

22
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,375
We're through to the
local final, Patricia.

23
00:02:32,376 --> 00:02:34,477
We're one game away from the trophy.

24
00:02:34,478 --> 00:02:36,979
So you kissed Maggie Habib?

25
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,983
Yes. I very nearly kissed
constable Kray as well.

26
00:02:40,984 --> 00:02:42,819
Loathsome man as he is,

27
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,788
He does know the halftime scores

28
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,556
Of every cup final since 1918.

29
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,394
 another one bites the dust... 

30
00:02:51,395 --> 00:02:53,797
 and another one bites,
another one bites 

31
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,698
 another one bites the dust! 

32
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:57,300
Oh, god.

33
00:02:57,301 --> 00:03:00,737
You know how much the
quiz trophy means to me.

34
00:03:00,738 --> 00:03:04,340
It's the only glittering
prize I've ever truly coveted.

35
00:03:04,341 --> 00:03:06,342
So you kissed Maggie Habib.

36
00:03:06,343 --> 00:03:07,944
Yes.

37
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:10,279
I can't tell you how wonderful she was.

38
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,681
Well, don't.

39
00:03:11,682 --> 00:03:14,751
It was all down to the
last question, you see?

40
00:03:14,752 --> 00:03:17,887
I'd been stumped on the
name of the chancellor

41
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,022
In the Israeli's second administration.

42
00:03:20,023 --> 00:03:23,526
Would you believe it?
Mr. Thickey or what?

43
00:03:23,527 --> 00:03:26,896
That oaf Kray had gone
completely to pieces

44
00:03:26,897 --> 00:03:29,365
Over the 1932 soviet discus team.

45
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:33,470
Frankly, things were
looking pretty bleak...

46
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:37,273
Until Habib, dear, beautiful,

47
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:39,943
Clever little constable Habib

48
00:03:39,944 --> 00:03:42,311
Pulled off a stunning coup

49
00:03:42,312 --> 00:03:45,949
By knowing the names of
all a gorilla's vertebrae.

50
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:48,918
What a woman.

51
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,419
What a woman!

52
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,057
Darling, what?

53
00:03:55,058 --> 00:03:57,694
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Really, it's nothing.

54
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,963
Oh, that's all right then.

55
00:03:59,964 --> 00:04:03,366
I thought you were upset or something.

56
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:05,535
I'm going to brush my teeth.

57
00:04:06,737 --> 00:04:08,805
I can't remember the last time you said

58
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:10,339
What a wonderful woman I was.

59
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,174
Oh, come on, darling.

60
00:04:12,175 --> 00:04:16,112
You don't know the skeletal
composition of the gorilla family.

61
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:17,146
Be serious.

62
00:04:23,687 --> 00:04:25,321
- Morning.
- Good morning.

63
00:04:25,322 --> 00:04:28,024
Morning, everyone. Good morning.

64
00:04:31,395 --> 00:04:34,697
Um, you're not annoyed
with me, are you, sergeant?

65
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:36,666
No, not at all.

66
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:39,468
It's just that at breakfast
I couldn't help noticing

67
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:41,203
That you crunched your cornflakes

68
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:42,906
In rather an aggressive manner.

69
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,841
- ( pen thumping )
- did I?

70
00:04:44,842 --> 00:04:47,544
And you did make my
tea with cold water...

71
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:52,148
And yesterday's teabag

72
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:54,083
In my bicycle helmet.

73
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,254
Not that it wasn't lovely.

74
00:04:58,255 --> 00:04:59,956
- Most refreshing.
- Raymond,

75
00:04:59,957 --> 00:05:02,324
I am not in the slightest bit angry.

76
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:03,893
Good, good.

77
00:05:03,894 --> 00:05:07,964
So the brillo pad in my
shredded wheat was a mistake?

78
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:09,799
Morning, all.

79
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,101
Ah, Kray, fresh from
last night's triumph.

80
00:05:12,102 --> 00:05:13,670
What are you eating?

81
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:16,706
Breakfast, isn't it? Beef and
onion pie. Do you want a bit?

82
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:18,942
Beef and onion pie? Spit it out, man!

83
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,010
Haven't you heard of mad cow disease?

84
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:24,180
Come on, sir, no one
worries about that anymore.

85
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:27,383
Nobody worries about cricketers
chewing gum and spitting anymore,

86
00:05:27,384 --> 00:05:30,252
But that doesn't mean it has
ceased to be a national disgrace.

87
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:32,321
I can't go without my beef.

88
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:35,658
Personally, I don't believe
all those stories anyway.

89
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:39,062
As far as I'm concerned you could
get more sense out of a british cow

90
00:05:39,063 --> 00:05:41,230
Than you will out of a
packet of german sausages.

91
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:47,070
Very possibly, but the final of
the pub quiz is only a week away.

92
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:48,404
We can take no chances.

93
00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:50,473
From now on, I suggest
you eat only fish,

94
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:53,175
Preferably raw. Seafood is brain food.

95
00:05:53,176 --> 00:05:54,510
That's true, sir.

96
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:56,579
Murgatroyd, who lives next door to me,

97
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,615
Eats nothing but fish.

98
00:05:58,616 --> 00:06:02,451
And she can lick her own backside,
which I think is very clever.

99
00:06:04,588 --> 00:06:07,456
Would I be right in assuming
that Murgatroyd is a cat?

100
00:06:07,457 --> 00:06:09,859
No, sir, she's a contortionist.

101
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,195
( laughs )

102
00:06:14,865 --> 00:06:18,201
I've got a tough job on,
and I need your cooperation.

103
00:06:18,202 --> 00:06:20,303
Now it's pretty urgent,

104
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:23,639
So I won't beat about
the proverbial privet.

105
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:28,545
Frankly, I'm too busy a man
to be cluck-clucking away

106
00:06:28,546 --> 00:06:30,947
Like a decapitated feathered fowl,

107
00:06:30,948 --> 00:06:32,582
So I'll get straight to the point.

108
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,117
I'm delighted to hear it.

109
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:36,852
"time waits for no man,"
as the proverb goes.

110
00:06:36,853 --> 00:06:38,988
What I say is, in C.I.D.,

111
00:06:38,989 --> 00:06:40,923
Crime waits for no man.

112
00:06:40,924 --> 00:06:44,327
So with that in mind, I shall
cut the bovine feces altogether.

113
00:06:44,328 --> 00:06:47,397
- Good.
- This is C.I.D. Work, Raymond.

114
00:06:47,398 --> 00:06:50,633
In C.I.D. We dispense with niceties.

115
00:06:50,634 --> 00:06:54,437
We avoid irrelevance,
we disregard herrings-

116
00:06:54,438 --> 00:06:55,838
Red or otherwise-

117
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,209
And above all we do not fanny about.

118
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:02,412
- Inspector Grim?
- What?

119
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:05,348
Was there something
you wanted to discuss?

120
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:06,749
Oh yes.

121
00:07:08,586 --> 00:07:10,453
To be blunt, Raymond,

122
00:07:10,454 --> 00:07:13,423
I need a woman and I want your help.

123
00:07:13,424 --> 00:07:16,226
Right.

124
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,662
Derek, I'm glad you felt
able to come to me about this.

125
00:07:19,663 --> 00:07:23,166
How strong are these urges,
and how long have you had them?

126
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:25,435
A policewoman, you idiot.

127
00:07:25,436 --> 00:07:28,804
We've been on to a major
local villain for months,

128
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:30,340
But he's slippery,

129
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:31,574
Like an owl.

130
00:07:35,346 --> 00:07:37,813
He does, however, have a weakness.

131
00:07:37,814 --> 00:07:39,882
And that weakness is totty.

132
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:41,951
Totty?

133
00:07:41,952 --> 00:07:44,954
Birds, bints, anything in a skirt-

134
00:07:44,955 --> 00:07:47,423
Barring a scotsman.

135
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:50,226
He's a ladies' man.

136
00:07:50,227 --> 00:07:53,029
Are you suggesting an
entrapment operation?

137
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,730
Not entrapment, Raymond.

138
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:57,433
Entrapment is, as you know, illegal.

139
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,835
But blokes drop their guard with girls.

140
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:01,804
They don't think of the consequences.

141
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:04,440
Blimey, we've all done it.

142
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:08,010
You get all stupid
with some young lovely

143
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:10,680
And before you know it you're bald,

144
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:13,983
40, sitting in the car park

145
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:16,852
At Sainsbury's home base.

146
00:08:18,322 --> 00:08:20,223
Now I want someone with brains.

147
00:08:20,224 --> 00:08:22,225
Brains and beauty.

148
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:23,993
- Your report, sir.
- Thank you.

149
00:08:23,994 --> 00:08:26,329
I want Habib.

150
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,331
You cannot have her.

151
00:08:28,332 --> 00:08:31,701
I strongly disapprove of this type
of dubious, underhand operation.

152
00:08:31,702 --> 00:08:33,636
We're not talking about a honey trap,

153
00:08:33,637 --> 00:08:35,471
Just a bit of intelligence gathering.

154
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:38,007
C.I.D. Cannot operate
without intelligence.

155
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:41,311
You seem to have managed
very well up till now.

156
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,645
Listen,

157
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:44,581
The bloke is laughing at the law.

158
00:08:44,582 --> 00:08:47,016
If you're not careful,
division'll hand it over

159
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:48,918
And we'll have the flying squad back.

160
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,786
You really think so?

161
00:08:50,787 --> 00:08:53,089
Of course if all we're
doing is fannying about.

162
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,092
I don't much care for the
flying squad, I must say.

163
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:57,893
Arrogant oafs to a man.

164
00:08:57,894 --> 00:08:59,795
The last time they were here,

165
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:03,132
One of them left chewing
gum stuck under my desk.

166
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:06,202
I mean, what sort of mentality?

167
00:09:06,203 --> 00:09:08,338
And the state of the lavatories-

168
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,007
It was almost as if they
were aiming for the floor.

169
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,646
These men are trained
marksmen, for heaven's sake.

170
00:09:16,647 --> 00:09:19,282
All I'd say is, if you're
ever cornered by one,

171
00:09:19,283 --> 00:09:21,317
Head for the gents' and hide in a urinal

172
00:09:21,318 --> 00:09:23,720
Because they're incapable of hitting it.

173
00:09:23,721 --> 00:09:26,122
Right.

174
00:09:26,123 --> 00:09:28,057
And if you don't want them round here

175
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:31,294
Chewing gum and
dampening our facilities,

176
00:09:31,295 --> 00:09:33,829
You'd better start cooperating with me.

177
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,666
I'll talk to the girl and
see how she feels about it.

178
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,033
Well, do it discreetly.

179
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:39,702
It's not the sort of operation

180
00:09:39,703 --> 00:09:41,904
That wants to be blabbed
round the station.

181
00:09:41,905 --> 00:09:44,006
Tell no one but Habib.

182
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:46,509
I don't need to be told
my duty, inspector Grim.

183
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,943
Well, I hope not,

184
00:09:47,944 --> 00:09:50,079
Because it's my backside on the line

185
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,415
And I'm right up to my neck in it.

186
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,921
Ah, constable Habib.

187
00:09:58,922 --> 00:10:00,489
Come in, sit down.

188
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,794
Now then, I've asked
you to come and see me

189
00:10:05,795 --> 00:10:07,896
On a matter of considerable delicacy.

190
00:10:07,897 --> 00:10:10,066
Right you are, inspector.
You can trust me.

191
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,834
I sincerely hope I can.

192
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:15,071
Because I wish to discuss an
extremely sensitive operation.

193
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,973
Oh, I see.

194
00:10:16,974 --> 00:10:18,740
My dad's just had one of those.

195
00:10:18,741 --> 00:10:21,643
Bowel complaints are very
common in men of your age.

196
00:10:21,644 --> 00:10:24,347
I'm talking about a police
operation, constable.

197
00:10:24,348 --> 00:10:26,015
Oh, I see, sir. Sorry.

198
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:27,683
What's more, for the record,

199
00:10:27,684 --> 00:10:30,019
My bowels are in perfect working order.

200
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,822
- Glad to hear it, sir.
- You could set your watch by them.

201
00:10:33,823 --> 00:10:35,757
I haven't missed an evacuation

202
00:10:35,758 --> 00:10:38,027
In 25 years of public service.

203
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:41,630
However, I am not here to discuss

204
00:10:41,631 --> 00:10:44,533
My quite excellent digestive system.

205
00:10:44,534 --> 00:10:47,169
I'm here to discuss a police matter.

206
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,207
You are to be seconded to the
criminal investigations department.

207
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,441
C.I.D.?!

208
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:55,344
Yes, yes, the C.I.D., if you must.

209
00:10:55,345 --> 00:10:58,447
Although it's beyond me why
perfectly serviceable sentences

210
00:10:58,448 --> 00:11:01,617
Must always be reduced to
graceless, lifeless initials.

211
00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:05,821
Why, when Mark Antony stood
bestride Caesar's grave declaiming,

212
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:08,124
"friends, Romans, countrymen,"

213
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,892
Would he have done better to say,

214
00:11:09,893 --> 00:11:11,927
"F.R.C.S"?

215
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:13,462
It would've saved time, sir.

216
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:15,131
Initials are easier and quicker.

217
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,199
Yes, but does that make them better?

218
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,800
Life would be easier and quicker

219
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:21,203
If we popped our clogs at birth.

220
00:11:21,204 --> 00:11:24,173
That way we would avoid all
those slow, troublesome things

221
00:11:24,174 --> 00:11:26,342
Like long walks in the country,

222
00:11:26,343 --> 00:11:27,743
Games of chess,

223
00:11:27,744 --> 00:11:30,679
Long, languid, lingering...

224
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,947
Oh, what's the word?

225
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:34,083
- Sex?
- I was going to say

226
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:36,318
Amontillado sherries before lunch,

227
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,055
But yes, if you like, sex.

228
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:41,690
Would you prefer sex, constable Habib,

229
00:11:41,691 --> 00:11:43,725
If it was quick and easy?

230
00:11:48,898 --> 00:11:50,699
Yes, sergeant, was there something?

231
00:11:52,536 --> 00:11:54,703
What is constable Habib
doing in your office?

232
00:11:54,704 --> 00:11:56,605
Now that I cannot say, sergeant.

233
00:11:56,606 --> 00:11:58,941
Constable Habib and I
were discussing something

234
00:11:58,942 --> 00:12:01,210
Which must remain private
between the two of us.

235
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:04,380
- Private?
- I fear so. Now what can I do for you?

236
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:06,282
There's a delivery for you.

237
00:12:06,283 --> 00:12:08,117
Constable Goody?

238
00:12:10,954 --> 00:12:13,055
We've got the new "er," sir.

239
00:12:14,091 --> 00:12:16,024
- The new er?
- That's right.

240
00:12:16,025 --> 00:12:17,960
The er. Beautiful it is.

241
00:12:17,961 --> 00:12:19,528
Beautiful and shiny.

242
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,697
A beautiful and shiny er.

243
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:27,002
- You ordered it.
- I ordered an er?

244
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:30,139
Yes, and now it's come.
Frank's been polishing it up.

245
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,841
Come on, Frank. Show
inspector Fowler his new er.

246
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:36,044
Oh, of course.

247
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:37,946
The new desk crest. E.R.

248
00:12:37,947 --> 00:12:39,781
Yes, that's right, "er."

249
00:12:41,184 --> 00:12:43,419
Constable Goody, this
is the royal crest.

250
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,388
Yes, I know that. I'm not thick, am I?

251
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:49,291
If you knew that this crest
represented the authority

252
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:50,459
Of her majesty the queen,

253
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,294
What in the devil's briefcase

254
00:12:52,295 --> 00:12:54,163
Did you imagine E.R. stood for?

255
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:57,299
'er in the palace.

256
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:04,573
Elizabeth Regina. It
stands for Elizabeth Regina!

257
00:13:04,574 --> 00:13:06,074
I never knew that.

258
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:09,778
I thought it stood for extremely royal.

259
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,747
E.R. is initials, isn't it, sir?

260
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:13,649
Are they graceless and lifeless?

261
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,651
Don't be clever, Habib.

262
00:13:15,652 --> 00:13:17,953
The public mistrusts
clever police officers.

263
00:13:17,954 --> 00:13:21,056
They think they're up to something.

264
00:13:21,057 --> 00:13:23,559
Clear off, you lot, and hang
that above the front desk.

265
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,628
I'm in the middle of
a sensitive meeting.

266
00:13:28,165 --> 00:13:30,699
I'm afraid I shall have to
ask you to leave too, sergeant.

267
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,968
You're throwing me out of your office?

268
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:34,936
Reluctantly, I'm afraid that I am.

269
00:13:34,937 --> 00:13:37,839
You see, I wish to be
alone with constable Habib.

270
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,442
You do understand, don't you, sergeant?

271
00:13:40,443 --> 00:13:42,444
Oh, yes.

272
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:44,380
I understand very well.

273
00:13:48,017 --> 00:13:52,020
I must say this er will look
very well up on the wall.

274
00:13:52,021 --> 00:13:53,855
Tell you what, Frank,

275
00:13:53,856 --> 00:13:56,091
You need a big hat to pin that badge on.

276
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:01,730
So constable Habib,

277
00:14:01,731 --> 00:14:04,366
You are to be the bait in a honey trap.

278
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:07,269
You are to dress up in
your finest stockings,

279
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,938
Miniskirt and boob tube

280
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:11,306
To ensnare a hard-bitten thug

281
00:14:11,307 --> 00:14:13,141
Into your sexual web.

282
00:14:13,142 --> 00:14:15,811
I envy you, constable Habib.

283
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:17,913
I would give much for
such an opportunity

284
00:14:17,914 --> 00:14:19,582
To serve my community.

285
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,817
Well, sir, I could lend
you a pair of tights.

286
00:14:21,818 --> 00:14:24,753
Don't be facetious, Habib.

287
00:14:24,754 --> 00:14:27,690
Now if my experience in amateur drama

288
00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:29,424
Has taught me anything,

289
00:14:29,425 --> 00:14:32,561
It is that there's more to
acting than putting on the tights.

290
00:14:32,562 --> 00:14:35,130
One must immerse oneself in a role,

291
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:36,531
Live it, breathe it.

292
00:14:36,532 --> 00:14:38,333
When I was in "Henry V,"

293
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:41,870
I often came to work with a
codpiece under my trousers.

294
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:43,706
Did you play Henry V, sir?

295
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:45,808
Well, not quite Henry, no.

296
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:48,043
I played "man."

297
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:52,280
The point is that if
you take this job on,

298
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:55,450
From tomorrow morning you will
no longer be constable Habib,

299
00:14:55,451 --> 00:14:58,153
Stern, steady, and a
credit to the service.

300
00:14:58,154 --> 00:15:01,323
You will instead be a
right saucy bit of brisket.

301
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:07,162
- Will you do it? - It's got to be
better than collaring shoplifters.

302
00:15:07,163 --> 00:15:09,698
Good. Let's go and see inspector Grim.

303
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:12,367
Just before we do,

304
00:15:12,368 --> 00:15:14,536
One final thing.

305
00:15:14,537 --> 00:15:16,338
Give me the first six primary numbers.

306
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:18,373
One, three, five, seven, 11 and 13, sir.

307
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:20,275
The periodic symbols of iron and gold?

308
00:15:20,276 --> 00:15:21,376
Fe and Au, sir.

309
00:15:21,377 --> 00:15:23,311
The quiz final is six days from now.

310
00:15:23,312 --> 00:15:26,448
- How long is that in half hours?
- 288, sir.

311
00:15:31,121 --> 00:15:34,322
Constable Habib, you
really are very good.

312
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:37,192
I do my best, sir.

313
00:15:37,193 --> 00:15:38,827
Bit of a facer at the end.

314
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:42,031
I must say, I wasn't really
ready for such a hard one.

315
00:15:57,446 --> 00:16:00,515
Constable Habib! What do
you think you're doing?!

316
00:16:00,516 --> 00:16:02,751
You can't come to work
looking like a tart!

317
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:04,987
I've a good mind to
have you disciplined.

318
00:16:04,988 --> 00:16:08,456
It's all right. Inspector Fowler
said he wanted me to dress like this.

319
00:16:10,226 --> 00:16:11,894
Inspector Fowler

320
00:16:11,895 --> 00:16:13,495
Asked you to dress like that?

321
00:16:13,496 --> 00:16:16,264
That's right. He said he
wanted me to look dead sexy.

322
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:20,368
- What do you think, Pat?
- My name is sergeant Dawkins!

323
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:22,971
Why did inspector Fowler
ask you to dress like that?

324
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:25,574
He, he said I wasn't to tell anyone.

325
00:16:25,575 --> 00:16:29,044
Ah, constable Habib,
that's what I like to see.

326
00:16:29,045 --> 00:16:30,679
Splendid. Splendid.

327
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,380
Come on through to the briefing room.

328
00:16:35,284 --> 00:16:38,053
Now remember what I
said about acting, Habib.

329
00:16:38,054 --> 00:16:39,788
Live your character. Live it.

330
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:41,590
Because your life may depend on it.

331
00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:44,126
Right you are, big boy.

332
00:16:52,702 --> 00:16:54,002
( purrs )

333
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,773
Hello, gorgeous.

334
00:16:57,774 --> 00:17:00,375
Mmm, I love a man in a uniform.

335
00:17:00,376 --> 00:17:02,778
( gasps ) is that a
truncheon in your pocket

336
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:04,479
Or are you just pleased to see me?

337
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:14,156
Actually it's a mars bar.

338
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,297
Right then...

339
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:26,301
Constable Habib, you're
with C.I.D. now.

340
00:17:26,302 --> 00:17:29,504
And in C.I.D. we do
things a bit differently.

341
00:17:29,505 --> 00:17:31,673
Oh yes. Oh yes.

342
00:17:31,674 --> 00:17:34,542
When you run us up the flagpole,

343
00:17:34,543 --> 00:17:38,147
You'll find you're saluting a
very different kettle of fish.

344
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:40,749
You know, you could be
a bit tasty, inspector,

345
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,019
I mean if you had hair on
your head instead of your face.

346
00:17:45,721 --> 00:17:48,123
Well done, Habib.

347
00:17:48,124 --> 00:17:52,094
Sorry I'm late. Been down at the
frog and truncheon, setting up a narc.

348
00:17:52,095 --> 00:17:54,930
You didn't drink? Tell
me you didn't drink.

349
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:57,099
'Course not, sir. I never drink on duty.

350
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,767
Only had three pints.

351
00:17:58,768 --> 00:18:02,004
Three pints?! Have you any
idea how many brain cells

352
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:04,239
One unit of alcohol destroys?

353
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,974
Who won the F.A. Cup final in 1953?

354
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:09,444
Um, Blackpool. They beat
Bolton Wanderers 4-3.

355
00:18:09,445 --> 00:18:12,447
You said "um." you're umming, man.

356
00:18:12,448 --> 00:18:14,349
That's the alcohol umming.

357
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,851
Only boozers and losers um.

358
00:18:15,852 --> 00:18:18,320
Inspector Fowler, we are in the middle-

359
00:18:18,321 --> 00:18:21,723
What year was synchronized swimming
admitted as an olympic sport?

360
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:24,226
- Uh, 1984.
- Now you're uhhing.

361
00:18:24,227 --> 00:18:26,328
Good god, man, first
you um and then you uh.

362
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:28,931
It's a short step from that
to, "hang on, I know this one,

363
00:18:28,932 --> 00:18:30,866
Could you repeat the question, please?"

364
00:18:30,867 --> 00:18:33,936
Pull yourself together,
you foul drunkard.

365
00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:37,172
Jane sits to the left of Fred,
who is two seats down from Tony,

366
00:18:37,173 --> 00:18:39,908
Who sits to the right of Jane,
next to the fire extinguisher.

367
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:41,844
Each seat has a width
of two and a half feet

368
00:18:41,845 --> 00:18:43,712
And there's nine inches between them.

369
00:18:43,713 --> 00:18:47,182
In a fire, how far will Fred have to
travel to reach the fire extinguisher?

370
00:18:47,183 --> 00:18:50,285
- Tony would've grabbed it.
- Tony and Jane have fainted from fear.

371
00:18:50,286 --> 00:18:53,856
Inspector Fowler, we are
discussing a dangerous operation.

372
00:18:53,857 --> 00:18:56,225
You're on duty, man,
pull yourself together.

373
00:18:56,226 --> 00:18:57,826
I'm sorry, you're quite right.

374
00:18:57,827 --> 00:19:00,028
I will not mention the quiz again...

375
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:01,563
Except to say

376
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:04,466
That victory will bring
honor to the whole station.

377
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:07,035
Honor... And a big cup.

378
00:19:08,338 --> 00:19:10,538
Big shiny cup.

379
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:12,707
Not that one covets
such trinkets, of course.

380
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:16,845
But a cup that this pathetic alcoholic,

381
00:19:16,846 --> 00:19:20,048
This sad, raddled,
beer-soaked dipsomaniac,

382
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:23,551
Who will no doubt arrive at the
final mounted on a pink elephant,

383
00:19:23,552 --> 00:19:25,220
Chooses to put at risk-

384
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:27,756
- Fowler!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

385
00:19:27,757 --> 00:19:30,325
Please proceed. I will not disturb you

386
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:32,394
Or mention the quiz final ever again.

387
00:19:32,395 --> 00:19:33,896
I'm very glad to hear it.

388
00:19:33,897 --> 00:19:37,266
Right, now, the meeting will take place

389
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:39,101
At the old priest's hole.

390
00:19:39,102 --> 00:19:41,203
- ( gasps )
- What is it now?

391
00:19:41,204 --> 00:19:43,738
The old priest's hole is the
venue for the pub quiz final.

392
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:46,574
- Really?
- Definitely.

393
00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:50,078
Fowler, I'm afraid that means
that Habib is off your quiz team.

394
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:51,813
But she's my star striker.

395
00:19:51,814 --> 00:19:55,050
Exactly. If she turns up
at our villain's boozer

396
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:57,585
As the star of Gasforth
police quiz team,

397
00:19:57,586 --> 00:20:00,188
There's just a chance he
might work out she's a copper.

398
00:20:05,427 --> 00:20:07,162
Excuse me, sergeant, darling,

399
00:20:07,163 --> 00:20:09,731
- May I have a word?
- It's your police station.

400
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:11,733
You can talk to who you like, I suppose.

401
00:20:13,636 --> 00:20:15,070
Yes, well, um...

402
00:20:15,071 --> 00:20:18,140
The point is that I need
another man for my quiz team.

403
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:21,576
And when I say "man," I mean,
of course, "man or person."

404
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:25,346
Now you've got a pretty
good brain, old girl,

405
00:20:25,347 --> 00:20:28,249
Senile dementia not quite
set in yet, I hope, hmm?

406
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,353
You wouldn't be much good
on pop music or fashion,

407
00:20:32,354 --> 00:20:35,924
But I would imagine you'd
play a pretty straight bat

408
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:37,659
When it came to postwar politics

409
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,429
Or matters pertaining to
gardening and plumbing.

410
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,766
- So how about it? - I can't imagine
why you would want another player.

411
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:46,768
After all, you have constable Habib,

412
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:49,604
The finest brain and the
shortest skirt in the force.

413
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:53,975
Yes, there's no doubt that
Habib is an extraordinary woman.

414
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:55,977
But I'm afraid she cannot compete.

415
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:58,213
I have other duties for her.

416
00:20:58,214 --> 00:21:01,016
What other duties,
Raymond? What is going on?!

417
00:21:01,017 --> 00:21:04,252
I'm afraid I cannot tell
you, and that's the end of it.

418
00:21:04,253 --> 00:21:07,222
And anyway, does our
team really need her?

419
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:09,490
She's bright, she's charismatic

420
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:10,892
And she's a natural star,

421
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:13,528
"but is that what we want?" I ask.

422
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:16,164
And I answer, "no."

423
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:19,367
Give me a good, honest, plain, solid,

424
00:21:19,368 --> 00:21:22,738
Workaday team player
like dear old Pat Dawkins.

425
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,373
I wouldn't join your quiz
team if it was the only thing

426
00:21:25,374 --> 00:21:28,676
That stood between you and
disemboweling with a blunt truncheon.

427
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,649
Goody, Gladstone, in the briefing room.

428
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:39,554
Leave the er. Uh, I mean...

429
00:21:39,555 --> 00:21:40,655
Leave it.

430
00:21:42,258 --> 00:21:43,658
All right, you men.

431
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:45,160
I'm going to ask you a question,

432
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:48,230
And I want you to answer
to the best of your ability.

433
00:21:48,231 --> 00:21:50,598
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

434
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:54,970
- Just one question, sir.
- Yes, just the one question, Goody.

435
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:57,973
No, I mean, may I ask a
question about your question?

436
00:21:57,974 --> 00:22:00,408
- Yes, if you must.
- Thank you, sir.

437
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:02,377
Is that the question?

438
00:22:04,213 --> 00:22:05,247
Is what the question?

439
00:22:05,248 --> 00:22:06,614
If we understand.

440
00:22:06,615 --> 00:22:07,816
Understand what?

441
00:22:07,817 --> 00:22:10,218
That you're going to ask us a question.

442
00:22:11,553 --> 00:22:13,588
Is the question whether you understand

443
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:15,791
The fact that I'm going
to ask you a question?

444
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:19,627
Yes, sir. You see, you said you
were going to ask us a question.

445
00:22:19,628 --> 00:22:22,264
And then you asked us if we understood.

446
00:22:22,265 --> 00:22:24,766
Now I was wondering if
that was the question,

447
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:28,369
Or just a sub question, and that
the real question was still to come.

448
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:31,706
Congratulations, Goody, you've just
failed your trial for the quiz team.

449
00:22:31,707 --> 00:22:32,974
- Get out.
- Yes, sir.

450
00:22:35,444 --> 00:22:37,846
I was captain of a pub
quiz side once, sir.

451
00:22:37,847 --> 00:22:40,282
- Were you really?
- Oh yes.

452
00:22:40,283 --> 00:22:43,384
I remember telling the
lads before our first match,

453
00:22:43,385 --> 00:22:47,889
"memory and detail
- let those be our bywords.

454
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:52,027
Memory, memory, memory,
detail, detail, detail."

455
00:22:52,028 --> 00:22:54,562
Excellent advice, Gladstone.
How did your team fare?

456
00:22:54,563 --> 00:22:56,698
I don't know. I forgot
where the pub was, sir.

457
00:22:59,302 --> 00:23:02,570
Sir, you know the name
of our team is called

458
00:23:02,571 --> 00:23:05,140
"Gasforth police station"?

459
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:07,442
Yes, very good.

460
00:23:07,443 --> 00:23:10,946
But I fear the questions are
likely to be slightly more taxing

461
00:23:10,947 --> 00:23:12,848
Than what is the name of your team.

462
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,250
No, I was just thinking,

463
00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:19,120
It doesn't say that the players
actually have to be coppers.

464
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:20,388
Does it, sir?

465
00:23:22,325 --> 00:23:24,159
How far will Fred have to travel

466
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,094
To reach the fire extinguisher?

467
00:23:26,095 --> 00:23:29,130
Uh...

468
00:23:29,131 --> 00:23:30,232
What?

469
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:32,767
Who cares?

470
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:35,603
( vomiting )

471
00:23:35,604 --> 00:23:38,373
I don't think you're trying
hard enough, constable.

472
00:23:38,374 --> 00:23:39,875
Did you show him plenty of leg?

473
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:43,011
Excuse me, if this skirt were
any shorter, it'd be a belt.

474
00:23:43,012 --> 00:23:46,481
Habib, this bloke is a hardened villain.

475
00:23:46,482 --> 00:23:50,285
He's not going to incriminate
himself for a flash of gusset.

476
00:23:50,286 --> 00:23:52,287
You've got to go further. Offer the lot.

477
00:23:52,288 --> 00:23:54,422
- Do what?
- Oh god.

478
00:23:54,423 --> 00:23:56,191
I suppose I'll have to show you.

479
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,361
Constable Kray, you be the Mark.

480
00:23:59,362 --> 00:24:01,662
Now this is how to be sexy.

481
00:24:01,663 --> 00:24:04,032
Of course you've got
to imagine the skirt.

482
00:24:07,937 --> 00:24:09,905
So do you want another drink, love?

483
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,941
Oh I shouldn't really, I
get so randy when I'm tiddly.

484
00:24:12,942 --> 00:24:15,777
All right, go on then, lover.

485
00:24:15,778 --> 00:24:17,045
( laughs )

486
00:24:17,046 --> 00:24:19,614
Give me a big one.

487
00:24:19,615 --> 00:24:21,416
Excuse me...

488
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:24,552
Are we trying to make
him confess or throw up?

489
00:24:25,587 --> 00:24:27,022
Look, inspector Grim,

490
00:24:27,023 --> 00:24:29,857
With all due respect to
your suppressed sexuality,

491
00:24:29,858 --> 00:24:32,327
I haven't got a problem
giving him the come on.

492
00:24:32,328 --> 00:24:34,963
I've been beating him off
with a bottle of brown ale.

493
00:24:34,964 --> 00:24:37,265
It just isn't making
him blab, that's all.

494
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:40,101
You got to make him think you
like sleeping with villains,

495
00:24:40,102 --> 00:24:42,770
- That it turns you on.
- No, I will not have it.

496
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:45,373
That is blatant entrapment.
It is not the job of the police

497
00:24:45,374 --> 00:24:47,275
To provoke people into breaking the law.

498
00:24:47,276 --> 00:24:50,211
You can't provoke them if
they don't want to do it.

499
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:53,048
We've come this far, she's
gotta go the last mile.

500
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:55,216
What do you think, sir?

501
00:24:55,217 --> 00:24:57,485
Soliciting a crime is an offense.

502
00:24:57,486 --> 00:24:59,487
I know, constable, I know.

503
00:24:59,488 --> 00:25:02,123
I utterly deplore
this type of operation.

504
00:25:02,124 --> 00:25:05,660
But we've come this far,

505
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:08,229
And if we can just get
this business over with

506
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:11,299
Before the pub quiz final, then
you can be back on the team.

507
00:25:18,341 --> 00:25:20,775
Well, Habib, you don't look very happy.

508
00:25:20,776 --> 00:25:23,311
What's inspector Fowler
asked you to do now?

509
00:25:23,312 --> 00:25:26,314
He's asking me to go a lot further
than I feel comfortable with.

510
00:25:26,315 --> 00:25:29,050
Personally, I think it's a bit immoral.

511
00:25:29,051 --> 00:25:30,618
And I think he does too.

512
00:25:34,523 --> 00:25:36,992
Heavens and braces, sergeant Dawkins,

513
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,726
Have you run mad?

514
00:25:38,727 --> 00:25:40,495
No, I have not.

515
00:25:40,496 --> 00:25:42,530
I have come to my senses.

516
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:44,732
( laughs )

517
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:48,336
You've destroyed her majesty's crest,

518
00:25:48,337 --> 00:25:51,539
The very symbol of all the
values that I stand for!

519
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,341
You don't stand for any values.

520
00:25:53,342 --> 00:25:55,743
I've seen what you're
doing to constable Habib.

521
00:25:55,744 --> 00:25:57,212
You viper, you rat!

522
00:25:57,213 --> 00:25:59,014
Oh, I see.

523
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,782
So you know about Habib, do you?

524
00:26:01,783 --> 00:26:05,053
- Yes, I do.
- You were right to destroy the crest.

525
00:26:05,054 --> 00:26:06,521
I should never have gone along

526
00:26:06,522 --> 00:26:09,090
With Grim's entrapment
operation in the first place,

527
00:26:09,091 --> 00:26:13,661
Let alone hurry it on so Habib
could rejoin my quiz team.

528
00:26:13,662 --> 00:26:15,263
Entrapment operation?

529
00:26:15,264 --> 00:26:18,166
Well, yes, but
- but you must've known that.

530
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:20,235
That's why you destroyed the crest.

531
00:26:20,236 --> 00:26:23,071
Unless you placed some
other interpretation

532
00:26:23,072 --> 00:26:25,507
Upon my activities with constable Habib?

533
00:26:25,508 --> 00:26:28,410
No, no, no. No, I had the
whole thing worked out.

534
00:26:28,411 --> 00:26:31,979
Short skirts, secret meetings
- entrapment operation.

535
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,016
Plain as day, absolutely.
Knew all along.

536
00:26:35,017 --> 00:26:38,286
I should never have agreed
to Grim's appalling methods.

537
00:26:38,287 --> 00:26:42,190
If I had not, I would
still have my honor,

538
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:43,925
My crest,

539
00:26:43,926 --> 00:26:46,061
And a full quiz team.

540
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,930
As it is, I have nothing.

541
00:26:49,932 --> 00:26:51,933
Dear, oh dear, Raymond.

542
00:26:51,934 --> 00:26:55,970
You don't half go on
with your high and mighty,

543
00:26:55,971 --> 00:26:58,839
Up your jacksy, snooty, snotty,

544
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,642
Dib-dib-dob, excuse
me, scout's honor,

545
00:27:01,643 --> 00:27:05,680
Not bleeding, croquet
load of old cobblers."

546
00:27:05,681 --> 00:27:08,149
I don't suppose when Habib
comes in here with our man,

547
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,318
You'll mind taking half
the credit, will you?

548
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,554
No, you'll be in there
for the glory, won't you?

549
00:27:12,555 --> 00:27:16,091
On the contrary, Derek, I want
no further part of this matter.

550
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:19,294
So the full and complete
credit goes to C.I.D.?

551
00:27:19,295 --> 00:27:21,396
The whole thing is mine?

552
00:27:21,397 --> 00:27:23,831
I shall hold you to that, Raymond.

553
00:27:23,832 --> 00:27:25,700
Oh yes, oh yes.

554
00:27:29,505 --> 00:27:32,139
Evening, Mr. Grim. Evening, Mr. Fowler.

555
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,476
Well, well, well.

556
00:27:34,477 --> 00:27:36,378
Terry the tank.

557
00:27:37,713 --> 00:27:39,681
It seems an arrest
has been made already.

558
00:27:39,682 --> 00:27:41,215
Well done, constable.

559
00:27:41,216 --> 00:27:44,285
I shall handle this, Raymond. As agreed.

560
00:27:44,286 --> 00:27:46,320
Sir, I don't think you understand.

561
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:49,357
She hasn't arrested
me. I've arrested her.

562
00:27:49,358 --> 00:27:53,094
On a citizen's arrest.
Greedy little copper tart!

563
00:27:53,095 --> 00:27:55,162
Here I was trying to get me leg over,

564
00:27:55,163 --> 00:27:58,466
And all she's interested
in is my pump action.

565
00:27:58,467 --> 00:28:00,101
Entrapment, that's what this is.

566
00:28:00,102 --> 00:28:02,804
I want to make a very serious complaint.

567
00:28:02,805 --> 00:28:05,473
Inspector Grim, I
believe you were anxious

568
00:28:05,474 --> 00:28:08,209
To take full and complete
credit for this operation.

569
00:28:10,145 --> 00:28:11,446
Now's your chance.

570
00:28:12,882 --> 00:28:15,082
I love you.

571
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,317
You know that, don't you?

572
00:28:16,318 --> 00:28:19,253
I love you, I love you, I love you.

573
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:21,756
You're all I've ever wanted.

574
00:28:21,757 --> 00:28:23,792
Holding you like this in my arms

575
00:28:23,793 --> 00:28:26,928
Makes me the happiest man in the world.

576
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:29,263
But then you know that, don't you?

577
00:28:29,264 --> 00:28:32,333
And I'll never ever let you go.

578
00:28:32,334 --> 00:28:33,535
Shut up, Raymond.

579
00:28:33,536 --> 00:28:36,471
