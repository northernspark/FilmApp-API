00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,042
Your daughter is here, Mr. Wynant.

3
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:18,632
Mr. Wynant.

4
00:01:19,526 --> 00:01:20,699
Mr. Wynant.

5
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:24,959
Haven't you got any more sense
than to shout at me like that?

6
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:27,682
- I'm sorry, but...
- Two weeks' work gone for nothing!

7
00:01:27,782 --> 00:01:30,040
- I just wanted to tell you...
- I don't care!

8
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,080
Get your things and get out!
You're through!

9
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,678
- Yes, I'm going.
- Get out!

10
00:01:33,779 --> 00:01:36,838
It's a good thing I'm going away.
No peace, no quiet.

11
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:38,322
Everybody interrupting me.

12
00:01:38,422 --> 00:01:41,291
- Can I come in? Did you tell him?
- I didn't get a chance.

13
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:42,893
Dad.

14
00:01:43,057 --> 00:01:45,357
Why didn't somebody
tell me you were here?

15
00:01:45,457 --> 00:01:49,598
I'm sorry to interrupt your work, darling.
Look at you. But this really is important.

16
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:50,879
How are you?

17
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,958
- Another young man?
- It's the same one.

18
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:55,278
It's been the same one for three months.

19
00:01:55,378 --> 00:01:57,358
- Forgive me. How are you?
- How do you do?

20
00:01:57,458 --> 00:02:02,049
Take a good look at him, Dad,
and try to remember him, because...

21
00:02:03,053 --> 00:02:04,805
he's going to be your son-in-law.

22
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:07,999
- That is, if it's all right with you, sir.
- And if it isn't?

23
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:10,201
He's still going to be your son-in-law.

24
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:12,278
You see how much we have to say.

25
00:02:12,378 --> 00:02:16,446
But, Dad, this is really what
I wanted to talk to you about.

26
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:19,359
- Do you mind if I look around?
- Help yourself.

27
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,720
Tom, show this...

28
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,121
- Where are you going?
- Home.

29
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:23,479
- Home?
- I'm fired.

30
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,245
- Who fired you?
- You did.

31
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,962
Forget it.
Will you show this gentleman around?

32
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:31,362
- Yes, right this way, sir.
- Thank you.

33
00:02:32,293 --> 00:02:34,358
Dad, Mother's planning
on a big church wedding.

34
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,560
Yeah, she would.

35
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,001
I hate all that fuss.
But I'll do it on one condition...

36
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:41,440
that you're there to give me away, darling.

37
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,402
- What would your mother say to that?
- It's my wedding, isn't it?

38
00:02:44,502 --> 00:02:47,405
But wouldn't it be embarrassing,
all of us there...

39
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:50,411
- your mother and me, your stepfather?
- He can stay home.

40
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:51,998
Please, Daddy, won't you?

41
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:54,078
- If you think it will be all right.
- You lamb.

42
00:02:54,178 --> 00:02:55,598
Now, wait a minute.

43
00:02:55,698 --> 00:02:57,880
When is it gonna be?
I'm leaving town tonight.

44
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,240
Where are you going?

45
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,478
That's a secret.
I can't even tell you, my dear.

46
00:03:01,578 --> 00:03:03,601
I've got an important idea to work on.

47
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:05,038
What is it, a new invention?

48
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,357
Yes, and I don't want somebody to steal it
from me.

49
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,082
But we were planning
on being married right after Christmas.

50
00:03:10,182 --> 00:03:11,562
I'll be home before Christmas.

51
00:03:11,662 --> 00:03:13,840
- Is that a promise?
- That's a promise I won't forget.

52
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,811
- All right!
- Where's MacCaulay? It's time I started.

53
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:19,563
- How's your brother?
- He's all right.

54
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:22,559
I'd like to see him.
Why don't you bring him down?

55
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:25,638
You know how it is, Daddy.
He's sort of under Mother's thumb.

56
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,086
Yes, I know.

57
00:03:27,813 --> 00:03:30,522
You're not missing much. He's cuckoo.

58
00:03:30,622 --> 00:03:32,162
Like all the rest of us?

59
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:35,723
Has this fellow...
Has he seen the whole family?

60
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:38,613
Yes, and he still wants to marry me.

61
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,201
- He's a brave man.
- Yes.

62
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:42,602
Thanks a lot, old man.

63
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:45,439
- You have an interesting plant here.
- Didn't I tell you?

64
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:48,278
I didn't know you invented
that smelting process, Mr. Wynant.

65
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:51,162
This is the first metal that came through,
three kinds of ore:

66
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:53,398
Gold, silver, copper.

67
00:03:53,498 --> 00:03:54,919
Isn't that interesting?

68
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,802
- Daddy, does that still bother you?
- Only in bad weather.

69
00:03:57,902 --> 00:04:01,320
- It isn't bad weather now.
- You better get home before it is.

70
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,122
All right. Goodbye, darling,
and don't forget, December 30.

71
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,922
- Goodbye, boy.
- Goodbye.

72
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:09,844
Take good care of Dorothy.

73
00:04:10,173 --> 00:04:12,760
Show her that there is such a thing
as a happy marriage.

74
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,519
I'll do my best, Mr. Wynant.

75
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:16,082
- Goodbye, sweetie.
- Goodbye, dear.

76
00:04:16,182 --> 00:04:17,359
Is it all settled?

77
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,559
Grand.

78
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,036
Why did your mother divorce him?
I think he's swell.

79
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:24,842
- It seems he has a secretary.
- I'll do my own typing.

80
00:04:29,173 --> 00:04:31,846
Dad's a good barometer. Here's a taxi.

81
00:04:37,413 --> 00:04:39,361
- Hello, Mr. MacCaulay.
- How are you?

82
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:41,639
- Get under this.
- No, we're taking your cab.

83
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,559
- Is your father still in there?
- Yes, he's waiting for you.

84
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,203
- Did he tell you where he was going?
- He wouldn't say.

85
00:04:47,303 --> 00:04:49,124
- Goodbye, Miss Wynant.
- Goodbye.

86
00:04:49,253 --> 00:04:50,396
Here's your change, boss.

87
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:52,718
You wouldn't drive slowly,
so you don't get a tip.

88
00:04:52,818 --> 00:04:55,201
That's okay, sweetheart, I got it anyway.

89
00:05:03,973 --> 00:05:06,602
- Mr. Wynant.
- Hello there. Did you get my money?

90
00:05:06,702 --> 00:05:09,918
- I wish you'd tell me where you're going.
- I'm not telling anyone.

91
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,599
Suppose some business should come up?

92
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,242
That's just why I'm going.

93
00:05:13,342 --> 00:05:15,962
There's $100, $200, $300...

94
00:05:16,062 --> 00:05:18,681
- Here, never mind.
- I wish you'd count it.

95
00:05:18,781 --> 00:05:21,237
- There's $1,000 there.
- I trust you.

96
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:24,761
Isn't there anything else I can do for you?
Have you bought your ticket?

97
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:26,918
- No.
- Let me do that for you.

98
00:05:27,018 --> 00:05:30,281
Yes, you might do that.
You might get me a ticket for...

99
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:31,692
No, you don't.

100
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,561
Thanks and goodbye.

101
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:36,399
What'll I do if something comes up?

102
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:38,839
Settle it yourself.
What have I got a lawyer for?

103
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,482
- Is Julia going with you?
- No.

104
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:43,362
- What if you need more money?
- I've left instructions with Julia.

105
00:05:43,462 --> 00:05:45,401
She'll get it from you. Goodbye.

106
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:47,079
You don't tell me a thing.

107
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:50,477
I don't know where you're going,
I don't know when you're coming back.

108
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:53,849
I don't know how to reach you
if any business comes up.

109
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:04,961
- Hello, Tanner.
- Mr. Wynant.

110
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:07,603
My daughter's going to be married,
Tanner.

111
00:06:07,703 --> 00:06:10,605
Nice young man. She just brought him in.

112
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:13,329
Congratulations.

113
00:06:14,412 --> 00:06:16,608
I'm gonna make her a wedding present.

114
00:06:16,813 --> 00:06:20,009
Thought I'd better do it now
before I forget it.

115
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:23,443
I can drop them on the way...

116
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:28,926
That's funny.

117
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:32,961
- Where are those bonds?
- Bonds, sir?

118
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:34,559
I know I put them in there.

119
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:36,564
Maybe Miss Wolf has them, sir.

120
00:06:37,253 --> 00:06:40,245
Yes, maybe she has.

121
00:06:41,253 --> 00:06:42,642
- Joe?
- Yeah.

122
00:06:42,742 --> 00:06:45,088
- How do you like yours?
- Straight.

123
00:06:51,852 --> 00:06:54,606
You women sure take a lot of punishment.

124
00:07:03,493 --> 00:07:04,919
You're in the wrong place, buddy.

125
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:06,019
Am I?

126
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:07,759
What's on your mind? What do you want?

127
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:10,811
- Who is it, Joe?
- That's what I want to know.

128
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:15,164
- We're just having a little drink.
- Yeah, so I see.

129
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:19,640
See you later, Joe.

130
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,964
Sorry, didn't know I was talking
to the boyfriend.

131
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:28,088
- So long.
- So long, Joe.

132
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:31,438
Who's that man?

133
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:33,996
He isn't anybody.
Just a fellow I used to know.

134
00:07:34,097 --> 00:07:36,078
I thought you'd given up
that sort of friend.

135
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:38,397
It's the first time I've seen him in years.

136
00:07:38,498 --> 00:07:40,638
I didn't want him to think
I was high-hatting him.

137
00:07:40,738 --> 00:07:42,798
You know how I feel
about that sort of thing.

138
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:45,646
Don't worry. You won't see him again.

139
00:07:46,373 --> 00:07:48,757
Tell me, did you change your mind
about going?

140
00:07:48,857 --> 00:07:50,961
No, I just came back for a second.

141
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:53,442
I want to get those bonds.

142
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:55,244
Bonds?

143
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:58,159
What bonds?

144
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,928
The government bonds.
The ones you took from the office safe.

145
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,731
Oh, yes.

146
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:06,198
You told me to sell those a long time ago.

147
00:08:06,298 --> 00:08:09,242
I'd never tell you to sell those.
I bought those for my daughter.

148
00:08:09,342 --> 00:08:11,998
- Don't you remember?
- See here, Julia...

149
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:14,962
you're counting too much
on my absent-mindedness.

150
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:17,681
You've been taking a little
here and there for some time...

151
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:19,598
without my saying anything about it.

152
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:22,160
But this is $50,000.

153
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:24,282
Do you realize you're accusing me...

154
00:08:24,382 --> 00:08:26,358
No one else had
the combination to that safe.

155
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,401
You took them.
What did you do with them?

156
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:29,557
What if I did take them?

157
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:32,877
I'm tired of seeing you hand out
thousands of dollars to your family.

158
00:08:32,977 --> 00:08:34,037
That's my business.

159
00:08:34,137 --> 00:08:36,879
Supporting a gang of loafers
that don't care a darn about you.

160
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:39,718
A wife that kicked you out
the first time your foot slipped.

161
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,958
None of them would help you.
And I've given my whole life to you.

162
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:46,241
If you kicked off tomorrow,
where would I be? Out in the gutter.

163
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:48,520
Certainly I took those bonds.
Who has a better right?

164
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,120
I want that money now,
or I'll hand you over to the police.

165
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,487
Go ahead!

166
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:56,040
They'll be pretty rough with you,
with your record.

167
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:59,240
That's a fine thing to say to me
after what I've been to you.

168
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,846
Hello, give me...

169
00:09:05,013 --> 00:09:06,013
Well?

170
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,772
All right, I'll give it to you.

171
00:09:13,573 --> 00:09:15,159
$25,000, that's all I've got.

172
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:16,839
You're gonna return every cent of it.

173
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:18,157
I can't! I haven't got it!

174
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,238
- What did you do with the rest?
- I never had it.

175
00:09:20,338 --> 00:09:23,405
Then there was someone in with you.
Who was it?

176
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:26,291
I'll answer that.

177
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,484
Hello.

178
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:45,689
You don't need to tell me.

179
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:48,049
I have a pretty good idea.

180
00:09:49,773 --> 00:09:51,843
What are you going to do?

181
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:32,198
Honey, stop worrying about your father.
He'll turn up all right.

182
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,277
Yes, but, Tommy, today is Christmas Eve.

183
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:37,118
He's just forgotten.
You know how he forgets everything.

184
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,118
No, he never forgets a promise to me.

185
00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:41,640
I'm worried.
I know something's happened to him.

186
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,248
What could happen to him, darling?
Will you stop worrying?

187
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:56,402
You see,
the important thing is the rhythm.

188
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:59,361
You should always have rhythm
in your shaking.

189
00:10:59,462 --> 00:11:01,917
A Manhattan you shake to a foxtrot.

190
00:11:02,017 --> 00:11:04,839
A Bronx to two-step time.

191
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:08,687
The dry martini
you always shake to waltz time.

192
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:24,450
- What is it?
- Just a minute.

193
00:11:25,413 --> 00:11:28,042
Now, mind you,
there's a still more modern trend...

194
00:11:28,142 --> 00:11:30,001
Let me have... Thank you.

195
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:31,765
Certain people have...

196
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,770
- Hello, there.
- Hello.

197
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:37,759
Another glass. How are you?

198
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,279
You know, we do know each other.

199
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:41,922
Of course we do.
We've known each other for years.

200
00:11:42,022 --> 00:11:44,238
- Aren't you Nick Charles?
- Yes.

201
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:46,972
You don't remember me.
I'm Dorothy Wynant.

202
00:11:47,413 --> 00:11:50,202
- Not that scrawny, little bit of...
- Yes.

203
00:11:50,302 --> 00:11:51,799
How did you ever remember me?

204
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,681
You used to fascinate me,
a real live detective.

205
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:57,678
You used to tell me the most
wonderful stories. Were they true?

206
00:11:57,778 --> 00:11:59,322
Probably not.

207
00:11:59,422 --> 00:12:00,557
Tommy, this is Nick Charles.

208
00:12:00,657 --> 00:12:02,041
- Hi, Tommy.
- How do you do?

209
00:12:02,142 --> 00:12:05,082
- Let's have another glass.
- He once worked on a case for my father.

210
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,760
Yeah, some nut wanted to kill him.
How is your father?

211
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,721
That's what I came to ask you.
He's disappeared.

212
00:12:10,821 --> 00:12:13,682
Now, don't say that, darling.
He's just away somewhere working.

213
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:16,838
I can't find him. I've tried everything.
I thought you might know.

214
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:19,961
I don't know anything. I've been
in California for the last four years.

215
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:22,719
What about his lawyer?
Used to be some bird by the name of...

216
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:25,196
- MacCaulay?
- Herbert MacCaulay.

217
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:27,719
- I've tried him once.
- Why don't you try him again?

218
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:29,318
- All right.
- Here's a nickel.

219
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:31,290
Thank you. I'll be right back.

220
00:12:32,773 --> 00:12:35,119
You know, she's got me worrying, too.

221
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:39,252
You mustn't worry about him.
Mind you, he's a great guy, but screwy.

222
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,482
Madam, I'm very sorry, but no dogs.

223
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:49,358
You cannot take your dog in there.

224
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,728
I'm not taking him, he's taking me.

225
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,078
- Are you hurt, madam?
- No.

226
00:12:55,178 --> 00:12:57,281
Women and children first, boys.

227
00:12:57,381 --> 00:12:59,240
What is the score, anyway?

228
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:02,558
- So it's you he was after!
- Hello, sugar.

229
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,920
He's dragged me
into every gin mill on the block.

230
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,280
- I had him out this morning.
- I thought so.

231
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,996
- This is Tommy. My wife.
- How do you do?

232
00:13:11,097 --> 00:13:13,961
I don't usually look like this.
I've been Christmas shopping.

233
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:18,162
- I'm afraid we shall take the dog out.
- It's all right, Joe. It's my dog.

234
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:19,721
And my wife.

235
00:13:19,821 --> 00:13:21,999
You might have mentioned me first
on the billing.

236
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,918
The dog's well-trained,
he'll behave himself.

237
00:13:24,018 --> 00:13:25,120
It might bite somebody.

238
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,681
No, he's all right. Look. Lie down!

239
00:13:30,973 --> 00:13:32,325
Stand up!

240
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:37,000
- Any luck?
- Yes, he's just around the corner.

241
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,997
- Your father?
- No, MacCaulay.

242
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:40,917
I'm just going to go and see him.

243
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:43,041
My wife. This is Dorothy Wynant.

244
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:44,719
How do you do?
I'm sorry we have to rush.

245
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:46,681
We're stopping at the Normandie
for a couple weeks.

246
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:47,837
Drop around and see us.

247
00:13:47,937 --> 00:13:50,652
- We'd love to. Thank you. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

248
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:52,522
Sit down, sugar.

249
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:54,251
- Leo.
- Yes, sir?

250
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,692
Two cocktails.

251
00:13:58,533 --> 00:13:59,719
Pretty girl.

252
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,203
- Yes. She's a very nice type.
- You've got types?

253
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:07,692
Only you, darling.
Lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.

254
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:11,442
Compliments of the season.

255
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:12,959
Who is she?

256
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:15,842
Darling, I was hoping
I wouldn't have to answer that.

257
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:17,207
Come on.

258
00:14:17,653 --> 00:14:20,441
Dorothy is really my daughter.

259
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:23,599
You see, it was spring in Venice,
and I was so young...

260
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:25,561
I didn't know what I was doing.

261
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:28,239
We're all like that on my father's side.

262
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,797
- By the way, how is your father's side?
- It's much better, and yours?

263
00:14:31,898 --> 00:14:33,645
How many drinks have you had?

264
00:14:33,893 --> 00:14:36,123
This will make six martinis.

265
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:39,279
All right, will you bring me
five more martinis?

266
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,442
- Leo, line them right up here!
- Yes, ma'am.

267
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:52,322
What hit me?

268
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:53,801
The last martini.

269
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:56,361
- How about a little pick-me-up?
- No.

270
00:14:58,293 --> 00:14:59,480
I can't lie here.

271
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,770
I've got to get up and trim
that darn Christmas tree.

272
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:06,488
What's the idea of pushing me?

273
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,082
Who's that?

274
00:15:09,182 --> 00:15:10,731
Probably Santa Claus.

275
00:15:14,653 --> 00:15:17,000
- How are you?
- Hello, MacCaulay. Come in.

276
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,962
Dorothy told me you were here.
I was going to telephone, but...

277
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:22,480
That's all right. Sit down, won't you?

278
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,477
- What are you drinking?
- Nothing, thanks.

279
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:25,962
That's a mistake.

280
00:15:26,062 --> 00:15:29,363
I wanted to see you.
What's Mimi up to, Mr. Charles?

281
00:15:30,653 --> 00:15:31,840
Dorothy's mother.

282
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,397
- Does she have to be up to something?
- She usually is.

283
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:36,957
Trying one way or another
to get money out of Wynant.

284
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:41,162
I wanted to find out
if you were sleuthing for her.

285
00:15:41,262 --> 00:15:43,998
- I haven't been a detective in four years.
- Is that so?

286
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:47,839
My wife's father died
and left her a narrow gauge railway...

287
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:49,730
and a lumber mill and...

288
00:15:50,453 --> 00:15:52,960
several other things.
I'm taking care of them.

289
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,356
Say, what's the fuss about?
Is he in hiding?

290
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:58,721
You know as much about it as I do.
I haven't seen him in three months.

291
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:00,000
No word at all?

292
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,361
He sends word through his secretary,
Julia Wolf, when he wants money.

293
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:05,916
I give it to her and she gives it to him.

294
00:16:06,016 --> 00:16:07,526
That's still on?

295
00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:10,651
Excuse me.

296
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:12,004
Hello?

297
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,319
Just a minute.

298
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:15,722
For you.

299
00:16:15,822 --> 00:16:18,088
Is there a Mr. MacCaulay in the house?

300
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:19,677
Pardon me.

301
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:21,729
Yes? Just a moment.

302
00:16:22,093 --> 00:16:23,317
My wife.

303
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,324
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

304
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,929
What were you saying?

305
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:31,285
He is? Where is he now?

306
00:16:32,373 --> 00:16:33,852
Very well.

307
00:16:35,573 --> 00:16:36,797
Excuse us.

308
00:16:36,897 --> 00:16:39,282
He's back in town. Wynant.

309
00:16:40,253 --> 00:16:41,838
Yes. He's waiting for me now.

310
00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:44,919
Forgive me, Mrs. Charles,
but I've been so upset.

311
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:48,281
You know,
it's no joke working for a man like that...

312
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:50,197
I guess I'd better be off.

313
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:52,560
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

314
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,802
Goodbye.

315
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,398
- Merry Christmas.
- Same to you.

316
00:16:57,498 --> 00:17:00,601
The next person that says
"Merry Christmas" to me, I'll kill him!

317
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:02,721
I'm going to telephone that poor child.

318
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,850
At least she'll be glad to know
that he's alive.

319
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:07,653
Asta.

320
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:18,444
Hello?

321
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:22,530
How are you?

322
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,321
I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now.

323
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:28,361
Dorothy? No, she isn't here.
Is it something about her father?

324
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:30,678
Perhaps I can take the message.

325
00:17:30,778 --> 00:17:33,003
Here she is now.

326
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:35,076
Hello.

327
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:37,084
I just wanted to relieve your mind.

328
00:17:37,533 --> 00:17:39,364
He's alive and he's all right.

329
00:17:39,532 --> 00:17:40,879
Thank goodness!

330
00:17:40,979 --> 00:17:42,682
What is it? Has he found him?

331
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:44,728
Do you know where he's living?

332
00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:48,041
At least I'm glad he's all right.

333
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:50,400
Thank you for calling. Goodbye.

334
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,759
- What is it?
- Nothing.

335
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,403
That isn't true. It's something
about your father. Where is he?

336
00:17:55,503 --> 00:17:57,397
- He's all right, isn't that enough?
- No.

337
00:17:57,498 --> 00:17:59,877
You just want money and
you haven't any right to any more.

338
00:17:59,977 --> 00:18:01,441
He made a big settlement on you.

339
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,438
That's gone long ago. I've got to find him!
Where is he?

340
00:18:04,538 --> 00:18:06,480
I won't have you hounding him
for any more money!

341
00:18:06,581 --> 00:18:07,680
I can tell you, Mother.

342
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,561
You've been listening
on the extension again!

343
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:11,041
Of course. What's an extension for?

344
00:18:11,141 --> 00:18:14,321
That's right, Gilbert.
Tell Mother. What did he say?

345
00:18:14,421 --> 00:18:17,041
He said Father's in town.
He's been seeing Julia right along.

346
00:18:17,142 --> 00:18:19,000
- That woman!
- She can tell you where Father is.

347
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,839
You couldn't do that.
You wouldn't go to her.

348
00:18:20,939 --> 00:18:23,961
I didn't say I would,
but we've got to have money.

349
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,442
Did it ever occur to you
that Chris might work?

350
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,288
Now you've hurt his feelings.

351
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:42,850
You know, you have an Oedipus complex
and you won't admit it.

352
00:18:42,973 --> 00:18:45,799
- Please, Gilbert.
- Your trouble is you won't face facts.

353
00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:48,357
I know I have a mother fixation,
but it's slight.

354
00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:51,650
- It hasn't yet reached the point of where...
- Stop it, Gilbert!

355
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:55,878
Don't mind what she says, Chris.

356
00:18:55,978 --> 00:18:57,362
How can I help but mind?

357
00:18:57,462 --> 00:18:59,880
I'm constantly humiliated
because I haven't money.

358
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,567
- I'll get some.
- You've said that for weeks.

359
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:05,679
Why don't you see Julia?
She handles his money.

360
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,082
All right.

361
00:19:07,182 --> 00:19:09,637
- I couldn't go near that woman.
- I said all right.

362
00:19:09,737 --> 00:19:12,522
- Chris, what are you going to do?
- Just what I said I'd do!

363
00:19:12,622 --> 00:19:15,730
- You wouldn't do that.
- Wouldn't I? Just watch me.

364
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:43,241
Get me Miss Wolf
at the Clarkson Apartments.

365
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,083
Hello? Miss Wolf?

366
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:48,490
This is Mrs. Jorgensen...

367
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:51,372
<i>- I wonder if I may see you?</i>
- Yes, of course.

368
00:19:51,653 --> 00:19:52,927
<i>Thank you.</i>

369
00:20:01,853 --> 00:20:04,128
- Miss Wolf's apartment, please.
- 9A.

370
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,721
Who's calling, please?

371
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:08,373
Never mind, Miss Wolf is expecting me.

372
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,686
Miss Wolf.

373
00:21:28,213 --> 00:21:31,001
Quick!
Send somebody up here right away!

374
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:33,004
Something terrible has happened!

375
00:21:33,413 --> 00:21:36,362
- Julia Wolf, 145 West 55th Street.
- That's me!

376
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,517
Here you are.

377
00:21:37,617 --> 00:21:39,126
- What is it?
- Woman murdered.

378
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:47,172
Where you been?

379
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,641
- Out making money.
- Let's see it.

380
00:21:49,773 --> 00:21:53,128
I haven't got it yet but I'll get it.

381
00:21:56,293 --> 00:21:58,198
Come on, girls, give out.

382
00:21:58,298 --> 00:22:00,932
Shake the bodies a little. Get the rhythm.

383
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:07,878
Keep it up. I can't hear any rhythm.
Come on, shake your feet.

384
00:22:07,979 --> 00:22:09,240
Hello, Morelli.

385
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,766
Hi, Studsy.

386
00:22:13,093 --> 00:22:15,084
Didn't you know Julia Wolf?

387
00:22:16,653 --> 00:22:18,405
Yeah. Why?

388
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:23,925
Somebody just bumped her off.
I thought maybe you'd like to know.

389
00:22:26,773 --> 00:22:28,598
- Yes?
<i>- Telephone, Mr. MacCaulay.</i>

390
00:22:28,698 --> 00:22:30,604
- Who is it?
<i>- The police.</i>

391
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:33,484
Hello?

392
00:22:34,893 --> 00:22:36,042
Murdered?

393
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:39,493
Yes, I'll be right over.

394
00:22:40,332 --> 00:22:43,202
- What are you gonna tell them?
- I'm gonna tell them everything!

395
00:22:43,302 --> 00:22:46,038
- You don't think Mr. Wynant...
- I don't think anything...

396
00:22:46,138 --> 00:22:48,278
but I heard an awful fight in there
a while ago.

397
00:22:48,378 --> 00:22:51,285
- All right, girls.
- Yes, sir. Come on.

398
00:22:51,813 --> 00:22:54,038
When was the last time
you gave her money for Wynant?

399
00:22:54,138 --> 00:22:55,842
Yesterday. I gave her $1,000.

400
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:57,518
- Seen any signs of that, Bill?
- No.

401
00:22:57,619 --> 00:22:58,677
Perhaps it was a robbery.

402
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:01,642
And her with that sparkler on her finger,
and $30 in her purse?

403
00:23:01,742 --> 00:23:05,001
Looks to me like Wynant came to collect
and ran into a little trouble.

404
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:07,238
They haven't seen him downstairs
in three months.

405
00:23:07,338 --> 00:23:09,478
There's a lot they don't see
around this place.

406
00:23:09,578 --> 00:23:11,159
You haven't seen or heard from him?

407
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:12,360
I said he hadn't written me.

408
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,460
Then you've heard from him.

409
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,560
- Well...
- Well what?

410
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,760
- He telephoned me today.
- He did?

411
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,677
I wasn't in.
My secretary took the message.

412
00:23:17,778 --> 00:23:19,561
He left word for me
to meet him at the Plaza.

413
00:23:19,661 --> 00:23:20,999
- What time was that?
- About 3:00.

414
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,243
- Did you go?
- Yes, but he didn't show up.

415
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:27,730
His house and shop are closed,
and he ain't at any hotel.

416
00:23:27,853 --> 00:23:30,482
So, you seen your duty
and you done it, huh?

417
00:23:30,582 --> 00:23:32,529
You gonna stop at that?

418
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:34,757
No, sir.

419
00:23:34,857 --> 00:23:37,199
I know he'll turn up
when he sees this in the papers.

420
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:40,162
You can't think he did it.
He's not the kind of man...

421
00:23:40,262 --> 00:23:42,803
Do you know what they fought about
that night he went away?

422
00:23:42,903 --> 00:23:44,690
I didn't know they had a fight.

423
00:23:45,053 --> 00:23:48,204
Thanks. We'll get in touch with you
when we need you again.

424
00:23:48,973 --> 00:23:51,118
- Can I go?
- Yeah, go ahead.

425
00:23:51,218 --> 00:23:53,044
Mr. Guild? Come here.

426
00:23:53,893 --> 00:23:56,282
Here's something very interesting.

427
00:23:57,733 --> 00:23:59,920
There she was lying on the floor, dead.

428
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,678
The police said she'd been killed
about 10 minutes before I got there.

429
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:04,322
I thought you weren't going there.

430
00:24:04,422 --> 00:24:05,721
- You said...
- Never mind.

431
00:24:05,822 --> 00:24:08,601
Did they find any clues?
A gun or fingerprints or anything?

432
00:24:08,702 --> 00:24:10,640
- Not a thing.
- Was there much blood?

433
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:12,079
Gilbert, don't be so horrible!

434
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:13,918
Nonsense, she got just what she deserved.

435
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,481
- Did you kill her?
- Gilbert!

436
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:17,202
Why not?
You had a perfectly good motive.

437
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:19,640
I hope you won't talk like that
when the police get here.

438
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,399
You said they'd finished with you.

439
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:23,122
They said they'd finished for the present.

440
00:24:23,222 --> 00:24:26,959
I've got my alibi, I was at
the public library. Where were you?

441
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:31,002
Children, I want to speak to Chris alone.
Will you go into the next room?

442
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,438
I'll go.

443
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:34,251
I'll be in my room.

444
00:24:36,253 --> 00:24:39,051
- Is Mrs. Jorgensen in?
- Yes, come right in.

445
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:43,318
Mrs. Jorgensen,
there are a few points I'd like to clear up.

446
00:24:43,418 --> 00:24:46,610
- Yes, won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

447
00:24:52,853 --> 00:24:56,839
You were in the room with the body
from the time it was found until we came?

448
00:24:56,939 --> 00:24:58,076
Why, yes.

449
00:24:58,177 --> 00:24:59,765
Did you...

450
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,079
Did you see anything in Miss Wolf's hand?

451
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:03,179
No.

452
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,519
Are you sure that at no time
you left the room for a moment...

453
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:10,280
that a maid or bellboy mightn't have
slipped in and been alone with the body?

454
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,719
I don't think so.

455
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:14,885
You see, I was so upset,
I hardly knew what I was doing.

456
00:25:15,693 --> 00:25:18,253
The medical examiner seems to think...

457
00:25:19,413 --> 00:25:21,280
that the body had been touched.

458
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:24,837
That someone had forced open
the girl's hand after she'd been killed.

459
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:29,403
Moreover, we found that she had
in her possession $1,000 the night before.

460
00:25:29,973 --> 00:25:31,531
I'm sorry I can't help you.

461
00:25:32,693 --> 00:25:35,730
That's quite all right. We'll be going along.

462
00:25:37,093 --> 00:25:38,759
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

463
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:40,172
Goodbye.

464
00:25:44,053 --> 00:25:46,640
Could I come and see the body?
I've never seen a dead body.

465
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,957
Why do you want to?

466
00:25:48,057 --> 00:25:50,762
I'm studying psychopathic criminology
and I have a theory.

467
00:25:50,862 --> 00:25:53,801
Perhaps this was the work
of a sadist or a paranoiac.

468
00:25:53,902 --> 00:25:56,921
If I saw it, I might be able to tell.

469
00:25:57,021 --> 00:25:58,519
Yeah, that's a good idea.

470
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:02,970
But don't you bother to come down.
We'll bring the body right up to you!

471
00:26:17,293 --> 00:26:18,682
What have you got there?

472
00:26:18,782 --> 00:26:20,598
None of your business.

473
00:26:20,698 --> 00:26:22,757
- You took that money from her hand.
- I didn't.

474
00:26:22,857 --> 00:26:23,997
Then what are you hiding?

475
00:26:24,097 --> 00:26:26,477
A piece of evidence
worth a great deal more than that.

476
00:26:26,577 --> 00:26:29,239
- Hand it over to the police.
- I'll do nothing of the sort.

477
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,961
- Very well, then, I will.
- I don't think you will.

478
00:26:32,061 --> 00:26:33,682
It's your father's.

479
00:26:33,782 --> 00:26:35,843
I don't believe you. You're lying!

480
00:26:37,093 --> 00:26:38,243
There!

481
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:42,804
Now, will you believe me?

482
00:26:43,773 --> 00:26:46,758
After all, I can look at a pretty girl,
can't I?

483
00:26:46,858 --> 00:26:49,321
I mean, it's not against the rules
that I can't admire them.

484
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:51,207
Ammunition?

485
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:54,320
- Come on, stock up.
- No. Let this one ride.

486
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,638
- You better, hard times may get you.
- Who are these amazing people?

487
00:26:57,738 --> 00:27:01,081
Just a lot of old friends.
Romans, countrymen, what do you say?

488
00:27:01,181 --> 00:27:04,239
It's like old times. Remember the fun
we had when we were flat broke?

489
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:06,158
- Don't I?
- Those were the good old days.

490
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:08,398
Don't kid yourself.
These are the good old days.

491
00:27:08,498 --> 00:27:10,638
I think your wife is great!

492
00:27:10,738 --> 00:27:14,486
Thanks, I wanted you to see her,
and I wanted her to see you.

493
00:27:15,653 --> 00:27:19,239
Want to buy a piece of this pug?
I'll sell you 25% of him for $5,000.

494
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,200
- Is he good?
- He's knocking them cold lately.

495
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,799
Ain't afraid of nobody.
Put that down or I'll slug you.

496
00:27:23,899 --> 00:27:25,362
I'll take a large piece of him.

497
00:27:25,462 --> 00:27:27,603
- Having a good time?
- Swell.

498
00:27:28,652 --> 00:27:29,999
Here's that man again.

499
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,323
Ammunition? Very welcome.

500
00:27:33,893 --> 00:27:37,080
Highballs and cocktails.
The long and short of it.

501
00:27:37,181 --> 00:27:39,802
That's a pun.
And punsters should be punished.

502
00:27:39,902 --> 00:27:42,522
<i>For tomorrow may bring sorrow</i>

503
00:27:42,622 --> 00:27:46,128
<i>So tonight let us be gay</i>

504
00:27:46,693 --> 00:27:47,916
More cocktails?

505
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:49,526
Thank you very much.

506
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:53,959
I certainly think your husband's great.

507
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:56,009
I'm glad somebody does.

508
00:28:02,453 --> 00:28:05,411
- Have a cocktail?
- Thanks. Nick Charles here?

509
00:28:05,613 --> 00:28:07,598
- You're his wife?
- Yes. Hey, Nick.

510
00:28:07,698 --> 00:28:09,960
Nice guy. Sent me up the river one time.
Hi, Nick.

511
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,060
Hello, Face.

512
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,198
- Long time, no see.
- Long time.

513
00:28:13,298 --> 00:28:15,720
- I needed the rest.
- Was he a good detective?

514
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,240
I wouldn't know.
The time he caught me was an accident.

515
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,281
- I led with my right.
- Come on, shed the <i>chapeau.</i>

516
00:28:21,381 --> 00:28:24,400
Divest yourself of raiment
and join the Yuletide revelers.

517
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:25,839
Hey, revelers.

518
00:28:25,939 --> 00:28:29,721
I want you to know Face Peppler.
All you got to do is find out who they are.

519
00:28:34,293 --> 00:28:37,171
Don't bother to announce anyone.
Just send them all up.

520
00:28:37,413 --> 00:28:39,281
It's all right. They're all his friends.

521
00:28:39,381 --> 00:28:41,039
<i>Here's the latest on the Julia Wolf murder.</i>

522
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:43,842
<i>Police found out the secretary</i>
<i>was once a gangster's girl.</i>

523
00:28:43,942 --> 00:28:45,279
<i>They're now looking for him.</i>

524
00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:47,438
<i>Wynant, her employer, is still missing.</i>

525
00:28:47,538 --> 00:28:50,162
Can't you fellows ever think
of anything but business?

526
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:51,642
Good case for you, Nick.

527
00:28:51,742 --> 00:28:54,159
Haven't you heard the news?
I'm a gentleman now.

528
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,527
Nick, reporters.

529
00:28:56,173 --> 00:28:58,556
- Salutations, boys.
- You're just the man I want to see.

530
00:28:58,656 --> 00:29:00,600
- I'm from the <i>American...</i>
- I'm from <i>The Mirror.</i>

531
00:29:00,701 --> 00:29:03,562
We want a statement. We hear you're here
on the Julia Wolf case.

532
00:29:03,662 --> 00:29:05,878
- I know nothing about it.
- Give us a break, will you?

533
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:09,720
Listen, I never try to kid reporters.
I'm telling you the truth.

534
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,760
Then why are you in town?

535
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,162
My wife's on a bender.
I'm trying to sober her up.

536
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:17,483
Waiter, drinks, please.

537
00:29:17,653 --> 00:29:19,883
Into the kitchen, son,
and thaw out some ice.

538
00:29:20,013 --> 00:29:22,121
Grandma, what large glasses you have.

539
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:24,240
- Is he working on a case?
- Yes.

540
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,530
- What case?
- A case of Scotch. Pitch in and help him.

541
00:29:30,053 --> 00:29:33,039
- I've got to order some food.
- Isn't it a waste of energy?

542
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:35,922
That sounds like an interesting case.
Why don't you take it?

543
00:29:36,022 --> 00:29:37,077
I haven't time.

544
00:29:37,177 --> 00:29:40,042
I'm too busy seeing you don't lose
the money I married you for.

545
00:29:40,142 --> 00:29:42,596
Room service, please.
Sounds like a good case.

546
00:29:42,696 --> 00:29:45,280
Girl mysteriously murdered.
Nobody knows who did it.

547
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,322
They haven't found any clues.
No gun, no fingerprints.

548
00:29:48,422 --> 00:29:52,485
I'll bet you dollars to dog biscuits
that they never thought of...

549
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:55,561
I don't want to hear anything about it.

550
00:29:56,493 --> 00:29:58,324
Is that my drink over there?

551
00:29:58,613 --> 00:30:00,524
- What are you drinking?
- Rye.

552
00:30:02,773 --> 00:30:04,285
Yes, that's yours.

553
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,244
Send me up a whole flock of sandwiches.

554
00:30:09,773 --> 00:30:13,238
I'd like to telephone my mother
and wish her a merry Christmas.

555
00:30:13,338 --> 00:30:16,399
- Why don't you?
- I haven't got any nickels.

556
00:30:16,499 --> 00:30:18,441
Forget the nickels, there you are.
Go ahead.

557
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:19,639
Thank you.

558
00:30:19,739 --> 00:30:20,768
Have a hunka?

559
00:30:20,893 --> 00:30:23,009
- I'll have two hunkas.
- Attaboy.

560
00:30:23,252 --> 00:30:27,769
Hello, give me long distance.
I want to talk to San Francisco.

561
00:30:34,372 --> 00:30:37,126
Nick, I've got to see you. Alone.

562
00:30:37,573 --> 00:30:39,122
Hello there, beautiful.

563
00:30:39,222 --> 00:30:42,199
- Come on, I'll take you.
- Look what's come to our party.

564
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,879
Let's cross the ice
and get away from the wolves.

565
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:47,400
- Who's the brunette?
- I used to bounce her on my knee.

566
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,403
Which knee? Can I touch it?

567
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:52,852
Well, baby, what's on your mind, if any?

568
00:30:52,973 --> 00:30:55,240
- You heard about Julia Wolf?
- Yeah.

569
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,520
There! Nick, you're hurting me.

570
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,286
Of course. That's what I intend to do.

571
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:04,409
- Are you trying to tell me you did it?
- Yes, I killed her.

572
00:31:05,013 --> 00:31:06,412
Sit down.

573
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,797
I hated her for coming between
my mother and father.

574
00:31:09,897 --> 00:31:11,681
She kept me from seeing my father.

575
00:31:11,781 --> 00:31:16,608
I went down to ask her where he was,
and she wouldn't tell me, so I shot her.

576
00:31:16,813 --> 00:31:19,088
- How many times?
- Once or twice.

577
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:22,478
- Where did you hit her?
- I hit her in the heart.

578
00:31:22,578 --> 00:31:25,202
- What did she do?
- She fell over.

579
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:27,284
- Did she scream?
- Yes.

580
00:31:27,573 --> 00:31:29,558
Which way did she fall?

581
00:31:29,658 --> 00:31:31,530
She fell over backwards.

582
00:31:32,453 --> 00:31:34,162
- Whom are you trying to protect?
- Oh, Nick...

583
00:31:34,262 --> 00:31:37,202
Now, wait a minute.
She was shot four times, fell on her face...

584
00:31:37,302 --> 00:31:41,002
she couldn't have screamed,
because she was killed instantly.

585
00:31:41,172 --> 00:31:43,733
- Who do you think did it?
- I don't know.

586
00:31:44,173 --> 00:31:46,121
- Where did you get this gun?
- In a pawnshop.

587
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:48,886
- Is that another lie?
- No, Nick, that's the truth.

588
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:50,173
Nick.

589
00:32:00,613 --> 00:32:01,837
I'm sorry.

590
00:32:01,937 --> 00:32:04,078
- Don't be silly. Take this drink.
- No, thank you.

591
00:32:04,178 --> 00:32:06,557
- Want to powder your nose?
- Make her take that.

592
00:32:06,657 --> 00:32:09,326
- Where did you get that?
- She brought it in.

593
00:32:09,613 --> 00:32:12,518
- Trying to make me believe she did it.
- What will you do with it?

594
00:32:12,618 --> 00:32:16,731
Nothing, until I find out if it's the gun
Julia Wolf was killed with.

595
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:19,358
Keep her in here.
Don't let the reporters get to her.

596
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:20,959
They may believe her.

597
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:22,682
Isn't that Dorothy Wynant?

598
00:32:22,782 --> 00:32:25,679
Yes. Wait a minute.
She doesn't know anything about it.

599
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:28,157
- And you said you weren't on the case.
- I'm not.

600
00:32:28,257 --> 00:32:30,760
- Hello, Ma!
- Here, give me that, will you?

601
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,962
- Wait, it's San Francisco. Hiya, Ma.
- Get off the wire, I want to talk business.

602
00:32:35,062 --> 00:32:37,436
Operator, give me Drydock 4-8000.

603
00:32:37,537 --> 00:32:41,679
Don't do that. Don't tell your paper
I'm working on anything, because I'm not.

604
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:43,401
He's just working on that little girl.

605
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:45,404
I want to talk to my mother.

606
00:32:46,253 --> 00:32:48,317
- Welcome to...
- Oh, Nick.

607
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:51,000
I want to talk to you
about something very important.

608
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,077
- I know, it's a convention. Come in.
- No.

609
00:32:53,178 --> 00:32:54,802
- Got your roller skates on?
- What?

610
00:32:54,902 --> 00:32:56,238
Let's get rolling.

611
00:32:56,339 --> 00:32:58,238
I'll take you right...

612
00:32:58,338 --> 00:33:01,131
No, here, let's... If you don't mind...

613
00:33:01,453 --> 00:33:02,886
Just step in here.

614
00:33:03,813 --> 00:33:04,957
Well...

615
00:33:05,057 --> 00:33:07,399
I'm sorry, Mimi,
it's the only place we can be alone.

616
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:09,290
Won't you sit down?

617
00:33:10,973 --> 00:33:13,038
Hello, Mr. Wynant.

618
00:33:13,138 --> 00:33:14,842
- Come in and have a drink.
- I don't drink.

619
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:17,999
Clyde Wynant is absolutely crazy
to stay away at a time like this.

620
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:20,680
No wonder the police think
he has something to do with it.

621
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,918
- What do you think?
- I know he hasn't.

622
00:33:23,018 --> 00:33:26,520
But I want awfully to see him.
I want to tell him something important.

623
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,720
And MacCaulay won't help a bit.
He thinks I just want money.

624
00:33:29,821 --> 00:33:31,041
Don't you?

625
00:33:31,172 --> 00:33:32,881
You're always teasing.

626
00:33:32,982 --> 00:33:35,965
- I beg your pardon.
- We're just chatting.

627
00:33:36,373 --> 00:33:39,082
Nick, you will help me find Clyde,
won't you?

628
00:33:39,182 --> 00:33:42,361
There are a thousand detectives
in New York. Why not hire one of them?

629
00:33:42,461 --> 00:33:45,119
But he knows you.
All you need do is get in touch with him.

630
00:33:45,219 --> 00:33:48,959
Tell him Mimi says everything is all right,
but that I've got to see him.

631
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:52,401
Again, I don't want any part of it.
Now, you take Dorothy home...

632
00:33:52,501 --> 00:33:56,122
- Dorothy. Is she here?
- Yes, she's in there with my wife.

633
00:33:57,372 --> 00:33:58,879
What did you tell them?

634
00:33:58,979 --> 00:34:00,442
- Wait a minute.
- Be quiet.

635
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:03,684
- Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
- She didn't tell us a thing.

636
00:34:04,413 --> 00:34:07,440
I was so excited.
I didn't realize what I was doing.

637
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:08,879
Come on, Dorothy, we'll go home.

638
00:34:08,979 --> 00:34:10,877
She doesn't have to go
if she doesn't want to.

639
00:34:10,977 --> 00:34:12,841
You can stay here, we'd love to have you.

640
00:34:12,941 --> 00:34:15,083
That's sweet of you. No, thanks, I'll go.

641
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:18,562
- Where's Gilbert?
- Gilbert? Is he here?

642
00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:20,679
We might as well be living in the lobby.

643
00:34:20,779 --> 00:34:22,881
There's a physiological
and psychological angle...

644
00:34:22,981 --> 00:34:25,842
in my father's relationship with Julia
that the police overlooked.

645
00:34:25,942 --> 00:34:29,882
I think it settles the whole question.
You see, my father was a sexagenarian.

646
00:34:29,982 --> 00:34:31,441
- He was?
- Yes, he admitted it.

647
00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:35,156
A sexagenarian?
But we can't put that in the paper.

648
00:34:35,256 --> 00:34:38,079
- Why not?
- You know how they are. Sex?

649
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:41,360
- Just say he was 60 years old.
- Is that what that means?

650
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,922
Of course.

651
00:34:43,022 --> 00:34:44,562
Hey, that's my hat!

652
00:34:44,662 --> 00:34:46,644
Come and get it, while it's hot.

653
00:34:47,373 --> 00:34:49,438
Come on, give us a break.

654
00:34:49,538 --> 00:34:53,003
- You owe me after that.
- I swear I don't know anything about it.

655
00:34:53,612 --> 00:34:55,204
Telephone, Nicky.

656
00:34:55,573 --> 00:34:57,564
I thought it was the door.

657
00:34:57,852 --> 00:34:59,003
Hello.

658
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:02,808
Mr. Charles?
I'd like to lay a proposition before you.

659
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:05,598
I can't discuss it over the telephone...

660
00:35:05,698 --> 00:35:08,332
but if you'll give me
a half-hour of your time...

661
00:35:09,813 --> 00:35:11,405
It's about Julia Wolf.

662
00:35:13,013 --> 00:35:14,164
Hello?

663
00:35:15,773 --> 00:35:17,047
What is it?

664
00:35:18,213 --> 00:35:20,204
Some guy trying to sell me insurance.

665
00:35:21,973 --> 00:35:23,718
- Where's Miss Wynant?
- She's gone.

666
00:35:23,818 --> 00:35:25,798
- Which way did she go?
- Out the back door.

667
00:35:25,898 --> 00:35:27,849
- You mean the little brunette?
- Yes.

668
00:35:29,613 --> 00:35:31,531
I'm sorry.

669
00:35:31,821 --> 00:35:33,804
Thanks, I'm engaged for this one.

670
00:35:44,253 --> 00:35:46,528
Face, no, don't do that.

671
00:35:49,693 --> 00:35:51,684
I want to talk to Ma.

672
00:35:53,573 --> 00:35:55,681
So you think you're a fighter?

673
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:56,888
So what?

674
00:35:57,293 --> 00:35:59,170
So listen, worm.

675
00:36:08,173 --> 00:36:11,079
Oh, Nicky, I love you.

676
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:13,970
Because you know such lovely people.

677
00:36:23,493 --> 00:36:24,493
What?

678
00:36:24,593 --> 00:36:26,478
- You asleep?
- Yes.

679
00:36:26,578 --> 00:36:28,643
Good, I want to talk to you.

680
00:36:29,613 --> 00:36:30,880
That's jolly.

681
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:35,082
Wouldn't you like to do a little detecting
once in a while just for fun?

682
00:36:35,182 --> 00:36:37,403
- Can't you get to sleep?
- No.

683
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:40,717
Maybe if you took a drink it would help.

684
00:36:40,817 --> 00:36:42,212
No, thanks.

685
00:36:42,613 --> 00:36:45,002
Maybe it would help if I took it.

686
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:48,085
Everybody says you're a grand detective.

687
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,965
They were kidding you.

688
00:36:50,093 --> 00:36:51,970
I'd like to see you work.

689
00:36:52,133 --> 00:36:55,284
Tomorrow morning, I'll get you
a whole lot of detective stories.

690
00:36:55,412 --> 00:36:57,768
I know, but that girl's in a tough spot.

691
00:36:57,973 --> 00:37:00,001
There's nothing I can do to help her.

692
00:37:00,101 --> 00:37:04,086
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you
to try and see if you could.

693
00:37:04,213 --> 00:37:06,602
Darling, my guess is...

694
00:37:08,933 --> 00:37:12,323
Wynant killed Julia
and Dorothy knows about it.

695
00:37:14,093 --> 00:37:17,085
The police will catch him
without any help from me.

696
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:21,367
I think I would like that drink.

697
00:37:26,853 --> 00:37:28,366
My darling...

698
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:32,601
I'll give you your Christmas present now,
if you'll give me mine.

699
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:35,207
- At breakfast.
- It's Christmas now.

700
00:37:38,493 --> 00:37:39,608
Breakfast.

701
00:37:43,412 --> 00:37:45,680
What're you gonna give me?
I hope I don't like it.

702
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,678
You'll have to keep them anyway.

703
00:37:47,778 --> 00:37:51,812
Because the man at the aquarium
said that he wouldn't take them back.

704
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:54,882
Did you hear a knock?

705
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:55,982
Yes.

706
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,372
It might be something important.

707
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,211
I'm sure it is.

708
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,079
- Is Mr. Charles here?
- Yes.

709
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:14,440
I gotta talk to him, that's all,
but I gotta do that.

710
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:18,685
All right, come in.
You wait here, I'll tell him you're here.

711
00:38:23,653 --> 00:38:26,725
- What in the name of...
- Someone to see you, dear.

712
00:38:26,853 --> 00:38:29,519
That's good.
I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.

713
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:33,599
Get up out of bed. Let me straighten
this up. You're worse than an infant.

714
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:37,759
Funny, those blankets must be
a little cockeyed.

715
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:39,366
Right, Asta?

716
00:38:46,293 --> 00:38:47,444
There.

717
00:38:48,053 --> 00:38:50,922
You've got the funniest look
on your face I ever saw in my life.

718
00:38:51,022 --> 00:38:53,732
Hurry up, go on out there.
That man's waiting for you.

719
00:38:54,773 --> 00:38:55,800
I gotta talk to you.

720
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,001
I want you to tell me something,
and give it to me straight. Get me?

721
00:38:59,101 --> 00:39:01,041
Would you mind putting that gun away?

722
00:39:01,141 --> 00:39:03,922
My wife doesn't care,
but I'm a very timid fellow.

723
00:39:04,022 --> 00:39:05,207
You idiot.

724
00:39:05,413 --> 00:39:06,846
Asta, come here.

725
00:39:07,453 --> 00:39:09,683
All right, shoot. I mean...

726
00:39:10,372 --> 00:39:11,559
what's on your mind?

727
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:15,038
You don't have to tell me you're tough.
I heard about you. I'm Joe Morelli.

728
00:39:15,138 --> 00:39:18,011
- I've never heard about you.
- I didn't knock Julia off.

729
00:39:18,173 --> 00:39:19,360
All right, you didn't.

730
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,837
I ain't seen her in three months.
We was all washed up.

731
00:39:21,937 --> 00:39:22,997
Why tell me?

732
00:39:23,097 --> 00:39:25,722
I had no reason to hurt her.
She was on the up and up with me.

733
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:29,118
But that dirty Nunheim got sore with her
because I clicked and he didn't.

734
00:39:29,218 --> 00:39:30,682
And he put the finger on me.

735
00:39:30,782 --> 00:39:34,078
This is all swell, but you're peddling
your fish in the wrong market.

736
00:39:34,178 --> 00:39:35,642
I've got nothing to do with this.

737
00:39:35,742 --> 00:39:38,559
Studsy Burke says you used to be okay,
that's why I'm here.

738
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:41,282
How is Studsy?
I didn't know he was out of stir.

739
00:39:41,382 --> 00:39:44,518
He's all right, he'd like to see you.
What's the law doing to me?

740
00:39:44,618 --> 00:39:47,562
Do they think I did it
or is it just something else to pin on me?

741
00:39:47,662 --> 00:39:48,998
If I knew I'd tell you.

742
00:39:49,098 --> 00:39:51,158
I don't know anything about it.
Ask the police.

743
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:53,600
That'd be about the smartest thing
I ever did.

744
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,237
I put the police captain in a hospital
for three weeks over an argument.

745
00:39:57,337 --> 00:39:59,361
They would like for me to come in
and ask questions.

746
00:39:59,461 --> 00:40:01,598
They'd like it down
to the end of their blackjacks.

747
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:03,358
I comes to you on the level.
Studsy says you're on the level.

748
00:40:03,459 --> 00:40:04,522
Why don't you be on the level?

749
00:40:05,293 --> 00:40:07,523
I am on the level.
If I knew anything I'd be...

750
00:40:07,653 --> 00:40:09,398
- What's that?
- I don't know.

751
00:40:09,499 --> 00:40:11,084
That makes this your party.

752
00:40:11,213 --> 00:40:13,886
- Open up! Police!
- Why, you two-timing...

753
00:40:24,813 --> 00:40:26,087
Okay, Bob.

754
00:40:26,413 --> 00:40:27,413
Nora.

755
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:31,519
- Give me that bottle.
- What knocked her out?

756
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:35,208
I did. She was in the line of fire.
Somebody call a doctor.

757
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:38,290
Here, baby. Sweet.

758
00:40:39,973 --> 00:40:42,081
- Help me up on the bed with her, will you?
- All right.

759
00:40:42,181 --> 00:40:43,722
Are you all right?

760
00:40:43,822 --> 00:40:46,159
You darn fool.
You didn't have to knock me out.

761
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,717
I knew you'd take him,
but I wanted to see you do it.

762
00:40:48,817 --> 00:40:50,798
There's a girl with hair on her chest.

763
00:40:50,898 --> 00:40:52,399
- Nicky.
- What?

764
00:40:52,499 --> 00:40:54,877
- Are you hurt?
- No, he just grazed me, that's all.

765
00:40:54,977 --> 00:40:57,718
- You are. Somebody get a doctor.
- There's one called already.

766
00:40:57,818 --> 00:41:00,885
- Get into bed. Are you all right?
- Sure, I can't even feel it.

767
00:41:01,013 --> 00:41:02,446
I'll get some towels.

768
00:41:04,813 --> 00:41:06,212
Pretty close.

769
00:41:06,653 --> 00:41:09,478
- Have a shot, will you?
- There you are. But you'll be okay.

770
00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:11,608
- Tough luck!
- Shut up!

771
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:14,802
- Here, darling, use this.
- Now, baby, it's only a scratch.

772
00:41:14,902 --> 00:41:17,276
- Do you want a drink?
- What do you think?

773
00:41:17,377 --> 00:41:19,358
How did you people
happen to pop in here?

774
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:22,959
We hear this is getting to be
a meeting place for the Wynant family.

775
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:26,837
We figured we'd stick around just in case
the old boy himself should show up.

776
00:41:26,937 --> 00:41:29,678
Then we see this bird sneak in,
and we decide to come up.

777
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,199
And lucky for you we did.

778
00:41:31,299 --> 00:41:34,480
- Yeah, I might not have been shot.
- You know this monkey?

779
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,718
- That dirty little rat Nunheim...
- Shut up!

780
00:41:36,818 --> 00:41:39,160
- Is he a friend of yours?
- I never saw him before.

781
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,519
What did he want with you?

782
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:43,163
He wanted to tell me
that he didn't kill Julia Wolf.

783
00:41:43,263 --> 00:41:45,158
- What's that to you?
- Nothing.

784
00:41:45,258 --> 00:41:46,962
What did he think it was to you?

785
00:41:47,062 --> 00:41:48,197
Ask him.

786
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,959
I'm asking you.

787
00:41:50,059 --> 00:41:51,486
Keep on asking.

788
00:41:51,973 --> 00:41:54,560
- Frisk the dump.
- Not without a warrant.

789
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,042
So you say! Go on, Bob.

790
00:41:57,733 --> 00:41:58,883
Tough?

791
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,760
Now look here, Charles, the both of us
are going about this in the wrong way.

792
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,040
I don't want to get tough with you.
I'm sure you don't want to either.

793
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,958
Just one more question I want to ask you.

794
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,958
Are you willing to swear to a complaint
for this guy's plugging you?

795
00:42:11,058 --> 00:42:14,728
That's another one I can't answer now.
Maybe it was an accident.

796
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:20,329
What's that man doing in my drawers?

797
00:42:23,372 --> 00:42:25,045
Here you are, Lieutenant.

798
00:42:27,693 --> 00:42:29,279
You got a pistol permit?

799
00:42:29,379 --> 00:42:30,379
No.

800
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,929
- Ever heard of the Sullivan Act?
- That's all right. We're married.

801
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,448
- This gun yours?
- No.

802
00:42:37,053 --> 00:42:40,170
- Whose is it?
- I'll have to try to remember.

803
00:42:41,093 --> 00:42:43,288
Okay, we got plenty of time.

804
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:46,925
I guess I'll have to ask you a lot more
questions than I figured.

805
00:42:47,213 --> 00:42:49,886
We'll come around tomorrow
when you're feeling better.

806
00:42:50,213 --> 00:42:52,169
All right, come on, boys.

807
00:42:54,693 --> 00:42:56,684
Where's Asta? Asta.

808
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:03,365
Come here.

809
00:43:04,813 --> 00:43:06,681
You're a fine watchdog.

810
00:43:06,781 --> 00:43:08,279
He's got more sense than you have.

811
00:43:08,379 --> 00:43:10,329
I'm glad you're not on this case.

812
00:43:10,692 --> 00:43:13,040
On it? I'm in it, they think I did it.

813
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,044
Well, didn't you?

814
00:44:18,302 --> 00:44:19,894
I hope you're satisfied.

815
00:44:21,661 --> 00:44:23,567
Where am I?

816
00:44:23,667 --> 00:44:25,653
You're not in a shooting gallery!

817
00:44:25,781 --> 00:44:29,449
But, sugar, this is the nicest
Christmas present I've ever had.

818
00:44:29,549 --> 00:44:33,491
You act as though it were the only
Christmas present you ever had.

819
00:44:33,591 --> 00:44:35,971
Where did you get that wristwatch?

820
00:44:37,062 --> 00:44:38,126
It's a Christmas present.

821
00:44:38,226 --> 00:44:40,497
- Yeah? Who gave it to you?
- You did.

822
00:44:43,342 --> 00:44:46,220
You must admit I've got pretty good taste,
haven't I?

823
00:44:46,462 --> 00:44:47,888
Have you finished with this?

824
00:44:47,988 --> 00:44:50,728
Yes, and I know as much
about the murder as they do.

825
00:44:50,828 --> 00:44:54,089
I'm a hero.
I was shot twice in the <i>Tribune.</i>

826
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:56,970
I read where you were shot
five times in the tabloids.

827
00:44:57,071 --> 00:45:00,293
It's not true. He didn't come
anywhere near my tabloids.

828
00:45:02,622 --> 00:45:03,766
Bull's eye!

829
00:45:03,866 --> 00:45:06,660
Hello. Who is it? Send him right up.

830
00:45:08,182 --> 00:45:09,456
Who was that?

831
00:45:09,622 --> 00:45:11,055
Mr. MacCaulay.

832
00:45:11,222 --> 00:45:14,259
The Mallorys.
Oh, dear, I forgot all about them.

833
00:45:14,382 --> 00:45:15,691
Aren't you hot in that?

834
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:18,501
Yes, I'm stifling. But it's so pretty.

835
00:45:18,662 --> 00:45:19,929
The Kirbys.

836
00:45:20,029 --> 00:45:22,331
Is that another Christmas present?

837
00:45:23,502 --> 00:45:25,253
- Did I give it to you?
- Yes.

838
00:45:26,022 --> 00:45:27,171
I'm spoiling you.

839
00:45:28,222 --> 00:45:30,690
Why, Nicky, this is from Clyde Wynant.

840
00:45:31,142 --> 00:45:34,729
He says, " Will you take charge
of investigation on Julia Wolf murder?

841
00:45:34,829 --> 00:45:37,328
- "Communicate with Herbert MacCaulay."
- Let me see.

842
00:45:37,428 --> 00:45:40,858
- Where's it from?
- Philadelphia. Well, then, he didn't do it.

843
00:45:41,022 --> 00:45:42,289
I don't know.

844
00:45:42,389 --> 00:45:45,658
He wouldn't ask you to handle it
if he were guilty, would he?

845
00:45:47,102 --> 00:45:49,007
Your guess is as good as mine, baby.

846
00:45:49,107 --> 00:45:50,651
Nicky, take the case.

847
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:52,413
You take it. I'm too busy.

848
00:45:53,862 --> 00:45:55,410
- How do you do?
- Good morning.

849
00:45:55,511 --> 00:45:58,248
I'm afraid this isn't a very
merry Christmas for you.

850
00:45:58,348 --> 00:45:59,970
- He's all right.
- Good.

851
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:02,287
- How are you, MacCaulay?
- I'm fine.

852
00:46:02,387 --> 00:46:04,447
- Sit down.
- You're coming along better than I am.

853
00:46:04,547 --> 00:46:08,369
- I hope you're not seriously hurt.
- No, just a scratch. I've forgotten it.

854
00:46:08,469 --> 00:46:12,011
- What a delightful toy.
- That's Asta's Christmas present.

855
00:46:12,621 --> 00:46:14,570
I got word from Wynant this morning.

856
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,892
So did we, I mean, Sherlock here.

857
00:46:17,421 --> 00:46:20,652
- Darling, will you...
- Pass you your drink? Yes.

858
00:46:22,942 --> 00:46:24,295
Thank you.

859
00:46:25,462 --> 00:46:28,090
What are the chances
of getting you to do what he wants?

860
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,491
- Slim.
- Oh, Nick.

861
00:46:29,591 --> 00:46:32,408
Well, would it help
if I could persuade him to meet you?

862
00:46:32,508 --> 00:46:33,645
It might.

863
00:46:33,746 --> 00:46:36,009
He gave me a code message
to insert in the <i>Times...</i>

864
00:46:36,109 --> 00:46:37,890
in case I wanted to get in touch with him.

865
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:41,489
- I don't suppose it would hurt to put it in.
- I've done that already.

866
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:43,291
He should appear, you know.

867
00:46:43,391 --> 00:46:46,288
It doesn't look well,
his staying away at a time like this.

868
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:48,373
- Police.
- For me?

869
00:46:49,622 --> 00:46:50,773
Hello.

870
00:46:51,662 --> 00:46:52,813
Where?

871
00:46:53,342 --> 00:46:54,741
Allentown?

872
00:46:55,382 --> 00:46:56,382
Yes.

873
00:46:56,862 --> 00:46:58,534
When is the next train?

874
00:46:59,022 --> 00:47:00,978
Right. I'll get that.

875
00:47:01,702 --> 00:47:03,330
Wynant's tried to commit suicide.

876
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:05,572
They want me to go down
and identify him.

877
00:47:06,822 --> 00:47:09,531
I guess this changes the whole story,
doesn't it?

878
00:47:09,631 --> 00:47:12,810
That looks like an admission of guilt.
And I had such hopes.

879
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,691
I thought if you got on the case
you'd be able to clear him.

880
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:19,457
I thought that Mimi, the way she acted,
I was sure that...

881
00:47:19,982 --> 00:47:21,408
Oh, well.

882
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:24,141
There's no use thinking about that now.

883
00:47:24,302 --> 00:47:27,054
I'm sorry to have wasted
so much of your time.

884
00:47:27,381 --> 00:47:29,249
Goodbye. Have a merry Christmas.

885
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:30,730
Thank you. Same to you.

886
00:47:30,831 --> 00:47:32,255
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

887
00:47:40,702 --> 00:47:44,251
Asta, is your balloon busted? So is mine.

888
00:47:44,982 --> 00:47:48,207
- What's the matter with you?
- The mystery's all gone.

889
00:47:48,307 --> 00:47:51,374
- I was hoping you'd find out who did it.
- Maybe I will.

890
00:47:52,022 --> 00:47:54,490
- If Wynant...
- I don't believe he did it.

891
00:47:54,902 --> 00:47:57,010
- Why don't you?
- No reason, just a hunch.

892
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:00,051
But I'm going to find out.
I'm tired of being pushed around.

893
00:48:00,151 --> 00:48:02,656
Come on, Dr. Watson, let's go places.

894
00:48:09,742 --> 00:48:11,850
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

895
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:13,216
Excuse me.

896
00:48:14,502 --> 00:48:17,451
Not a nice trick you're trying to pull,
running out like this...

897
00:48:17,551 --> 00:48:20,448
when I was giving you time to rest
before I questioned you.

898
00:48:20,548 --> 00:48:21,809
What? About the gun?

899
00:48:21,909 --> 00:48:24,611
That never was a gun.
Don't waste time talking about that.

900
00:48:24,711 --> 00:48:27,086
Look here, man to man,
are you working on this case?

901
00:48:27,186 --> 00:48:29,289
- Man to man, I'm not.
- But he's interested.

902
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:31,846
I'd rather have you working with us
than against us.

903
00:48:31,946 --> 00:48:34,528
- That suits me.
- Then it's a bargain.

904
00:48:34,628 --> 00:48:36,048
Anything you want to know?

905
00:48:36,148 --> 00:48:37,967
- What about the suicide?
- That was a phony.

906
00:48:38,067 --> 00:48:40,568
- The boys didn't even have to go down.
- I thought it might be.

907
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:43,531
Now they'll think every thin man
with white hair is Wynant.

908
00:48:43,631 --> 00:48:45,888
- Do you think Wynant did it?
- I don't know.

909
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:48,808
He planned something.
He closed up his apartment and shop.

910
00:48:48,908 --> 00:48:51,807
- Were you there?
- Yes, but I couldn't find a thing.

911
00:48:51,907 --> 00:48:53,408
I figure it like this.

912
00:48:53,508 --> 00:48:56,167
Wynant went to Julia's apartment
and found Morelli there.

913
00:48:56,268 --> 00:49:00,609
Sees she's two-timing him, there's a fight.
He doesn't do anything because of Morelli.

914
00:49:00,709 --> 00:49:04,970
Lets his lawyer give her money to give
to him so she'll think it's blown over.

915
00:49:05,071 --> 00:49:07,780
Then when she isn't expecting it,
he lets her have it.

916
00:49:08,142 --> 00:49:10,692
- No proof?
- Nothing as yet to cinch it.

917
00:49:10,792 --> 00:49:13,688
- $50 will get you $100 that he didn't do it.
- What do you mean?

918
00:49:13,788 --> 00:49:16,049
For one thing, he was too absent-minded
to hold a grudge.

919
00:49:16,149 --> 00:49:18,409
- Who's your candidate?
- I haven't gotten that far yet.

920
00:49:18,509 --> 00:49:20,886
Not everything points to Wynant.
How about your alibis?

921
00:49:20,986 --> 00:49:22,328
They're all okay.

922
00:49:22,428 --> 00:49:25,008
Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy,
MacCaulay, even Morelli.

923
00:49:25,108 --> 00:49:26,411
We had to let him go.

924
00:49:26,511 --> 00:49:29,088
- What about Jorgensen?
- I'll check on that.

925
00:49:29,189 --> 00:49:33,850
- Mrs. Charles, this must be dull for you.
- Dull? I'm sitting on the edge of my chair.

926
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:35,809
- What about Nunheim?
- He's all right.

927
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:38,851
We know all about him.
He does some stooling for us occasionally.

928
00:49:38,951 --> 00:49:41,087
Did you know he's been
hanging around Julia?

929
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:42,187
No.

930
00:49:42,621 --> 00:49:46,058
- He's holding out on you.
- Let's look into that.

931
00:49:46,422 --> 00:49:47,422
Taxi!

932
00:49:48,062 --> 00:49:51,489
This may get a bit rough, baby.
I think you better let us go alone.

933
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:53,891
Catch me letting you go alone!

934
00:49:58,661 --> 00:50:00,095
Grant's Tomb.

935
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,502
Taxi!

936
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,940
- Who is it?
- John.

937
00:50:23,462 --> 00:50:24,860
Hello, Lieutenant.

938
00:50:26,422 --> 00:50:27,821
Sit down, Nick.

939
00:50:29,422 --> 00:50:33,017
I wasn't expecting you, Lieutenant.
You said you'd phone.

940
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:38,931
Have a shot?

941
00:50:39,031 --> 00:50:42,290
What's the idea of telling me
you knew the Wolf girl just by sight?

942
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:45,020
That's all I did, Lieutenant.
That's the God's truth.

943
00:50:45,581 --> 00:50:48,301
Maybe I said hello to her.

944
00:50:48,542 --> 00:50:50,527
"How are you,"
or something when I saw her...

945
00:50:50,627 --> 00:50:53,659
but that's all I did, Lieutenant.
That's the truth!

946
00:50:54,582 --> 00:50:57,089
You open your mouth
and I'll pop a tooth out of it.

947
00:50:57,189 --> 00:50:58,615
- Is that so!
- Yeah!

948
00:51:02,422 --> 00:51:03,646
Cut it out!

949
00:51:03,746 --> 00:51:06,779
We didn't come here
to watch you two roughhouse.

950
00:51:08,302 --> 00:51:11,410
She's driving me nuts.
She's been ragging me all day.

951
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:13,929
Maybe if you'd quit running around
after other women...

952
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,809
you wouldn't have trouble with this one.

953
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:18,974
That's a lie.
Anybody that says that is a liar!

954
00:51:20,421 --> 00:51:22,652
Do you want to take a poke at him?

955
00:51:24,702 --> 00:51:26,889
I didn't mean you, mister.

956
00:51:26,989 --> 00:51:28,973
Come on, she can't hear you now.

957
00:51:31,262 --> 00:51:33,849
You know how it is.
A guy knocking around...

958
00:51:33,949 --> 00:51:36,979
You'd have done better
to have told me that in the beginning.

959
00:51:37,822 --> 00:51:40,329
Where were you the afternoon
she was knocked off?

960
00:51:40,429 --> 00:51:42,247
You don't think
I had anything to do with it!

961
00:51:42,347 --> 00:51:43,491
Where were you?

962
00:51:46,142 --> 00:51:47,967
- Marion!
- Wait a minute!

963
00:51:48,067 --> 00:51:49,648
I don't like crooks.

964
00:51:49,748 --> 00:51:52,808
And if I did, I wouldn't like stool pigeons.

965
00:51:52,908 --> 00:51:56,861
And if I did like stool pigeons,
I still wouldn't like you.

966
00:51:57,422 --> 00:51:59,247
Marion, don't go!

967
00:51:59,347 --> 00:52:02,848
Wait a minute! I'll do anything you say!
I'll behave! Don't go!

968
00:52:02,949 --> 00:52:04,251
Let me get after her.

969
00:52:04,351 --> 00:52:07,008
Let me bring her back, please.
I'll bring her right back.

970
00:52:07,108 --> 00:52:09,369
I'll do anything!
I'll answer anything you want!

971
00:52:09,469 --> 00:52:10,568
Sit down!

972
00:52:10,668 --> 00:52:13,568
We didn't come here to watch
you two dance around the Maypole.

973
00:52:13,668 --> 00:52:15,567
Where were you when the girl was killed?

974
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:19,257
I don't know. I can't remember!
I can't tell you just offhand.

975
00:52:20,022 --> 00:52:22,049
Maybe I was down
at Charley's shooting pool.

976
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:24,177
Maybe I was up here, I don't know.

977
00:52:24,302 --> 00:52:25,409
She'd remember!

978
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:28,568
How'd you like to be thrown in the can
on account of not remembering?

979
00:52:28,668 --> 00:52:30,857
Just give me a minute. I'll remember.

980
00:52:31,302 --> 00:52:34,817
You know I ain't stalling.
I always come clean with you.

981
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:40,452
Sure, I remember.

982
00:52:41,022 --> 00:52:43,582
I wouldn't blame you
if you threw me in the can.

983
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:46,887
I remember where I was.
That's the afternoon...

984
00:52:46,987 --> 00:52:48,938
Wait a minute, I'll show you.

985
00:52:55,702 --> 00:52:57,533
What do you think of it?

986
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:00,137
I think we're on the right track.

987
00:53:01,902 --> 00:53:03,494
Who are you phoning?

988
00:53:03,742 --> 00:53:06,930
I'm phoning your office
so they can send out a man to trail him.

989
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:10,087
- I want to see where he goes.
- Trail him? Trail who?

990
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,331
Nunheim.

991
00:53:16,102 --> 00:53:17,740
Give me that phone.

992
00:53:18,182 --> 00:53:21,725
Bill, pick up Nunheim, tell the boys.
He just left, went down the fire escape.

993
00:53:21,825 --> 00:53:23,610
Cover the Grand Central
and Pennsylvania Stations.

994
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,846
Check all airports
and steamship terminals.

995
00:53:25,946 --> 00:53:29,456
What's that?
No, have Lefty radio all the cars.

996
00:53:29,822 --> 00:53:32,408
He was dressed
in a black pair of pants, yes.

997
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,647
How should I know if
his underwear's embroidered?

998
00:53:34,747 --> 00:53:35,747
What?

999
00:53:35,906 --> 00:53:37,017
Listen.

1000
00:53:37,462 --> 00:53:41,048
They've been questioning me again today,
asking me what more I know...

1001
00:53:41,149 --> 00:53:42,531
where I was that day.

1002
00:53:42,631 --> 00:53:44,888
Now, wait a minute, I ducked out on them.

1003
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:47,968
Now, look, if you want me to play dumb
anymore, I want $5,000 more.

1004
00:53:48,068 --> 00:53:50,292
$5,000 and I'll blow town today.

1005
00:53:52,622 --> 00:53:54,532
Okay. Where?

1006
00:53:55,622 --> 00:53:57,374
All right, right away.

1007
00:53:57,542 --> 00:53:59,578
See that you're there,
and bring it with you.

1008
00:54:13,342 --> 00:54:15,536
Arthur Nunheim, honorary member.

1009
00:54:15,862 --> 00:54:17,454
No, not a thing.

1010
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:19,609
Find out about that bullet yet?

1011
00:54:19,709 --> 00:54:22,129
Yes, sir, it's the same gun
that killed Julia Wolf.

1012
00:54:22,229 --> 00:54:24,019
And how are your folks?

1013
00:54:26,582 --> 00:54:27,697
Hello?

1014
00:54:29,742 --> 00:54:31,060
How are you?

1015
00:54:31,341 --> 00:54:34,140
No, we didn't find a thing. It's your wife.

1016
00:54:35,741 --> 00:54:37,972
And, Lieutenant, I've got something.

1017
00:54:38,222 --> 00:54:40,330
I've been doing
a little detecting on my own.

1018
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:44,097
That flatfoot I married thinks he's smart,
but I'm just one jump ahead of him.

1019
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:47,338
That's swell, Mrs. Charles.

1020
00:54:49,742 --> 00:54:51,892
How did you like Grant's Tomb?

1021
00:54:54,062 --> 00:54:56,860
It's lovely.
I'm having a copy made for you.

1022
00:55:00,102 --> 00:55:01,979
What have you got, baby?

1023
00:55:03,022 --> 00:55:04,819
I can't quite hear you.

1024
00:55:07,062 --> 00:55:08,654
We'll be right up.

1025
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:11,728
She's up at Mimi's.
Jorgensen's disappeared.

1026
00:55:11,829 --> 00:55:12,829
Well!

1027
00:55:14,622 --> 00:55:16,208
Chris may be at the club or somewhere.

1028
00:55:16,308 --> 00:55:18,011
I can't see that that's important.

1029
00:55:18,111 --> 00:55:19,970
You should have told them
he disappeared.

1030
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:22,366
But he has nothing to do with it.

1031
00:55:22,466 --> 00:55:25,368
That's not for you to decide.
Everybody's under suspicion.

1032
00:55:25,468 --> 00:55:27,490
Especially running off like this.

1033
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,088
The police will want a description.

1034
00:55:29,188 --> 00:55:31,449
- Is this his picture?
- I tell you, he didn't do it.

1035
00:55:31,549 --> 00:55:33,650
They'll want more than your word for that.

1036
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,408
All right, I'll tell them who did do it.

1037
00:55:35,508 --> 00:55:36,508
Mother!

1038
00:55:36,608 --> 00:55:38,492
And I'll give them proof.

1039
00:55:49,782 --> 00:55:52,137
- Dorry.
- Oh, Tommy!

1040
00:55:52,422 --> 00:55:53,928
Please, don't cry.

1041
00:55:54,028 --> 00:55:56,167
I can't help it. You don't know.

1042
00:55:56,267 --> 00:55:58,327
You can't go through any more of this.

1043
00:55:58,427 --> 00:55:59,928
Get together your clothes and skates.

1044
00:56:00,028 --> 00:56:01,528
We'll go to my family in the country.

1045
00:56:01,628 --> 00:56:02,765
No, I can't.

1046
00:56:02,865 --> 00:56:04,809
But you've got to get your mind
off all this.

1047
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:07,018
Darling, you've been so sweet.

1048
00:56:07,422 --> 00:56:10,131
There's only one thing you can do for me
and that is to go.

1049
00:56:10,231 --> 00:56:12,409
- Go?
- Go and never see me again.

1050
00:56:12,509 --> 00:56:16,487
- What are you talking about?
- Please, you can't get mixed up in this.

1051
00:56:16,587 --> 00:56:18,088
Do you think I care about that?

1052
00:56:18,188 --> 00:56:20,891
You don't understand.
You don't know what's going to happen.

1053
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,446
All I know is that I want you
to marry me right now.

1054
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,687
I can't marry you. I can't ever marry you.

1055
00:56:25,787 --> 00:56:27,100
Dorothy!

1056
00:56:27,502 --> 00:56:30,052
How'd you like to have
a couple of murderers for children?

1057
00:56:30,152 --> 00:56:31,249
That'd be fun, wouldn't it?

1058
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:34,051
Perhaps they'll murder each other
and keep it in the family.

1059
00:56:34,151 --> 00:56:36,329
Father should have killed Gilbert and me.

1060
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:38,327
Then we wouldn't have had all this
to go through.

1061
00:56:38,427 --> 00:56:40,168
You're talking like a crazy person.

1062
00:56:40,268 --> 00:56:42,811
Why not? I am crazy, all our family is.

1063
00:56:42,912 --> 00:56:45,408
Dorothy, listen to me.
I love you, do you understand that?

1064
00:56:45,509 --> 00:56:46,571
I love you.

1065
00:56:48,582 --> 00:56:49,856
Please go.

1066
00:56:58,622 --> 00:57:01,341
Sleuthing isn't much fun after all, is it?

1067
00:57:01,982 --> 00:57:04,371
I feel awfully sorry for that girl.

1068
00:57:05,302 --> 00:57:06,735
Find anything?

1069
00:57:07,182 --> 00:57:08,900
She's ready to talk.

1070
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:12,251
It wouldn't do any harm, though,
to find out where he is.

1071
00:57:12,351 --> 00:57:15,530
You know, you're wrong
about all of your children being murderers.

1072
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:17,409
I studied the Mendelian Law
of Inheritance...

1073
00:57:17,509 --> 00:57:19,211
and their experiments with sweet peas.

1074
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:22,047
According to their findings,
and they're pretty conclusive...

1075
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,851
only one out of four of your children
will be a murderer.

1076
00:57:24,951 --> 00:57:27,969
Now, the thing for you to do
would be to just have three children.

1077
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:31,896
No, that might not work.
The first one might be the bad one.

1078
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:33,326
I'll have to look that up.

1079
00:57:33,426 --> 00:57:34,891
You needn't bother looking that up.

1080
00:57:34,991 --> 00:57:37,808
I'm not going to get married,
and I'm not having any children.

1081
00:57:37,908 --> 00:57:40,127
From now on, I'm just out for the ride.

1082
00:57:40,227 --> 00:57:44,659
I took it from her hand.
It was Mr. Wynant's watch chain.

1083
00:57:45,782 --> 00:57:47,659
I wanted to protect him.

1084
00:57:49,582 --> 00:57:51,886
Well, I guess that cinches it, eh, Charles?

1085
00:57:51,986 --> 00:57:55,133
He killed them both,
the Wolf girl and Nunheim.

1086
00:57:55,462 --> 00:57:56,931
$50 will still get you $100.

1087
00:57:57,031 --> 00:57:58,341
That's enough for me.

1088
00:57:58,982 --> 00:58:00,126
<i>Extra!</i>

1089
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:03,100
<i>Wynant's ex-wife produces</i>
<i>murder evidence!</i>

1090
00:58:26,182 --> 00:58:29,210
I wish they'd stop that.
It gives me the fidgets.

1091
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:32,533
I wonder if they'll find him?
He must be in New York.

1092
00:58:32,862 --> 00:58:34,368
Where do you think you're going?

1093
00:58:34,468 --> 00:58:37,128
- I'm taking Asta for a walk.
- He's just been for a walk.

1094
00:58:37,228 --> 00:58:38,691
We're going sightseeing, aren't we?

1095
00:58:38,791 --> 00:58:40,049
What's that?

1096
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:42,489
That's known in burgling circles
as a flashlight.

1097
00:58:42,589 --> 00:58:44,492
Nick, what are you up to?

1098
00:58:45,222 --> 00:58:46,329
What is this?

1099
00:58:46,429 --> 00:58:49,488
- Looks like a hold up.
- What are you going to do?

1100
00:58:49,588 --> 00:58:52,451
I'm going down to Wynant's shop
to find out why it's closed.

1101
00:58:52,551 --> 00:58:54,208
Why wouldn't he close it? He went away.

1102
00:58:54,308 --> 00:58:56,729
He went away when I knew him,
but never closed his shop.

1103
00:58:56,829 --> 00:58:57,885
I got a hunch.

1104
00:58:57,986 --> 00:58:59,046
You think he's hiding there?

1105
00:58:59,146 --> 00:59:01,046
I don't know, but this is giving me the itch.

1106
00:59:01,147 --> 00:59:04,249
- I'm going to find out.
- Nick, I won't have you going down there.

1107
00:59:04,349 --> 00:59:06,726
It was you that got me into this.

1108
00:59:06,826 --> 00:59:10,446
I know, but this is different.
He's a crazy man. He might kill you.

1109
00:59:10,546 --> 00:59:13,420
He won't kill me.
I've got Asta to protect me.

1110
00:59:13,621 --> 00:59:16,368
All right, go ahead. Go on, see if I care.

1111
00:59:16,468 --> 00:59:19,847
It's a dirty trick, bringing me to New York,
just to make a widow of me.

1112
00:59:19,947 --> 00:59:22,246
- You wouldn't be a widow long.
- You bet I wouldn't.

1113
00:59:22,346 --> 00:59:24,537
- Not with all your money.
- Fool.

1114
00:59:25,462 --> 00:59:27,373
Well, any port in a storm.

1115
00:59:27,742 --> 00:59:29,539
Goodbye, sugar.

1116
00:59:38,822 --> 00:59:40,255
Take care of yourself.

1117
00:59:40,622 --> 00:59:41,686
Sure I will.

1118
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:44,768
Don't say it like that.
Say it as if you meant it.

1119
00:59:44,868 --> 00:59:48,252
- I do believe the little woman cares.
- I don't care.

1120
00:59:48,702 --> 00:59:51,455
It's just that I'm used to you, that's all.

1121
01:00:01,382 --> 01:00:05,534
If you let anything happen to him,
you'll never wag that tail again.

1122
01:00:15,062 --> 01:00:16,850
You sure this is
the place you wanted to come to?

1123
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:17,950
Yes.

1124
01:00:18,662 --> 01:00:20,327
You don't want me to wait, do you?

1125
01:00:20,428 --> 01:00:22,290
Certainly. You're not afraid, are you?

1126
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:23,895
No, I guess not.

1127
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:26,294
All right, Asta.

1128
01:01:43,782 --> 01:01:45,340
Come on, Asta.

1129
01:02:03,182 --> 01:02:06,140
Asta, you're not a terrier,
you're a police dog.

1130
01:02:46,781 --> 01:02:48,500
No, Asta. No.

1131
01:02:58,301 --> 01:03:00,941
Asta, get away from there. Come on.

1132
01:03:06,462 --> 01:03:07,781
Come on.

1133
01:04:10,982 --> 01:04:12,967
Hello, Lt. Guild, please.

1134
01:04:13,067 --> 01:04:14,381
Hello, John?

1135
01:04:14,742 --> 01:04:17,620
This is Nick Charles.
I'm up in Wynant's shop.

1136
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:20,812
Well, I've found something.

1137
01:04:21,662 --> 01:04:22,981
It's a body.

1138
01:04:56,102 --> 01:04:57,535
Stick them up.

1139
01:05:04,182 --> 01:05:05,534
Turn around.

1140
01:05:10,462 --> 01:05:13,977
Now, don't make a move,
or that dog will tear you to shreds.

1141
01:05:20,062 --> 01:05:22,771
All right, you can come out now.
He won't hurt you.

1142
01:05:22,871 --> 01:05:24,086
Up to your old tricks, Tanner?

1143
01:05:24,186 --> 01:05:25,528
You're Mr. Charles, aren't you?

1144
01:05:25,628 --> 01:05:27,729
- Yes, how did you get in here?
- I have a key.

1145
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:29,850
I use to work here
till they closed up the shop.

1146
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:31,006
You worked here?

1147
01:05:31,106 --> 01:05:33,608
Yes, Julia Wolf got me a job here
as bookkeeper.

1148
01:05:33,709 --> 01:05:35,969
Well, that's a hot one. Bookkeeper.

1149
01:05:36,069 --> 01:05:37,408
Where did you learn bookkeeping?

1150
01:05:37,508 --> 01:05:40,929
That last time you sent me up
I learned bookkeeping in Sing Sing.

1151
01:05:41,029 --> 01:05:43,050
I figured it would be
an in for me somewheres.

1152
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:44,967
Somewheres they might
leave the safe open?

1153
01:05:45,067 --> 01:05:47,090
Honest, I never touched that safe.

1154
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:49,528
Them bonds that was missing,
Julia Wolf took them.

1155
01:05:49,629 --> 01:05:51,090
Trying to put it off on her?

1156
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:52,928
Mr. Charles, she did.

1157
01:05:53,028 --> 01:05:55,209
That's why he got sore at her
and killed her.

1158
01:05:55,309 --> 01:05:57,765
Listen, Mr. Charles,
can I take my hands down?

1159
01:05:57,865 --> 01:05:58,865
Okay.

1160
01:06:02,422 --> 01:06:04,407
I did do a bit of chiseling.

1161
01:06:04,507 --> 01:06:06,929
I come to bring the money back
and fix up the books.

1162
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:08,029
Easy.

1163
01:06:08,309 --> 01:06:11,453
It's all right, Mr. Charles,
it's just a pocketbook.

1164
01:06:12,782 --> 01:06:14,926
I didn't want him to find out
and come after me.

1165
01:06:15,026 --> 01:06:16,571
You can save that. Tell it to the police.

1166
01:06:16,671 --> 01:06:17,671
Police?

1167
01:06:31,342 --> 01:06:34,652
- Move over, will you?
- Haven't you got that yet?

1168
01:06:36,422 --> 01:06:38,130
You wouldn't know anything about this?

1169
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:39,488
No, sir.

1170
01:06:39,588 --> 01:06:42,415
Take him down to Central.
I'll talk to him later.

1171
01:06:47,582 --> 01:06:49,807
Wonder what Wynant had
against this one.

1172
01:06:49,907 --> 01:06:51,176
Quicklime.

1173
01:06:51,982 --> 01:06:53,249
Mind if I look these over?

1174
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:56,248
No, go ahead.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.

1175
01:06:56,348 --> 01:06:58,892
Lucky thing for us
these weren't entirely eaten up.

1176
01:06:58,992 --> 01:07:00,691
Extraordinarily lucky.

1177
01:07:00,791 --> 01:07:02,374
No identification.

1178
01:07:03,141 --> 01:07:06,372
He must have weighed 250 pounds,
if he weighed an ounce.

1179
01:07:06,742 --> 01:07:08,300
Here's something.

1180
01:07:10,222 --> 01:07:12,525
Rubber-tipped. Must have been lame.

1181
01:07:12,625 --> 01:07:15,659
Who wouldn't be,
carrying all that weight around?

1182
01:07:17,702 --> 01:07:20,251
I should say he stood about 5'11",
wouldn't you, Doc?

1183
01:07:20,351 --> 01:07:21,502
About.

1184
01:07:26,302 --> 01:07:27,576
"D.W.R."

1185
01:07:28,182 --> 01:07:29,182
"R."

1186
01:07:30,021 --> 01:07:34,088
Say, that case you worked on,
that man who threatened to kill Wynant...

1187
01:07:34,188 --> 01:07:35,820
What was has name?

1188
01:07:36,342 --> 01:07:37,821
Rosebreen.

1189
01:07:38,622 --> 01:07:40,658
Say, could this be the man?

1190
01:07:41,062 --> 01:07:43,728
I never saw him.
I don't think anybody ever saw him.

1191
01:07:43,828 --> 01:07:47,089
He threatened to kill Wynant
for an invention he stole, wasn't that it?

1192
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:49,130
Yes, but we figured that was blackmail.

1193
01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:52,367
Just the same, he wouldn't mind
getting him out of the way, would he?

1194
01:07:52,467 --> 01:07:55,251
Doc, how long would you say
this body has been here?

1195
01:07:55,351 --> 01:07:57,528
Can't say offhand,
at least a couple of months.

1196
01:07:57,628 --> 01:07:58,809
Couple of months?

1197
01:07:58,909 --> 01:08:01,530
That's just when Wynant closed the shop.

1198
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:02,888
That's an open book.

1199
01:08:02,988 --> 01:08:04,850
Wynant killed this guy
and planted him here.

1200
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:06,767
Julia knew about it, so he killed her.

1201
01:08:06,867 --> 01:08:09,740
And Nunheim caught him at that,
so he bumped him off.

1202
01:08:10,262 --> 01:08:13,769
Boys, I guess we'll be going along.
Nick, you did a swell job.

1203
01:08:13,869 --> 01:08:16,570
You wouldn't mind
paying me that $100 now, would you?

1204
01:08:16,671 --> 01:08:18,211
Wait until you catch Wynant.

1205
01:08:18,311 --> 01:08:19,691
I'll get him, all right.

1206
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:21,766
You can bring that stuff all out to the car.

1207
01:08:21,867 --> 01:08:24,209
- You'll run it through the fluoroscope?
- Yes.

1208
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:26,888
- Do you mind if I come down and see it?
- Not at all.

1209
01:08:26,988 --> 01:08:28,620
I'm very interested in that body.

1210
01:08:29,662 --> 01:08:31,937
Step right over here, Mr. Charles.

1211
01:08:34,462 --> 01:08:37,340
There's the bullet he was killed with, see?

1212
01:08:46,462 --> 01:08:47,895
What's that?

1213
01:08:49,701 --> 01:08:52,049
Just an old piece of shrapnel.

1214
01:08:52,149 --> 01:08:53,336
Shrapnel?

1215
01:08:53,782 --> 01:08:55,250
Maybe he was in the war.

1216
01:08:55,351 --> 01:08:57,449
That would account for
his cane and his limp.

1217
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:58,550
Yes.

1218
01:09:36,102 --> 01:09:38,247
Hey, doggie, come on.
Look down at the floor.

1219
01:09:38,347 --> 01:09:40,378
Come, look down at the body.

1220
01:09:40,741 --> 01:09:41,929
Now, Mr. Charles, this way, please.

1221
01:09:42,029 --> 01:09:43,528
- Get that out of here!
- Just a moment.

1222
01:09:43,628 --> 01:09:45,489
Mrs. Charles, this way, one family group.

1223
01:09:45,589 --> 01:09:47,168
It'll be lovely for the woman's page.

1224
01:09:47,268 --> 01:09:49,049
- Have the police an idea where Wynant is?
- No.

1225
01:09:49,149 --> 01:09:50,211
Do you think they'll find him?

1226
01:09:50,662 --> 01:09:51,769
I know they will.

1227
01:09:51,869 --> 01:09:53,730
- Got anything else to say about the case?
- No.

1228
01:09:53,830 --> 01:09:55,009
What about this Rosebreen?

1229
01:09:55,109 --> 01:09:56,687
Sorry, I don't know anything about it.

1230
01:09:56,788 --> 01:09:58,528
Can't you tell us anything about the case?

1231
01:09:58,628 --> 01:10:00,730
Yes, it's putting me
way behind in my drinking.

1232
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:02,568
- Let's get this in.
- Thanks, Nick.

1233
01:10:02,668 --> 01:10:04,168
What's your next step, Nick?

1234
01:10:04,268 --> 01:10:05,368
Right back to California.

1235
01:10:05,468 --> 01:10:07,250
We've got to rest up from this vacation.

1236
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:08,731
We'll see you before you go.

1237
01:10:08,831 --> 01:10:10,531
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye, boys.

1238
01:10:10,631 --> 01:10:11,975
Goodbye.

1239
01:10:18,502 --> 01:10:20,254
Back to California?

1240
01:10:21,182 --> 01:10:25,414
My soul, woman, I give you three murders,
and you're still not satisfied.

1241
01:10:28,222 --> 01:10:31,259
- Well, if you insist.
- Well, I don't insist.

1242
01:10:32,382 --> 01:10:34,607
No, I wanted you to stay here
and find Wynant.

1243
01:10:34,707 --> 01:10:37,129
- I did find him.
- What do you mean?

1244
01:10:37,229 --> 01:10:39,861
- He was down in his shop.
- Nick!

1245
01:10:40,182 --> 01:10:42,167
That was his body that was down there.

1246
01:10:42,267 --> 01:10:43,971
You'd better lay off that liquor.

1247
01:10:44,071 --> 01:10:45,541
That's a fact.

1248
01:10:45,702 --> 01:10:46,926
Wynant's body?

1249
01:10:47,026 --> 01:10:48,026
Yes.

1250
01:10:48,782 --> 01:10:50,447
Don't you want something to eat?

1251
01:10:50,548 --> 01:10:52,330
Everybody thought it was Rosebreen.

1252
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:54,769
That's what they think,
Guild and the rest of them.

1253
01:10:54,869 --> 01:10:58,609
They just take it for granted that
it's another one of Wynant's victims.

1254
01:10:58,709 --> 01:11:00,969
Guild's hot-footing around now
looking for Wynant.

1255
01:11:01,069 --> 01:11:02,371
That's all that troubles him.

1256
01:11:02,471 --> 01:11:04,489
What makes you so sure
it was Wynant's body?

1257
01:11:04,589 --> 01:11:06,211
Well, several things.

1258
01:11:06,311 --> 01:11:07,691
Hello, Fred?

1259
01:11:07,791 --> 01:11:09,294
We're hungry again.

1260
01:11:10,142 --> 01:11:11,568
And lots of onions.

1261
01:11:11,668 --> 01:11:13,248
And coffee.

1262
01:11:13,348 --> 01:11:15,333
You're driving me crazy. What things?

1263
01:11:15,902 --> 01:11:18,018
What things make you so sure?

1264
01:11:20,181 --> 01:11:22,049
Well, take the clothes, for instance.

1265
01:11:22,149 --> 01:11:23,808
They were very carefully preserved...

1266
01:11:23,908 --> 01:11:26,690
and the body was
just as carefully destroyed.

1267
01:11:26,791 --> 01:11:29,007
Whoever killed him
was counting on one thing...

1268
01:11:29,107 --> 01:11:31,247
that skeletons all look alike.

1269
01:11:31,347 --> 01:11:33,617
- Well, they do, don't they?
- Sure.

1270
01:11:33,942 --> 01:11:35,767
You won't get another swallow
until you say.

1271
01:11:35,867 --> 01:11:38,246
I happened to remember
he had shrapnel in his shin.

1272
01:11:38,346 --> 01:11:40,769
It bothered him.
I looked for it and found it. Give me.

1273
01:11:40,869 --> 01:11:43,326
- How long has he been dead?
- Couple of months.

1274
01:11:43,426 --> 01:11:45,567
Then he couldn't have
committed those murders.

1275
01:11:45,667 --> 01:11:47,407
Smart gal.

1276
01:11:47,507 --> 01:11:49,647
Wynant's dead. Does Dorothy know?

1277
01:11:49,747 --> 01:11:50,848
No, nobody knows but you.

1278
01:11:50,948 --> 01:11:52,580
I'm going to tell her.

1279
01:11:52,782 --> 01:11:53,968
You can't do that.

1280
01:11:54,069 --> 01:11:55,887
She's going crazy.
She'd rather know he was dead...

1281
01:11:55,987 --> 01:11:57,531
I can't help it! I can't tell a soul.

1282
01:11:57,631 --> 01:11:59,606
- I haven't even told Guild.
- Why?

1283
01:11:59,706 --> 01:12:01,847
I want to lie low
until I get the whole dope.

1284
01:12:01,947 --> 01:12:04,970
- I'm not going to go off half-cocked.
- What are you going to do?

1285
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:07,178
I'm going to get the murderer.

1286
01:12:07,702 --> 01:12:09,420
And I've got an idea.

1287
01:12:09,542 --> 01:12:12,010
- Do you want to see me take him?
- Yes.

1288
01:12:12,382 --> 01:12:15,171
- Have you a nice evening gown?
- What's that got to do with it?

1289
01:12:15,271 --> 01:12:16,928
Have you got a nice evening gown?

1290
01:12:17,028 --> 01:12:18,890
Yes, I've got a lulu. Why?

1291
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:21,807
I'm going to give a party
and invite all the suspects.

1292
01:12:21,908 --> 01:12:23,211
The suspects? They won't come.

1293
01:12:23,311 --> 01:12:24,771
Yes, they will.

1294
01:12:24,871 --> 01:12:27,209
I'll get Guild to issue the invitations.

1295
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:29,170
Who do you think did it?

1296
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:30,270
Mimi.

1297
01:12:30,629 --> 01:12:31,629
Mimi?

1298
01:12:31,749 --> 01:12:35,496
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner...

1299
01:12:36,182 --> 01:12:39,891
What were you doing
on the night of October 5, 1902?

1300
01:12:41,542 --> 01:12:44,932
I was just a gleam in my father's eye.

1301
01:12:52,782 --> 01:12:55,165
Now, let's see, you at the head.

1302
01:12:55,265 --> 01:12:56,570
And you on my right.

1303
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:57,769
Thank you.

1304
01:12:57,869 --> 01:12:59,890
I'll put MacCaulay here,
where he can help me.

1305
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:02,249
There ought to be a lady next to him.
I've got Mimi.

1306
01:13:02,349 --> 01:13:04,087
I don't think Mimi likes him.

1307
01:13:04,187 --> 01:13:05,405
Then it's Mimi.

1308
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:06,848
Who goes next to me?

1309
01:13:06,948 --> 01:13:09,128
Suppose you leave that open.
See what you draw.

1310
01:13:09,229 --> 01:13:10,851
Put Dorothy there.

1311
01:13:10,951 --> 01:13:12,086
And then Tommy?

1312
01:13:12,186 --> 01:13:14,290
No, I'll keep Tommy on this side.
Put Gilbert next.

1313
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,568
Nice boy. Who's next to Gilbert?

1314
01:13:16,668 --> 01:13:18,168
That bird that shot me.

1315
01:13:18,268 --> 01:13:20,529
Morelli? Well, this is going to be good.

1316
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:22,926
I'll put that slick gigolo husband
of Mimi's here.

1317
01:13:23,026 --> 01:13:24,890
- Have they found him?
- They found him.

1318
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:26,206
Who goes next to him?

1319
01:13:26,306 --> 01:13:29,527
I'm leaving that open.
I've a feeling that he won't come alone.

1320
01:13:29,627 --> 01:13:30,931
Where are you going to put Guild?

1321
01:13:31,031 --> 01:13:33,049
At the end,
where he can keep an eye on things.

1322
01:13:33,149 --> 01:13:35,367
That's the place for him
when the trouble starts.

1323
01:13:35,467 --> 01:13:39,688
And the little friend of Nunheim's,
the frying-pan juggler, there.

1324
01:13:39,788 --> 01:13:42,731
Nick, are you sure
one of these people is the killer?

1325
01:13:42,831 --> 01:13:43,886
Positive.

1326
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:47,010
Nick, I can't stand the suspense.
Which one of them did it?

1327
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:48,245
I wish you'd tell me.

1328
01:13:48,345 --> 01:13:49,890
I wish you'd tell me.

1329
01:13:49,991 --> 01:13:51,290
- Mr. Charles.
- Yes, Henri?

1330
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:53,729
I'm afraid these men
will interfere with your beautiful dinner.

1331
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:54,971
Really?

1332
01:13:55,902 --> 01:13:58,126
- How's it going, boys?
- Swell.

1333
01:13:58,226 --> 01:13:59,691
How's this?

1334
01:13:59,791 --> 01:14:01,659
Yes, <i>monsieur.</i>

1335
01:14:02,702 --> 01:14:03,845
Terrible.

1336
01:14:03,946 --> 01:14:05,969
That's all right.
Your men will serve the dinner.

1337
01:14:06,069 --> 01:14:07,966
These boys are just here in case.

1338
01:14:08,067 --> 01:14:09,691
I think they'll be all right.

1339
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,049
Hello, Mrs. Charles.

1340
01:14:11,149 --> 01:14:12,487
Hello, Mr. Guild.

1341
01:14:12,588 --> 01:14:14,168
Well, I see you're all set.

1342
01:14:14,268 --> 01:14:16,449
- Do you think they'll come?
- Most of them are here already.

1343
01:14:16,549 --> 01:14:18,607
The rest will be here.
Don't worry about that.

1344
01:14:18,707 --> 01:14:19,925
My men are picking them up.

1345
01:14:20,025 --> 01:14:22,326
- Bring them in, boys.
- You're a great help to a hostess.

1346
01:14:22,426 --> 01:14:24,088
I wish had you at all my dinner parties.

1347
01:14:24,188 --> 01:14:25,209
Welcome.

1348
01:14:25,309 --> 01:14:28,010
Let go of my arm, you big lug!
Say, what's the idea anyway?

1349
01:14:28,111 --> 01:14:30,689
I ain't done, nothing! It's you?

1350
01:14:30,789 --> 01:14:32,650
We only wanted you to dine with us.

1351
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,807
If you think I'm going to talk, you're crazy.

1352
01:14:34,907 --> 01:14:38,010
'Cause I was mixed up with a stool pigeon
don't mean I'm one, too!

1353
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:40,486
Absolutely not.
Will you show the lady a chair?

1354
01:14:40,586 --> 01:14:43,088
On your way, sister, on your way.

1355
01:14:43,189 --> 01:14:45,486
- Did you find Dorothy?
- She'll be here, don't worry.

1356
01:14:45,586 --> 01:14:47,087
What you need is a drink.

1357
01:14:47,187 --> 01:14:49,486
I'd think you guys would be tired
of picking me up.

1358
01:14:49,586 --> 01:14:51,407
- Pipe down.
- Step this way, kid.

1359
01:14:51,507 --> 01:14:52,848
- What's up?
- Come on.

1360
01:14:52,948 --> 01:14:55,288
- Outrageous!
- How do you do, Mrs. Jorgensen?

1361
01:14:55,389 --> 01:14:58,969
- How dare you send a detective after us?
- We wanted to be sure you'd get here.

1362
01:14:59,069 --> 01:15:01,249
I told him we couldn't come.
We have an engagement.

1363
01:15:01,349 --> 01:15:02,566
We're going to the theater.

1364
01:15:02,666 --> 01:15:04,529
Nicky's putting on a little show of his own.

1365
01:15:04,629 --> 01:15:07,614
You must stay.
Please, come and have a cocktail.

1366
01:15:09,742 --> 01:15:11,807
- What's the gag?
- You know as much as I do.

1367
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:14,771
- Have a cocktail.
- No, I don't care for any.

1368
01:15:14,871 --> 01:15:18,741
- I said, have a cocktail!
- I guess he wants us to have a cocktail.

1369
01:15:20,742 --> 01:15:22,175
Hi, MacCaulay.

1370
01:15:22,662 --> 01:15:25,611
Take off your hat and coat
and join our festivities.

1371
01:15:25,711 --> 01:15:27,287
Why, Tanner, what's this?

1372
01:15:27,387 --> 01:15:29,527
They had me in jail last night,
Mr. MacCaulay.

1373
01:15:29,627 --> 01:15:31,091
Don't think a thing of it.

1374
01:15:31,191 --> 01:15:32,528
Come in. Take off your things.

1375
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:33,967
What is it, Mr. Charles?

1376
01:15:34,068 --> 01:15:36,207
I wanted you to be here.
I've got something, I think.

1377
01:15:36,307 --> 01:15:37,366
Come in, Tanner.

1378
01:15:37,466 --> 01:15:38,686
- Where's Dorothy?
- I don't know.

1379
01:15:38,786 --> 01:15:40,447
I thought she was with you.
She left this afternoon.

1380
01:15:40,547 --> 01:15:43,136
No, she wasn't with me. Here she is now.

1381
01:15:43,382 --> 01:15:45,607
We got them. Picked them up
at the Pennsylvania Station.

1382
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:46,809
Come on in.

1383
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:48,568
- Hello, Nick.
- Dorothy.

1384
01:15:48,668 --> 01:15:50,892
- A party?
- Yes.

1385
01:15:51,502 --> 01:15:53,327
Celebrating Father's third murder?

1386
01:15:53,427 --> 01:15:56,291
- They were making a getaway.
- We were doing nothing of the sort.

1387
01:15:56,391 --> 01:15:57,808
You can't get away with this.

1388
01:15:57,908 --> 01:16:01,126
How right you are.
Take this gentleman's hat and coat.

1389
01:16:01,227 --> 01:16:02,728
Music! Much music!

1390
01:16:02,828 --> 01:16:06,488
You know, Nick interrupted me
at a very important time of my life.

1391
01:16:06,589 --> 01:16:09,654
I was just about to take my first false step.

1392
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:11,328
I'm getting out of here.

1393
01:16:11,428 --> 01:16:12,768
No, you stay here.

1394
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:15,491
If I stay,
I know I'm going to take a poke at him.

1395
01:16:15,591 --> 01:16:17,618
Then I insist you stay.

1396
01:16:18,582 --> 01:16:20,008
Here's Jorgensen.

1397
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:21,421
Why, Chris!

1398
01:16:21,782 --> 01:16:24,166
How do you do? I'm Nick Charles.

1399
01:16:24,266 --> 01:16:26,769
- Chris, where have you been?
- None of your business.

1400
01:16:26,869 --> 01:16:30,369
Chris, I swear it isn't my fault.
I tried to keep you out of this.

1401
01:16:30,469 --> 01:16:32,338
Take your hands off him.

1402
01:16:32,901 --> 01:16:34,381
Do you hear me?

1403
01:16:35,142 --> 01:16:36,530
Chris, what does this mean?

1404
01:16:36,631 --> 01:16:39,767
Sorry we were late,
but we had to break down the door.

1405
01:16:39,867 --> 01:16:41,580
Chris, how could you?

1406
01:16:42,982 --> 01:16:44,488
Do come in
and make yourselves comfortable.

1407
01:16:44,588 --> 01:16:46,379
Just take the gentleman's hat and coat.

1408
01:16:46,782 --> 01:16:48,090
Come, friends, and get it.

1409
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:50,050
Tommy, how would you like
to be end man?

1410
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:52,568
Mr. Jorgensen, next to Tommy, if you will.

1411
01:16:52,669 --> 01:16:54,929
Dorothy, I believe you and Mr. Quinn
are over here.

1412
01:16:55,029 --> 01:16:56,927
MacCaulay, here if you will.

1413
01:16:57,027 --> 01:16:59,006
Tanner, down there.

1414
01:16:59,107 --> 01:17:01,696
Mrs. Jorgensen, next to Mr. Jorgensen.

1415
01:17:02,782 --> 01:17:04,208
I'm Mrs. Jorgensen!

1416
01:17:04,308 --> 01:17:07,208
Put it over there, sister.
I was Mrs. Jorgensen before you were.

1417
01:17:07,308 --> 01:17:09,862
Mimi, you're here.

1418
01:17:11,302 --> 01:17:15,006
Waiter, will you remove
the illumination, please?

1419
01:17:15,106 --> 01:17:17,332
Ladies and gentlemen, be seated.

1420
01:17:19,382 --> 01:17:22,171
Now, my friends,
if I may propose a little toast.

1421
01:17:22,271 --> 01:17:26,892
Let us eat, drink and be merry,
for tomorrow, we die.

1422
01:17:28,302 --> 01:17:31,170
You give such charming parties,
Mr. Charles.

1423
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:32,486
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.

1424
01:17:32,586 --> 01:17:35,169
Perhaps you'll tell us now why we're here.

1425
01:17:35,269 --> 01:17:38,379
We're here because
I have some very important news.

1426
01:17:38,502 --> 01:17:39,646
What is it?

1427
01:17:39,746 --> 01:17:40,848
Just this.

1428
01:17:40,949 --> 01:17:43,970
Clyde Wynant did not kill Julia.
He didn't kill Nunheim or anyone.

1429
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:45,850
What are you talking about?
It's in the papers.

1430
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:47,251
You mean, he didn't kill them?

1431
01:17:47,351 --> 01:17:49,450
- What did I tell you?
- Is that why you brought us?

1432
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:50,649
I'd like to believe that.

1433
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:53,611
- I knew they'd pull some monkey business.
- With money, you can do anything.

1434
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:55,686
Quiet, let him have his say out.

1435
01:17:55,786 --> 01:17:57,447
What makes you say that, Nick?

1436
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:59,010
I saw him last night.

1437
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:00,165
- Where, Nick?
- You did?

1438
01:18:00,266 --> 01:18:02,087
That's nothing. I saw him myself.

1439
01:18:02,187 --> 01:18:03,528
You see? I told you.

1440
01:18:03,628 --> 01:18:05,847
- That's a hot one.
- What did I say? It's a frame-up.

1441
01:18:05,947 --> 01:18:07,730
Quiet. When did you see him?

1442
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:09,850
Last night.
He came to see me in my apartment.

1443
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:12,289
Is that so? What did he say?

1444
01:18:12,389 --> 01:18:13,649
Nothing much.

1445
01:18:13,749 --> 01:18:16,407
He wanted to know how I was
and how the children were.

1446
01:18:16,507 --> 01:18:18,220
What kind of clothes was he wearing?

1447
01:18:19,022 --> 01:18:22,492
A brown suit, brown shoes, a white shirt...

1448
01:18:22,622 --> 01:18:26,297
a grayish tie with reddish-brown,
or brownish-red, dots in it.

1449
01:18:26,542 --> 01:18:28,330
- Tell them, Ed.
- I saw him, too.

1450
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:30,290
He was wearing a green suit
and a white tie...

1451
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:32,728
What are you saying?
You weren't even there.

1452
01:18:32,828 --> 01:18:34,131
I know, but I saw him.

1453
01:18:34,231 --> 01:18:37,692
- Where did you see him?
- I was gazing in my crystal.

1454
01:18:40,582 --> 01:18:42,812
Waiter, will you serve the nuts?

1455
01:18:43,582 --> 01:18:46,046
I mean, will you serve the guests the nuts?

1456
01:18:46,146 --> 01:18:48,257
Mimi, I'm afraid you're lying.

1457
01:18:48,382 --> 01:18:50,766
You see, I really did see Wynant last night.

1458
01:18:50,866 --> 01:18:52,687
- Are you kidding?
- No.

1459
01:18:52,787 --> 01:18:55,650
- What's the idea of holding out on me?
- You saw him yourself.

1460
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:56,966
I saw him?

1461
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:58,770
That was his body buried in the shop.

1462
01:18:58,871 --> 01:18:59,871
Nick!

1463
01:19:00,308 --> 01:19:03,650
It's terrible to have to tell you this way,
but your father is dead.

1464
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:05,619
He's been dead for three months.

1465
01:19:07,901 --> 01:19:09,967
Pardon me,
you have something on your coat.

1466
01:19:10,067 --> 01:19:12,648
- Darling, please don't cry.
- Tommy!

1467
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:14,929
It's terrible, I know,
but isn't it better that way?

1468
01:19:15,029 --> 01:19:17,092
Here, I'll take care of her.

1469
01:19:19,942 --> 01:19:23,981
- Tommy, you sit here.
- Waiter, will you kindly remove that?

1470
01:19:25,502 --> 01:19:27,174
What, no one eating?

1471
01:19:27,902 --> 01:19:29,647
Mimi, it hasn't affected your appetite.

1472
01:19:29,747 --> 01:19:32,205
Because I don't believe a word of it.
What's your proof?

1473
01:19:32,306 --> 01:19:34,047
A piece of shrapnel in his shin.

1474
01:19:34,147 --> 01:19:35,611
If he didn't do it, who did?

1475
01:19:35,711 --> 01:19:39,820
The murderer is right in this room,
sitting at this table.

1476
01:19:40,141 --> 01:19:41,568
You may serve the fish.

1477
01:19:41,668 --> 01:19:43,770
- At this table?
- Eat something, you fool.

1478
01:19:43,870 --> 01:19:46,650
- Well, aren't you going to tell us who it is?
- I don't know.

1479
01:19:46,751 --> 01:19:48,929
I thought,
if we all had a little get-together...

1480
01:19:49,029 --> 01:19:50,660
we might be able to find out.

1481
01:19:51,182 --> 01:19:52,651
Nice food, isn't it?

1482
01:19:52,751 --> 01:19:55,619
Yes, it's the best dinner I ever listened to.

1483
01:19:56,422 --> 01:19:59,811
You say you don't know who did it,
but who do you think?

1484
01:20:03,062 --> 01:20:04,408
Morelli...

1485
01:20:04,508 --> 01:20:06,370
- You can't pin this one on me!
- Sit down!

1486
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:08,969
- Am I the fall guy?
- Sit down, or I'll use a sap on you.

1487
01:20:09,069 --> 01:20:10,967
I only want to ask you a question.

1488
01:20:11,067 --> 01:20:13,496
- Morelli, you knew Julia.
- Yeah.

1489
01:20:13,782 --> 01:20:15,287
Was she gypping Wynant?

1490
01:20:15,388 --> 01:20:17,729
- She don't say so, but I figure.
- Why do you say that?

1491
01:20:17,829 --> 01:20:21,170
Well, once I wanted $5,000,
she give it to me like that, cash.

1492
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:22,449
Thanks.

1493
01:20:22,549 --> 01:20:23,931
Three months ago...

1494
01:20:24,031 --> 01:20:27,450
the night that Wynant caught you
in Julia's apartment, Morelli...

1495
01:20:27,550 --> 01:20:31,007
he discovered that Julia was cheating
on him and splitting with some man.

1496
01:20:31,107 --> 01:20:32,528
That man was...

1497
01:20:32,628 --> 01:20:33,850
Tanner...

1498
01:20:35,022 --> 01:20:37,172
I'm so sorry, Tanner.

1499
01:20:37,782 --> 01:20:39,208
Don't you want some wine?

1500
01:20:39,308 --> 01:20:42,090
No, really, Mr. Charles,
I had nothing to do with this.

1501
01:20:42,190 --> 01:20:45,491
- I told you...
- That's all right, Tanner, that's all right.

1502
01:20:45,822 --> 01:20:47,699
You're driving me crazy.

1503
01:20:48,742 --> 01:20:50,572
Now, let me see, where was I?

1504
01:20:50,901 --> 01:20:52,095
Oh, yes.

1505
01:20:52,502 --> 01:20:56,256
Wynant went to find the man
he accused of having cheated him.

1506
01:20:56,702 --> 01:20:59,650
That man, knowing that he was caught
dead to rights...

1507
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:03,046
and with prison staring him in the face,
took the only way out.

1508
01:21:03,146 --> 01:21:04,700
He killed Wynant.

1509
01:21:05,222 --> 01:21:06,648
- Mr. Jorgensen?
- Yes?

1510
01:21:06,748 --> 01:21:08,850
You're not eating.
Don't you care for oysters?

1511
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:12,290
Why, I was just listening
to what you had to say.

1512
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:13,390
Good.

1513
01:21:15,342 --> 01:21:17,537
This murderer is very clever.

1514
01:21:18,422 --> 01:21:21,334
He studied this whole thing out
very carefully.

1515
01:21:21,702 --> 01:21:23,649
You'd understand that,
wouldn't you, Gilbert?

1516
01:21:23,749 --> 01:21:25,284
Yes! No!

1517
01:21:26,182 --> 01:21:28,731
He planned the whole thing beautifully.

1518
01:21:28,831 --> 01:21:30,088
After he killed Wynant...

1519
01:21:30,188 --> 01:21:31,928
he wired MacCaulay
using Wynant's name...

1520
01:21:32,028 --> 01:21:34,486
- and told him to close up the shop.
- Which I did.

1521
01:21:34,586 --> 01:21:36,061
Naturally.

1522
01:21:37,102 --> 01:21:41,088
Then he destroyed all of Wynant's clothes,
with the exception of his watch chain.

1523
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:43,689
He figured that someday
that might come in handy.

1524
01:21:43,789 --> 01:21:47,050
Then he took Wynant's body
and buried it with another man's clothes...

1525
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:49,771
a fat man's clothes,
to throw us off the track.

1526
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:52,245
He even put in a belt buckle
with an "R" on it...

1527
01:21:52,346 --> 01:21:54,167
hoping we would think
it was Rosebreen...

1528
01:21:54,267 --> 01:21:57,537
an old enemy of Wynant's
who disappeared years ago.

1529
01:21:57,981 --> 01:22:01,888
Morelli, would you mind
holding your knife some other way?

1530
01:22:01,988 --> 01:22:03,893
You're worrying Gilbert.

1531
01:22:07,102 --> 01:22:10,492
If that knife is missing,
I'll look for it in your back.

1532
01:22:11,182 --> 01:22:14,768
After our hero had killed Wynant,
he had a brilliant idea.

1533
01:22:14,869 --> 01:22:17,928
He realized that he and Julia
could still collect money.

1534
01:22:18,028 --> 01:22:20,609
Wynant was supposed to be out of town,
no one knew where.

1535
01:22:20,709 --> 01:22:23,651
So our hero wrote letters to MacCaulay,
signing Wynant's name...

1536
01:22:23,751 --> 01:22:26,531
so that MacCaulay would continue
to send the money to Julia.

1537
01:22:26,631 --> 01:22:28,011
He even telephoned MacCaulay.

1538
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:29,688
You remember that first day
you came to see me?

1539
01:22:29,788 --> 01:22:30,969
He telephoned he was in town?

1540
01:22:31,069 --> 01:22:32,370
Yes, he called while I was out.

1541
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:34,287
Yeah, wasn't he slick about that?

1542
01:22:34,387 --> 01:22:37,374
That same afternoon,
Julia telephoned him.

1543
01:22:38,702 --> 01:22:40,368
She said you were coming, Mimi.

1544
01:22:40,468 --> 01:22:43,048
- I wanted to ask about Mr. Wynant.
- Exactly.

1545
01:22:43,148 --> 01:22:45,089
And our hero got terrified.

1546
01:22:45,190 --> 01:22:49,087
He was afraid Julia would break down
and tell you that he had murdered Wynant.

1547
01:22:49,187 --> 01:22:51,980
So he went to Julia, and he killed her.

1548
01:22:52,662 --> 01:22:55,249
And he left Wynant's watch chain
in her hand.

1549
01:22:55,349 --> 01:22:57,166
- Is this true?
- I don't know.

1550
01:22:57,266 --> 01:23:00,051
- Then why are you saying it?
- It's the only way it makes sense.

1551
01:23:00,151 --> 01:23:01,814
I hope you're well.

1552
01:23:03,782 --> 01:23:06,057
His plan was working beautifully.

1553
01:23:06,302 --> 01:23:09,055
Everybody believed
that Wynant was in town...

1554
01:23:09,382 --> 01:23:10,526
and that he had done it.

1555
01:23:10,626 --> 01:23:12,532
There was just one hitch.

1556
01:23:12,782 --> 01:23:15,216
A bird named Nunheim, your friend.

1557
01:23:15,462 --> 01:23:17,410
Nunheim had gone to call on her.

1558
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:20,380
He heard the shots.
He saw the murderer leave.

1559
01:23:20,702 --> 01:23:21,809
He knew who did it.

1560
01:23:21,909 --> 01:23:25,451
If he knew, he didn't tell me!
You can't drag me into this!

1561
01:23:26,342 --> 01:23:29,007
Our hero had paid Nunheim once
to keep his mouth shut.

1562
01:23:29,107 --> 01:23:32,051
And when Nunheim threatened him again,
he bumped him off.

1563
01:23:32,151 --> 01:23:33,568
He was very clever.

1564
01:23:33,668 --> 01:23:37,046
Everybody, even our astute friend Guild,
thought that Wynant was alive...

1565
01:23:37,147 --> 01:23:38,366
and that he was the murderer.

1566
01:23:38,466 --> 01:23:39,781
You can skip that.

1567
01:23:39,982 --> 01:23:43,019
But our hero had just one
weak link in his chain.

1568
01:23:43,741 --> 01:23:46,206
The telegrams and phone calls
were all very well...

1569
01:23:46,306 --> 01:23:48,367
but no one had actually seen Wynant.

1570
01:23:48,467 --> 01:23:52,011
So our hero picked on poor Mimi here
to strengthen his case.

1571
01:23:52,142 --> 01:23:55,926
Mimi is the only one at this table
who can tell us who the real murderer is.

1572
01:23:56,026 --> 01:23:59,406
Mimi, who was it who told you
to say you saw Wynant?

1573
01:23:59,507 --> 01:24:03,249
- Nobody told me, I did see him!
- Why don't you let my mother alone?

1574
01:24:03,349 --> 01:24:05,130
What were you paid to stick to that story?

1575
01:24:05,230 --> 01:24:07,930
It isn't a story, it's true!
I did see him! He isn't dead!

1576
01:24:08,031 --> 01:24:09,129
You're lying, Mimi.

1577
01:24:09,229 --> 01:24:10,931
But you'd do anything for money.

1578
01:24:11,031 --> 01:24:13,406
You're getting a good price
for saying you saw Wynant.

1579
01:24:13,506 --> 01:24:15,327
You figure you won't get anything
if he's dead.

1580
01:24:15,427 --> 01:24:17,769
- I'm not going to stay here to be insulted!
- Sit down.

1581
01:24:17,869 --> 01:24:19,846
MacCaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.

1582
01:24:19,947 --> 01:24:21,970
Mimi was cut off, wasn't she,
if she remarried?

1583
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:23,328
I have no right to answer that.

1584
01:24:23,428 --> 01:24:25,326
- How about it, Tanner? Isn't that true?
- Yes.

1585
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:27,848
You shouldn't let that keep you
from telling the truth.

1586
01:24:27,948 --> 01:24:29,368
- Mrs. Jorgensen.
- Yes?

1587
01:24:29,468 --> 01:24:31,287
Were you ever divorced
from Chris Jorgensen?

1588
01:24:31,387 --> 01:24:32,387
No.

1589
01:24:32,546 --> 01:24:35,171
So you see, Mimi,
under the law, you've never remarried.

1590
01:24:35,271 --> 01:24:38,087
You're still one of the heirs.
So what are you holding out for?

1591
01:24:38,188 --> 01:24:41,088
A few crummy dollars,
when you can get the whole estate?

1592
01:24:41,188 --> 01:24:43,891
Remember the other two
who were mixed in with him on this...

1593
01:24:43,991 --> 01:24:45,169
Julia and Nunheim.

1594
01:24:45,269 --> 01:24:47,769
When he thought they might
spill something, he bumped them off.

1595
01:24:47,869 --> 01:24:50,246
You ought to know he's not going
to take any chances on you.

1596
01:24:50,346 --> 01:24:52,087
What do you want to do,
be next on his list?

1597
01:24:52,188 --> 01:24:54,218
Why, you dirty little...

1598
01:24:55,582 --> 01:24:58,247
- Well, there's your murderer: MacCaulay.
- MacCaulay?

1599
01:24:58,348 --> 01:25:00,450
Sure, do you want me
to wrap him up in cellophane?

1600
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:01,931
Get in there! What's the matter?

1601
01:25:02,031 --> 01:25:04,167
MacCaulay? I can't believe it!

1602
01:25:04,267 --> 01:25:06,210
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle!

1603
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:07,887
Nicky, he might have killed you!

1604
01:25:07,987 --> 01:25:09,568
What's the matter? You sorry he didn't?

1605
01:25:09,668 --> 01:25:11,892
I'm glad you're not a detective.

1606
01:25:14,982 --> 01:25:16,859
Not a hip in a carload.

1607
01:25:17,542 --> 01:25:19,410
Well, here's to you two!

1608
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:21,220
And to you two, too!

1609
01:25:26,342 --> 01:25:28,730
- Why, the rat, he can't top us.
- No.

1610
01:25:31,702 --> 01:25:33,693
- Shall I keep these fresh for you?
- Yes.

1611
01:25:36,582 --> 01:25:38,690
My gracious, it's 1:00.

1612
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:40,649
- It's what?
- It's 1:00.

1613
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:42,451
No, baby, it's 11:00.

1614
01:25:42,551 --> 01:25:44,692
It is not, it's 1:00. I set my watch ahead.

1615
01:25:44,822 --> 01:25:47,047
Yeah, you set your watch ahead
at 12:00, didn't you?

1616
01:25:47,147 --> 01:25:50,686
Look, you're in New York, for instance.
The sun rises in New York.

1617
01:25:50,786 --> 01:25:52,767
San Francisco is
3,000 miles west of New York.

1618
01:25:52,867 --> 01:25:53,969
You're wrong!

1619
01:25:54,069 --> 01:25:57,338
The sun does not get to San Francisco
till three hours after New York.

1620
01:25:58,382 --> 01:25:59,445
Yes, baby?

1621
01:25:59,545 --> 01:26:01,498
Does that mean that it's bedtime?

1622
01:26:02,382 --> 01:26:04,293
Well, that's a thought.

1623
01:26:06,782 --> 01:26:08,606
Come on, sugar, leave us do it.

1624
01:26:08,707 --> 01:26:10,772
Asta, are you ready?

1625
01:26:12,622 --> 01:26:17,138
- And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.
- Same to you, Nick.

1626
01:26:17,382 --> 01:26:18,525
Good night.

1627
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:20,368
I can never thank you for all you've done.

1628
01:26:20,468 --> 01:26:21,569
Don't be silly.

1629
01:26:21,669 --> 01:26:23,573
- Good night.
- Good night.

1630
01:26:27,781 --> 01:26:30,535
Gosh, darling,
I thought they'd never leave.

1631
01:26:32,102 --> 01:26:34,049
I thought you'd never leave.

1632
01:26:34,149 --> 01:26:38,287
Baby, the sun rises in the east,
it sets in the west.

1633
01:26:38,387 --> 01:26:40,477
If it's 12:00 in New York,
automatically, it's...

1634
01:26:40,577 --> 01:26:43,181
Nicky, put Asta in here with me tonight.

1635
01:26:44,781 --> 01:26:46,010
Oh, yeah?

1636
