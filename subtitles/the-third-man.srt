2
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,076
I never knew the old Vienna before the war...

3
00:02:48,153 --> 00:02:50,314
with its Strauss music,
its glamor and easy charm.

4
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:53,050
Constantinople
suited me better.

5
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:57,561
I really got to know it in
the classic period of the black market.

6
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,598
We'd run anything if people wanted it
enough and had the money to pay.

7
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,601
Of course, a situation like that
does tempt amateurs...

8
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:06,728
but, you know, they can't stay
the course like a professional.

9
00:03:06,804 --> 00:03:10,036
Now the city, it's divided
into four zones, you know,

10
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:13,840
each occupied by a power... the American,
the British, the Russian and the French.

11
00:03:13,912 --> 00:03:16,381
But the center of the city,
that's international,

12
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:19,382
policed by an international patrol,
one member of each of the four powers.

13
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:23,046
Wonderful! What a hope they had,
all strangers to the place...

14
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:25,419
and none of them
could speak the same language,

15
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,084
except a sort of smattering
of German.

16
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,391
Good fellows, on the whole.
Did their best, you know.

17
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:35,228
Vienna doesn't really look any worse than a lot
of other European cities. Bombed about a bit.

18
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,429
Oh, wait. I was gonna tell you
about Holly Martins,

19
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:41,597
an American, came all the way
here to visit a friend of his.

20
00:03:41,673 --> 00:03:43,869
The name was Lime.
Harry Lime.

21
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:47,071
Now, Martins was broke, and Lime
had offered him some sort of a job.

22
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:51,411
Anyway, there he was, poor chap,
happy as a lark and without a cent.

23
00:04:02,794 --> 00:04:04,887
- Passport, please.
- Oh.

24
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:08,091
- What's the purpose of your visit here?
- A friend offered me a job.

25
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,930
- Where are you staying?
- With him. 15 Stiffgasse.

26
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:13,163
- His name?
- Lime. Harry Lime.

27
00:04:13,238 --> 00:04:16,229
- Okay.
- Thought he'd be here to meet me.

28
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,809
- Speak English?
- English?

29
00:04:55,881 --> 00:05:01,342
A little, little.

30
00:05:04,523 --> 00:05:06,991
Ten minutes too late.

31
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:09,357
- Already gone.
- Who?

32
00:05:09,427 --> 00:05:13,056
Mmm, his friends
and, uh, no...

33
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:16,100
- Uh, coffin.
- Coffin?

34
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:18,294
Mr. Lime's.
An accident.

35
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:22,203
Knocked over by a car,
here in front of the house.

36
00:05:22,273 --> 00:05:26,573
Have seen it myself.
Killed at once, immediately.

37
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:31,172
Already in hell...
or in heaven.

38
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:36,347
Sorry for the gravediggers.
Hard work. It is frost.

39
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:51,229
Can you tell me, uh,
who's the...

40
00:05:51,302 --> 00:05:53,532
A fellow called Lime.

41
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:25,797
Like a lift to town?
I've got a car here.

42
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:33,938
Thanks.

43
00:07:42,181 --> 00:07:45,047
- My name's Calloway.
- Martins.

44
00:07:45,117 --> 00:07:48,109
- You a friend of Lime?
- Yeah.

45
00:07:48,186 --> 00:07:51,622
- Been here long?
- No.

46
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:03,794
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't
you? You could do with a drink.

47
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:06,770
- Could you buy me one?
- Of course.

48
00:08:06,838 --> 00:08:08,898
- Thanks.
- Schmolka?

49
00:08:08,974 --> 00:08:13,672
I guess nobody knew Harry
like he did, or like I did.

50
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:17,908
- How long ago?
- Back in school.

51
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:21,419
I was never so lonesome
in my life till he showed up.

52
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:24,011
- When did you see him last?
- September, '39.

53
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:26,148
- When the business started?
- Mm-hmm.

54
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:28,386
- See much of him before that?
- Once in a while.

55
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,225
- Best friend I ever had.
- That sounds like a cheap novelette.

56
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:37,599
Well, I write cheap novelettes.

57
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,763
I'm afraid I've never heard of you.
What's your name again?

58
00:08:40,838 --> 00:08:43,239
- Holly Martins.
- No, sorry.

59
00:08:43,307 --> 00:08:46,436
You ever hear of
The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?

60
00:08:46,511 --> 00:08:48,604
Can't say that I have.

61
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:52,047
Death at Double-X Ranch?
Uh, raunch.

62
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:55,086
Nope.

63
00:08:55,152 --> 00:08:59,020
He must've known I was broke.
He even sent me an airplane ticket.

64
00:08:59,091 --> 00:09:01,889
- It's a shame.
- What?

65
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,952
Him dying like that.

66
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,623
Best thing that
ever happened to him.

67
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:09,791
What are you trying to say?

68
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:12,530
He was about the worst
racketeer in this city.

69
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:15,868
- Policeman, huh?
- Come on, have another drink.

70
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,467
No, I never did like policemen.
I have to call them sheriffs.

71
00:09:19,544 --> 00:09:22,444
- Ever seen one?
- Pin it on a dead man.

72
00:09:22,514 --> 00:09:26,814
Some petty racket
with gasoline or something.

73
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:30,911
Just like a cop.
You're a real cop, I suppose.

74
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:34,117
- It wasn't petrol.
- So it wasn't petrol.

75
00:09:34,192 --> 00:09:37,059
So it was tires
or saccharin or...

76
00:09:37,128 --> 00:09:40,291
Why don't you catch
a few murderers for a change?

77
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:43,664
Well, you could say that murder
was part of his racket.

78
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:49,506
It's all right, Paine. He's only
a scribbler with too much drink in him.

79
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:52,098
Take Mr. Holly Martins home.

80
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:56,112
Holly Martins, sir?
The, uh, the writer?

81
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,615
The author of
Death at Double-X Ranch?

82
00:09:58,684 --> 00:10:01,243
- Listen, Callaghan...
- Calloway. I'm English.

83
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:04,255
You're not going to close your
files at a dead man's expense.

84
00:10:04,323 --> 00:10:08,088
So you're going to find me the real criminal?
Sounds like one of your stories.

85
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,753
When I'm finished with you,
you'll leave Vienna.

86
00:10:10,828 --> 00:10:13,764
Here's some army money. It should see
you through tonight at Sacher's Hotel,

87
00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:16,198
if you don't drink too much
in the bar.

88
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:19,031
We'll keep a seat for you
on tomorrow's plane.

89
00:10:23,107 --> 00:10:26,804
Please be careful, sir.
Up we come.

90
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,870
- Written anything lately?
- Take him to Sacher's.

91
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:32,347
Don't hit him again
if he behaves.

92
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,214
And you go carefully there.
It's a military hotel.

93
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:39,621
I'm so glad to have met you, sir.
I've read quite a few of your books.

94
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,454
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- I like a good western.

95
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:46,019
That's what I like about them. You can
pick them up and put them down anytime.

96
00:10:46,097 --> 00:10:48,031
- Oh, Mr. Hartman?
- Yes, sir?

97
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:50,625
Mr. Calloway said this gentleman's
got to have a room for the night.

98
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:52,636
Passport, please.

99
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:56,002
Can't very well
introduce you to everybody.

100
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,906
Would you mind
filling this in?

101
00:10:58,977 --> 00:11:00,967
- Mr. Crabbin.
- What is it, sergeant?

102
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:03,173
- Mr. Holly Martins, the author.
- Who?

103
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,647
- Thought you might be interested.
- Never heard of him.

104
00:11:05,717 --> 00:11:08,651
He's very good, sir.
I've read quite a few of his books.

105
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:11,985
Author? Martins?
Thank you, sergeant.

106
00:11:12,057 --> 00:11:15,150
Mr. Martins?
My name's Crabbin.

107
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:17,889
I represent
the C.R.S. of G.H.Q.

108
00:11:17,963 --> 00:11:21,057
- You do?
- Yes. Cultural Reeducation Section.

109
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:23,658
Propaganda. Very important
in a place like this.

110
00:11:23,735 --> 00:11:26,669
We do a little show each week.
Last week we had Hamlet.

111
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:29,467
The week before
we had... something.

112
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,476
- The striptease, sir.
- Yes, the Hindu dancers. Thank you.

113
00:11:32,544 --> 00:11:35,512
This is the first opportunity
of making an American author welcome.

114
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,877
- Welcome?
- I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins.

115
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:41,817
On Wednesday night, we're having
a little lecture on the contemporary novel.

116
00:11:41,886 --> 00:11:44,856
- Thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
- They wouldn't know me.

117
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:47,857
Nonsense. Your novels are very
popular here. Aren't they, sergeant?

118
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:50,689
- Very popular.
- Are you staying long?

119
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:53,697
How long can one stay here
on this stage money?

120
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:56,597
Listen, Mr. Martins,
if you'd agree to be our guest,

121
00:11:56,668 --> 00:11:59,363
we'd be delighted to have you.

122
00:11:59,438 --> 00:12:01,770
- Would you?
- As long as you care to stay.

123
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,275
- He's due to leave tomorrow.
- Have you got a toothache.

124
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:08,243
- Number 8, Mr. Martins.
- Come upstairs a moment.

125
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:09,332
I know a very good dentist.

126
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,372
I don't need a dentist.
Somebody hit me, that's all.

127
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:14,442
Goodness. We must report that.
Were they trying to rob you?

128
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,453
Oh, just a soldier. I was trying
to punch his major in the eye.

129
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:20,285
- A major? Were you really?
- Heard of Harry Lime?

130
00:12:20,357 --> 00:12:22,519
I've heard of him,
but I didn't exactly know him.

131
00:12:22,593 --> 00:12:24,884
I was going to stay with him,
but he died Thursday.

132
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:26,030
Goodness, that's awkward.

133
00:12:26,097 --> 00:12:29,625
Is that what you say to people after
death? Goodness, that's awkward?

134
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,136
- Mr. Martins? Excuse me. Telephone.
- Who is it?

135
00:12:33,204 --> 00:12:37,402
- Baron Kurtz.
- Must be some mistake. Yes?

136
00:12:37,476 --> 00:12:40,001
I was a friend of Harry Lime.

137
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,241
I'd very much like to meet you, Baron.
Come around.

138
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:45,805
Austrians aren't allowed
in your hotel.

139
00:12:45,884 --> 00:12:48,545
- Couldn't we meet at the Mozart Cafe?
- Where?

140
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,554
- Just around the corner.
- How will I know you?

141
00:12:51,622 --> 00:12:55,820
I'll carry a copy of one of your books.
Harry gave it to me.

142
00:12:55,894 --> 00:12:58,521
Be there in a moment.
Wait a minute.

143
00:12:58,597 --> 00:13:01,259
If I do this lecture business,
you'll put me up here a while?

144
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,266
- Certainly.
- It's a deal.

145
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:06,429
- Did you ever read The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?
- No, not that one.

146
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:09,804
It's a story about a man who hunted down
a sheriff who was victimizing his best friend.

147
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,900
- Seems exciting.
- It is.

148
00:13:11,977 --> 00:13:15,174
I'm gunning just the same way
for your Major Callaghan.

149
00:13:15,246 --> 00:13:17,271
Sounds anti-British, sir.

150
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:33,462
- Baron Kurtz?
- Mr. Martins?

151
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:36,990
Delighted to meet you.
Come, let's sit down here.

152
00:13:39,103 --> 00:13:41,833
- What would you like? Tea? Coffee?
- Coffee.

153
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:46,968
It's wonderful how
you keep the tension.

154
00:13:47,044 --> 00:13:48,671
- Tension?
- Suspense.

155
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:50,225
You really liked it?

156
00:13:50,226 --> 00:13:53,184
At the end of every chapter
you are left guessing.

157
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:55,515
So, you were
a friend of Harry's?

158
00:13:55,587 --> 00:13:58,852
I think his best.
Except you, of course.

159
00:13:58,924 --> 00:14:03,759
The police have a crazy notion that he
was mixed up in some sort of a racket.

160
00:14:03,828 --> 00:14:09,198
Everyone in Vienna is. We all sell
cigarettes and that kind of thing.

161
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:14,203
I tell you, I've done things that would
have seemed unthinkable before the war.

162
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:19,208
Once when I was hard up,
I sold some tires on the black market.

163
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:22,110
I wonder what my father
would have said.

164
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:24,943
I'm afraid the police
meant more than that.

165
00:14:25,016 --> 00:14:27,678
They get rather absurd
ideas sometimes.

166
00:14:27,751 --> 00:14:30,549
He's somewhere now
he won't mind about that.

167
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:35,059
Even so, I'm not going to leave
it at this. Would you help me?

168
00:14:36,995 --> 00:14:41,795
I wish I could. But,
you know, I am an Austrian.

169
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:44,925
I have to be
careful with the police.

170
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:48,029
I'm afraid
I can't help you.

171
00:14:48,106 --> 00:14:51,472
Except with advice,
of course.

172
00:14:51,543 --> 00:14:53,477
Advice.

173
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:57,270
We came out of his place
like this...

174
00:14:57,348 --> 00:14:59,977
and were walking this way.

175
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:03,213
A friend of his called to him
from over there.

176
00:15:03,288 --> 00:15:07,952
Harry went across, and
from up there came the truck.

177
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:11,017
It was just about here.

178
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:16,126
- Here?
- Yes.

179
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,828
His friend and I
picked him up,

180
00:15:18,902 --> 00:15:22,361
carried him across over here.

181
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:27,502
It was a terrible thing. Terrible.

182
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:30,980
We laid him down
just about here.

183
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:35,184
And this is where he died.

184
00:15:35,252 --> 00:15:37,414
Even at the end,
his thoughts were of you.

185
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:39,923
What did he say?

186
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:42,755
I can't remember
the exact words, Holly.

187
00:15:42,827 --> 00:15:46,626
I may call you Holly, mayn't I?
He always called you that to us.

188
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:49,689
He was anxious I should
look after you when you arrived,

189
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:53,430
to see that you got safely home,
tickets, you know, and all that.

190
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:56,439
But he said he died
instantaneously.

191
00:15:59,343 --> 00:16:01,868
Well, he died before
the ambulance could reach us.

192
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:06,746
Well, there was only you and
this friend of his. Uh, who was he?

193
00:16:06,818 --> 00:16:09,150
A Romanian. Mr. Popescu.

194
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,382
- I'd like to talk to him.
- H-He has left Vienna.

195
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:19,958
- Uh, excuse me.
- Yes?

196
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:24,126
- Did you know Mr. Lime well?
- Mr. Lime? Yes.

197
00:16:24,202 --> 00:16:27,035
- You remember me. U-Upstairs.
- Yes, I remember you.

198
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:29,402
Who used to visit Mr. Lime?

199
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:31,567
Visit? Eh...

200
00:16:42,587 --> 00:16:45,852
- What did he say?
- He says he doesn't know everybody.

201
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,565
Excuse me.

202
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,536
Who was at the funeral
besides you?

203
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:03,266
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.

204
00:17:03,341 --> 00:17:05,707
Wasn't there a girl there?

205
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:09,974
Some girl of the Josefstadt Theater.
You know what Harry was.

206
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:13,040
You oughtn't to speak to her.
It would only cause her pain.

207
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:17,213
Not necessarily.
She'd probably want to help.

208
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:20,017
What's the good
of another postmortem?

209
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:23,857
Suppose you dig up something
discreditable to Harry?

210
00:17:23,928 --> 00:17:27,193
- Would you give me your address?
- I live in the Russian sector.

211
00:17:27,264 --> 00:17:29,926
But you'll find me at
the Casanova Club every night.

212
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:32,526
One has to work the best way
one can, you know.

213
00:17:32,604 --> 00:17:35,038
- What's the name of this girl?
- I don't know.

214
00:17:35,106 --> 00:17:37,199
I don't think I ever heard it.

215
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:40,210
You did mention the theater.

216
00:17:40,278 --> 00:17:42,438
Josefstadt.

217
00:17:42,513 --> 00:17:45,972
But I still think
it won't do Harry any good.

218
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:48,883
You'd do better
to think of yourself.

219
00:17:48,953 --> 00:17:51,751
I'll be all right.

220
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:55,452
Of course.
I'm so glad I've met you.

221
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:59,860
A master of suspense!
Such a good cover, I think.

222
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,565
- Number 8, please.
- Mr. Calloway's compliments.

223
00:18:05,636 --> 00:18:08,902
- Here's the ticket for the plane tomorrow.
- Tell the major I won't need it.

224
00:18:08,972 --> 00:18:12,339
Oh, porter, order me a ticket tonight
for the Josefstadt Theater.

225
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:14,570
- Ah, Mr. Martins!
- Good evening, Mr. Crabbin.

226
00:18:14,645 --> 00:18:17,740
He said I was to drive you to the airfield
or the bus, whichever you prefer.

227
00:18:17,816 --> 00:18:21,684
Didn't you hear Mr. Crabbin offer me
the hospitality of the H.Q.B.M.T.?

228
00:19:14,638 --> 00:19:17,767
I was a friend of Harry Lime.

229
00:19:19,577 --> 00:19:23,012
Afterwards.

230
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:45,001
Uh, Miss Schmidt?

231
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:47,401
Oh, come in.

232
00:19:47,472 --> 00:19:49,497
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

233
00:19:49,574 --> 00:19:53,168
- I enjoyed the play very much.
- Danke. Guten Nacht.

234
00:19:53,243 --> 00:19:56,178
- Guten Nacht.
- You were... You were awfully good.

235
00:19:56,247 --> 00:20:00,843
- Do you understand German?
- No, I... Excuse me. I could follow it fine.

236
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:02,130
Oh, yes.

237
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:04,855
Perhaps Harry told you about me.
My name is Holly Martins.

238
00:20:04,923 --> 00:20:07,686
- No, he never told me about his friends.
- Oh.

239
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:09,821
Would you like some tea?
Someone threw me this packet last week.

240
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:10,853
Thank you.

241
00:20:10,928 --> 00:20:14,421
Sometimes the British do instead of
flowers, you know, on the first night.

242
00:20:14,499 --> 00:20:17,524
That was a bouquet from an American.
Would you rather have whiskey?

243
00:20:17,601 --> 00:20:20,934
- Oh, tea's fine.
- Good. I wanted to sell it.

244
00:20:21,004 --> 00:20:25,305
- Oh, there is some tea left.
- Had you known him some time?

245
00:20:27,377 --> 00:20:30,643
- Yes.
- I wanted to talk to you... No, thank you.

246
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:33,012
I wanted to talk to you about him.

247
00:20:33,084 --> 00:20:36,541
There's nothing really to talk about,
is there? Nothing.

248
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,681
Well, I saw you
at the funeral.

249
00:20:39,757 --> 00:20:42,885
I'm so sorry.
I didn't notice much.

250
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:47,591
You were in love with him,
weren't you?

251
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:52,226
I don't know. How can you know
a thing like that afterwards?

252
00:20:52,302 --> 00:20:56,433
I don't know anything anymore,
except I want to be dead too.

253
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:58,667
Some more tea?

254
00:20:58,742 --> 00:21:02,770
No, no tea.
Would you like a cigarette?

255
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,406
Oh, American.
Thank you. I like them.

256
00:21:05,482 --> 00:21:09,851
I was talking to another friend
of Harry's, a Baron Kurtz.

257
00:21:09,921 --> 00:21:11,980
- Do you know him?
- No.

258
00:21:12,056 --> 00:21:15,252
- He's got a little dog.
- Oh, yes, yes.

259
00:21:15,326 --> 00:21:18,021
Don't understand what Harry saw
in a fellow like that.

260
00:21:18,096 --> 00:21:21,292
That was the man who brought me
some money when Harry died.

261
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:24,129
He said Harry had been
anxious at the last moment.

262
00:21:24,202 --> 00:21:27,136
Hmm. He said
he remembered me too.

263
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:30,231
Seems to show
he wasn't in much pain.

264
00:21:30,308 --> 00:21:32,571
Dr. Winkel told me that.

265
00:21:32,644 --> 00:21:35,306
Dr. Winkel?
Who's he?

266
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:40,078
A doctor Harry used to go to.
He was passing just after it happened.

267
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:42,517
- His own doctor?
- Yes.

268
00:21:42,587 --> 00:21:45,953
Well, were you
at the inquest?

269
00:21:46,023 --> 00:21:48,959
Yes. They said it wasn't
the driver's fault.

270
00:21:49,027 --> 00:21:51,962
Harry had often said what
a careful driver he was.

271
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,964
- He was Harry's driver?
- Mm-hmm.

272
00:21:55,032 --> 00:21:59,367
Well, uh,
I don't get it.

273
00:21:59,436 --> 00:22:03,964
All of them there!
Uh, Kurtz, this Romanian, uh, Popescu,

274
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,306
his own driver
knocking him over,

275
00:22:06,376 --> 00:22:08,902
his own doctor
just passing by.

276
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,447
No strangers there at all.

277
00:22:11,515 --> 00:22:14,109
I know. I've wondered
about it a hundred times,

278
00:22:14,184 --> 00:22:16,675
if it really was an accident.

279
00:22:21,392 --> 00:22:23,758
What difference does it make?
He's dead, isn't he?

280
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:25,818
- But if it wasn't an...
- Frau Schmidt!

281
00:22:29,367 --> 00:22:32,336
I must hurry. They don't like
us to use the lights.

282
00:22:32,403 --> 00:22:35,770
- The porter saw it happen.
- Then why worry?

283
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:41,339
Look, do you know
that porter?

284
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:44,680
Yes.

285
00:22:50,754 --> 00:22:53,348
- What's he saying?
- He says it happened right down there.

286
00:22:53,424 --> 00:22:56,187
Happened, yes.
Happened right down there.

287
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,354
- You saw it?
- Well, not saw, heard.

288
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,729
Heard. I heard the brakes.

289
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,291
And I got to the window and saw them
carry the body to the other side...

290
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:10,306
uh, Josef, the Josef...

291
00:23:10,374 --> 00:23:12,865
Emperor Josef statue.

292
00:23:12,943 --> 00:23:15,878
Why didn't they
bring him in the house?

293
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:42,600
- Could he have been conscious?
- Conscious?

294
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:47,076
Uh, was he... was he still alive?

295
00:23:47,145 --> 00:23:50,341
Ah, alive!
He couldn't have been alive,

296
00:23:50,414 --> 00:23:53,747
not with his head
in the way it was.

297
00:23:53,818 --> 00:23:56,343
I was told that
he did not die at once.

298
00:23:58,489 --> 00:24:00,423
No, I mean that...

299
00:24:02,492 --> 00:24:04,654
No, you...

300
00:24:08,732 --> 00:24:12,031
- He was quite dead.
- He was... He was quite dead.

301
00:24:12,103 --> 00:24:14,537
He was quite dead.

302
00:24:14,605 --> 00:24:17,039
But this sounds crazy.

303
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:20,942
If he was killed at once, how could he have
talked about me and this lady here?

304
00:24:21,011 --> 00:24:23,878
Why didn't you say all this
at the inquest?

305
00:24:23,947 --> 00:24:27,974
Uh, it's better not to be
mixed up in things like this.

306
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,452
Things like what?

307
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,820
I was not the only one
who did not give evidence.

308
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:36,325
Who else?

309
00:24:36,394 --> 00:24:39,693
Three men helped to carry
your friend to the statue.

310
00:24:39,763 --> 00:24:41,288
- Kurtz?
- Yes.

311
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:43,230
- The Romanian?
- Yes.

312
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,531
- And?
- There was a third man. He didn't give evidence.

313
00:24:46,604 --> 00:24:48,538
- You mean the doctor?
- No, no, no.

314
00:24:48,606 --> 00:24:51,870
He came later, after they
carried him to the Josef statue.

315
00:24:51,943 --> 00:24:54,468
What did this man look like?

316
00:24:54,545 --> 00:24:56,672
I didn't see his face.

317
00:24:59,716 --> 00:25:05,383
He didn't look up.
He was quite, uh, ordinary.

318
00:25:05,455 --> 00:25:09,755
He... He might have been...

319
00:25:09,827 --> 00:25:11,761
just anybody.

320
00:25:13,563 --> 00:25:15,498
Just anybody.

321
00:25:18,368 --> 00:25:21,166
Hello? Hello.

322
00:25:23,441 --> 00:25:25,375
Hello.

323
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:32,005
Hello?

324
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:37,518
- Who was that?
- I don't know. They didn't answer.

325
00:25:37,588 --> 00:25:40,078
But I was told
there were only two men there.

326
00:25:40,156 --> 00:25:42,522
You've got to tell
your story to the police.

327
00:25:42,593 --> 00:25:46,050
The police? Why police?

328
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:49,327
It's nonsense! It is all nonsense!
It was an accident

329
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:51,629
You don't know
it was an accident.

330
00:25:51,702 --> 00:25:53,658
You only saw a dead man
with three men carrying him.

331
00:25:54,704 --> 00:25:57,037
I should have listened
to my wife.

332
00:25:57,107 --> 00:25:59,702
She said you were
up to no good. Gossip.

333
00:25:59,777 --> 00:26:01,711
Suppose I take
your evidence to the police?

334
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:06,276
Now, hold on.

335
00:26:11,622 --> 00:26:14,886
I have no evidence.
I- I saw nothing, I said nothing.

336
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:17,154
- It's not my business.
- We'll make it your business.

337
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:22,965
Hold on.

338
00:26:26,636 --> 00:26:30,504
I have always liked you, but you
must not bring this gentleman again.

339
00:26:30,574 --> 00:26:33,338
You must go at once,
please. Please!

340
00:26:33,411 --> 00:26:36,847
Please!

341
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:46,088
You shouldn't get
mixed up in this.

342
00:26:46,156 --> 00:26:50,287
Well, if I do find out something,
can I look you up again?

343
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,693
Why don't you leave
this town? Go home.

344
00:27:02,606 --> 00:27:05,200
What is it?

345
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:16,213
- What's she talking about?
- The police are searching my room.

346
00:27:46,783 --> 00:27:49,752
- What the devil?
- Getting around, Martins?

347
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:52,482
Oh, pinning things
on giris now.

348
00:27:52,556 --> 00:27:55,684
Miss Schmidt, I should like
to see your papers, please.

349
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,558
Don't you give him anything.

350
00:27:58,628 --> 00:28:00,562
Thank you.

351
00:28:02,465 --> 00:28:05,526
You were born in Graz
of Austrian parents?

352
00:28:05,603 --> 00:28:07,627
Yes.

353
00:28:07,704 --> 00:28:09,638
Paine.

354
00:28:17,882 --> 00:28:19,816
Hmm.

355
00:28:25,255 --> 00:28:28,418
It's very good, sir,
isn't it, eh?

356
00:28:28,492 --> 00:28:30,686
How much did you pay
for this?

357
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:34,957
I'm afraid I shall have to keep
this for a while, Miss Schmidt.

358
00:28:35,031 --> 00:28:37,185
How do you expect her to live
without her papers?

359
00:28:37,186 --> 00:28:38,262
Write her out a receipt.

360
00:28:38,335 --> 00:28:41,566
- Give her a receipt for those letters too.
- This way, miss.

361
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:44,699
I suppose it wouldn't interest you
to know that Harry Lime was murdered.

362
00:28:44,774 --> 00:28:48,369
You're too busy. You haven't even
bothered to get the complete evidence.

363
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:58,810
- Must you take those?
- They'll be returned, miss.

364
00:28:58,888 --> 00:29:01,653
They are private letters.

365
00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:03,818
That's all right, miss.
Don't worry.

366
00:29:03,894 --> 00:29:06,828
We're used to it.
Like doctors.

367
00:29:06,896 --> 00:29:10,832
There was a third man there. I suppose
that doesn't sound peculiar to you.

368
00:29:10,901 --> 00:29:15,530
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like
Lime was killed by his friends or by accident.

369
00:29:15,606 --> 00:29:17,630
The only important thing
is that he's dead.

370
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:22,640
- I'm sorry.
- Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?

371
00:29:22,713 --> 00:29:24,907
- Calloway.
- Must you take those letters?

372
00:29:24,982 --> 00:29:27,472
- Yes, I'm afraid so.
- They're Harry's.

373
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:31,543
- That's the reason.
- You won't learn anything from them.

374
00:29:31,622 --> 00:29:35,422
They're only... love letters.
There are not many of them.

375
00:29:35,492 --> 00:29:38,928
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt,
as soon as they've been examined.

376
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:42,932
There's nothing in them.
Harry never did anything.

377
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,763
Only a small thing once,
out of kindness.

378
00:29:45,836 --> 00:29:50,033
- And what was that?
- You've got it in your hand.

379
00:29:50,107 --> 00:29:52,540
Major Calloway?

380
00:29:52,609 --> 00:29:55,545
- Finished?
- Yes. Okay.

381
00:29:55,613 --> 00:29:59,105
You will have to come
with us, Miss Schmidt.

382
00:29:59,183 --> 00:30:03,017
- You're not locking her up.
- Go home, Martins, like a sensible chap.

383
00:30:03,087 --> 00:30:06,113
- Get the next plane.
- As soon as I get to the bottom of this.

384
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:09,250
Death's at the bottom
of everything, Martins.

385
00:30:09,326 --> 00:30:13,558
Mind if I use that line in my
next western? You can't chuck me out.

386
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,054
Here we are, miss.
Your receipt for the letters.

387
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:17,567
I don't want it.

388
00:30:17,635 --> 00:30:20,569
Well, I've got it
when you want it, miss.

389
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,109
Anything really wrong
with your papers?

390
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,374
They're forged.

391
00:30:32,449 --> 00:30:34,848
Oh.

392
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:36,943
Why?

393
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,649
The Russians would claim me.
I come from Czechoslovakia.

394
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,400
What'd she say?

395
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:08,040
Only complaining about the way
they behaved in her house.

396
00:31:12,088 --> 00:31:15,422
Give her some cigarettes.

397
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:19,895
- Uh, cigarettes, hmm?
- Danke.

398
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:22,364
No, go ahead, take the...

399
00:31:24,434 --> 00:31:27,369
Miss Schmidt, ready?

400
00:31:27,437 --> 00:31:29,838
Now, look,

401
00:31:29,906 --> 00:31:34,502
I'll straighten out
all this nonsense about Harry.

402
00:31:35,913 --> 00:31:37,847
You'll be all right.

403
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:42,778
Sometimes he said
I laughed too much.

404
00:31:45,923 --> 00:31:48,857
Oh, what's the name of that doctor?
Harry's doctor?

405
00:31:48,925 --> 00:31:52,885
- Dr. Winkel.
- What do you want to see a doctor for?

406
00:31:52,963 --> 00:31:55,761
- A bruised lip.
- Good.

407
00:32:09,913 --> 00:32:13,280
Laboratory, we're coming right down.

408
00:32:19,822 --> 00:32:21,950
You wait here, Miss Schmidt.

409
00:32:55,326 --> 00:32:58,193
Is Dr. Winkel in?

410
00:32:58,261 --> 00:33:01,253
- Dr. Winkel. I'm sorry. I don't speak German.
- Nein.

411
00:33:01,331 --> 00:33:05,665
Please, won't you say that
I'm a friend of Harry Lime?

412
00:33:08,905 --> 00:33:10,964
- Bitte.
- Thank you.

413
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:15,606
Bittesehr.

414
00:33:24,954 --> 00:33:27,445
Guten Nacht.

415
00:33:27,523 --> 00:33:30,686
- Dr. Winkel?
- Vinkel.

416
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:32,922
Uh, Dr. Vinkel.

417
00:33:32,995 --> 00:33:36,557
Quite a collection
of, uh... collection.

418
00:33:36,633 --> 00:33:38,931
Yes.

419
00:33:49,913 --> 00:33:52,244
Is that your dog?

420
00:33:52,316 --> 00:33:54,340
Yes. Would you mind, Mr., uh...

421
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:56,647
- Martins.
- Martins, coming to the point, please?

422
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,847
- Thank you.
- I have guests waiting.

423
00:33:58,922 --> 00:34:02,517
- We were both friends of Harry Lime.
- I was his medical advisor.

424
00:34:02,593 --> 00:34:05,618
- I want to find out all I can.
- Find out?

425
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:08,687
- Yeah, the details.
- I can tell you very little.

426
00:34:08,765 --> 00:34:12,861
He was run over by a car.
He was dead when I arrived.

427
00:34:12,935 --> 00:34:16,735
- Who was with him?
- Two friends of his.

428
00:34:16,807 --> 00:34:19,434
You sure? Two?

429
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:22,444
Quite sure.

430
00:34:22,512 --> 00:34:24,777
Could he have been
at all conscious?

431
00:34:24,847 --> 00:34:28,750
I understand he was, yes,
for a short time...

432
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:31,252
while they carried him
across the road.

433
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:34,312
- In great pain?
- Mmm, not necessarily.

434
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:37,519
Could he have been capable
of making plans...

435
00:34:37,593 --> 00:34:42,053
for me and others just,
just during those few moments?

436
00:34:42,131 --> 00:34:45,066
I understand he left some
instructions before he died.

437
00:34:45,135 --> 00:34:48,399
I cannot give an opinion.
I was not there.

438
00:34:48,472 --> 00:34:52,841
My opinion is limited
to the causes of death.

439
00:34:55,111 --> 00:34:57,602
Have you any reason
to be dissatisfied?

440
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,615
Was it possible
that his death...

441
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:03,778
might have been
not accidental?

442
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:07,819
Could he have been...

443
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:12,020
Could he have been...
pushed, Dr. Winkel?

444
00:35:14,263 --> 00:35:19,200
Vinkel.
I cannot give an opinion.

445
00:35:19,269 --> 00:35:23,705
The injuries to the head and skull
would have been the same.

446
00:35:30,613 --> 00:35:33,548
Major, may I see you
for a moment, please?

447
00:35:33,617 --> 00:35:35,778
Certainly, Brodsky.
What is it?

448
00:35:35,852 --> 00:35:40,482
This forgery is very clever,
and we are interested in this case.

449
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:42,548
- Have you arrested the girl?
- No, not yet.

450
00:35:42,626 --> 00:35:46,584
Please, keep this passport to yourself
until I will make some inquiries.

451
00:35:46,662 --> 00:35:49,495
- Will you, Major? Thank you.
- Yes, of course.

452
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:51,624
Right, sit down,
Miss Schmidt.

453
00:35:51,702 --> 00:35:54,102
We'll send your letters
and things back to you.

454
00:35:54,171 --> 00:35:57,265
- And my passport?
- We'll need that for a while.

455
00:36:02,312 --> 00:36:04,803
What did he mean?

456
00:36:04,881 --> 00:36:07,316
You know as much as I do.

457
00:36:07,383 --> 00:36:12,651
Miss Schmidt, you were intimate
with Lime, weren't you?

458
00:36:12,723 --> 00:36:15,486
We loved each other.
Do you mean that?

459
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:18,026
- Do you know this man?
- I've never seen him.

460
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:20,461
- Joseph Harbin.
- No.

461
00:36:20,531 --> 00:36:24,466
- He works in a military hospital.
- No.

462
00:36:24,535 --> 00:36:28,903
It's stupid to lie to me, Miss Schmidt.
I'm in a position to help you.

463
00:36:28,972 --> 00:36:31,133
I'm not lying.

464
00:36:31,207 --> 00:36:33,870
You're wrong about Harry.
You're wrong about everything.

465
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:38,573
In one of his letters, he asked you to telephone
a good friend of his called Joseph.

466
00:36:38,649 --> 00:36:41,584
He gave you the number
of the Casanova Club.

467
00:36:41,651 --> 00:36:45,644
That's where a lot of friends
of Lime used to go.

468
00:36:45,722 --> 00:36:49,452
- It wasn't important.
- What was the message?

469
00:36:49,526 --> 00:36:52,187
Something about
meeting Harry at his home.

470
00:36:52,261 --> 00:36:55,698
Harbin disappeared
the day you telephoned.

471
00:36:55,765 --> 00:36:58,894
We've got to find him.
You can help us.

472
00:37:00,736 --> 00:37:04,138
What can I tell you, but you've
got everything upside down.

473
00:37:04,207 --> 00:37:09,473
Okay. That American friend
of yours is still waiting for you.

474
00:37:09,546 --> 00:37:13,037
He won't do you much good.

475
00:37:15,718 --> 00:37:18,653
I thank you, Miss Schmidt.
We'll send for you when we want you.

476
00:37:26,463 --> 00:37:29,899
Hello, Mr. Martins. I've been
trying to get you at your hotel.

477
00:37:29,966 --> 00:37:32,231
I've arranged that lecture
for tomorrow.

478
00:37:32,301 --> 00:37:33,321
Well, what about?

479
00:37:33,322 --> 00:37:35,361
On the modern novel.
You remember what we arranged.

480
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:38,408
- Oh.
- They want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.

481
00:37:38,475 --> 00:37:41,569
- What's that?
- Oh, I thought you'd know. You're a writer.

482
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:44,580
But of course you do. Good night,
old man. I've forgotten my hat.

483
00:37:44,647 --> 00:37:47,082
- I'll let you know the time later.
- Mmm.

484
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:57,386
- Drink?
- Whiskey.

485
00:37:57,461 --> 00:37:59,519
Two whiskeys.

486
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:06,327
- Zwei Whisky.
- How much?

487
00:38:06,403 --> 00:38:09,133
- Twenty shillings.
- Oh, they don't take army money here.

488
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:11,140
How much did he say?

489
00:38:13,075 --> 00:38:16,102
- Harry?
- Yes.

490
00:38:16,178 --> 00:38:19,238
He moved his head,
but the rest is good, isn't it?

491
00:38:35,265 --> 00:38:37,825
- Good evening, Miss Schmidt.
- Good evening.

492
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:40,334
You've found out
my little secret.

493
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:43,895
A man must live.
How goes the investigation?

494
00:38:43,973 --> 00:38:46,135
Have you proved
the policemen are wrong?

495
00:38:46,209 --> 00:38:48,676
- Not yet.
- But you will.

496
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:52,305
Our friend Dr. Winkel said
you had called. Wasn't he helpful?

497
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:54,372
Well, he was limited.

498
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:57,385
- But Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
- The Romanian?

499
00:38:57,453 --> 00:38:59,718
- Yes, the man who helped carry him.
- I thought he'd left Vienna.

500
00:38:59,789 --> 00:39:01,883
He's back now.

501
00:39:01,957 --> 00:39:05,189
Well, I'd like to meet
all of Harry's friends.

502
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:07,388
I'll bring him to you.

503
00:39:07,464 --> 00:39:10,432
Haven't you done
enough for tonight?

504
00:39:10,499 --> 00:39:15,164
The porter said three men carried
the body, and two of them are here.

505
00:39:19,508 --> 00:39:21,908
Who are you
lookin' for now?

506
00:39:21,977 --> 00:39:25,674
Shh. Shh.
Don't. Please don't.

507
00:39:25,749 --> 00:39:27,716
Silly lookin' bunch.

508
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:32,684
- Mr. Popescu, Mr. Martins.
- How do you do?

509
00:39:32,756 --> 00:39:35,781
- Any friend of Harry is a friend of mine.
- I'll leave you together.

510
00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:39,555
- Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
- Of course.

511
00:39:39,629 --> 00:39:42,689
- I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins.
- Oh, you did?

512
00:39:42,765 --> 00:39:45,530
Not a sort of thing
I should confess to a stranger,

513
00:39:45,602 --> 00:39:47,934
but you have to break
the rules sometimes.

514
00:39:48,004 --> 00:39:51,963
Humanity is a duty. Cigarette,
Miss Schmidt? Keep the pack.

515
00:39:52,042 --> 00:39:54,533
I understand
you were with Harry...

516
00:39:54,611 --> 00:39:57,444
Two double whiskeys.

517
00:40:00,383 --> 00:40:04,819
It was a terrible thing. I was just
crossing the road to go to Harry.

518
00:40:04,888 --> 00:40:08,153
He and the baron
were on the sidewalk.

519
00:40:08,225 --> 00:40:11,955
Maybe if I hadn't started to cross
the road, it wouldn't have happened.

520
00:40:12,028 --> 00:40:16,124
I can't help blaming myself
and wishing things had been different.

521
00:40:16,198 --> 00:40:21,397
Anyway, he saw me and stepped
off the sidewalk to meet me.

522
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,769
And the truck...

523
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:28,140
It was terrible, Mr. Martins. Terrible.
I've never seen a man killed before.

524
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:31,180
I think there was something
funny about the whole thing.

525
00:40:31,247 --> 00:40:33,477
- Funny?
- Something wrong.

526
00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:36,814
Of course there was.
Some ice for Mr. Martins.

527
00:40:36,886 --> 00:40:39,685
- You think so too?
- It was so terribly stupid...

528
00:40:39,756 --> 00:40:43,214
for a man like Harry to be killed
in an ordinary street accident.

529
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:45,488
- That's all you meant?
- What else?

530
00:40:45,562 --> 00:40:48,325
Who was the third man?

531
00:40:48,397 --> 00:40:51,231
I oughtn't to drink it.

532
00:40:51,301 --> 00:40:53,428
It makes me acid.

533
00:40:53,502 --> 00:40:56,267
What man would you be
referring to, Mr. Martins?

534
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:59,274
I was told that a third man
helped you and Kurtz carry the body.

535
00:40:59,341 --> 00:41:02,778
I don't know how you got that idea.
You'll find all about it in the police report.

536
00:41:02,845 --> 00:41:05,678
There was just the two of us,
me and the baron.

537
00:41:05,749 --> 00:41:08,149
Who could have told you
a story like that?

538
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:11,312
The porter at Harry's place.
He was cleaning the window at the time.

539
00:41:11,388 --> 00:41:13,321
And saw the accident?

540
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:17,292
No, he didn't see the accident,
but he saw three men carrying the body.

541
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,124
Why wasn't he
at the police inquiry?

542
00:41:20,196 --> 00:41:22,187
He doesn't want
to get involved.

543
00:41:22,265 --> 00:41:25,131
You'll never teach these
Austrians to be good citizens.

544
00:41:25,202 --> 00:41:27,727
It was his duty
to give the evidence.

545
00:41:27,803 --> 00:41:29,738
Even so, he remembers wrong.

546
00:41:29,805 --> 00:41:32,104
What else did he tell you?

547
00:41:32,174 --> 00:41:35,769
That Harry was dead before
you got him to that statue.

548
00:41:35,845 --> 00:41:38,609
He probably knows
a lot more than that.

549
00:41:38,682 --> 00:41:41,242
- Somebody's lying.
- Hmm, not necessarily.

550
00:41:41,318 --> 00:41:44,343
The police say he was
mixed up in some racket?

551
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:48,220
Oh, that's quite impossible.
He had a great sense of duty.

552
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,885
Your friend Kurtz seems
to think it was possible.

553
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:55,227
I understand how an Anglo-Saxon feels.
The baron hasn't traveled, you know?

554
00:41:55,298 --> 00:41:58,028
He seems to have
been around a bit.

555
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,093
Do you know a man
called, uh, Harbin?

556
00:42:01,171 --> 00:42:04,037
- No.
- Joseph Harbin.

557
00:42:04,106 --> 00:42:06,336
Joseph Harbin? No.

558
00:42:09,144 --> 00:42:13,843
That's a nice girl, that,
but she ought to go careful in Vienna.

559
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:17,751
Everybody ought to go careful
in a city like this.

560
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:24,289
He will meet us
at the bridge. Good.

561
00:43:01,397 --> 00:43:05,129
Hello! Is it
so very important for you?

562
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,725
- Yes, it is.
- I am not a bad man.

563
00:43:07,803 --> 00:43:10,102
I'd like to tell you something.

564
00:43:10,173 --> 00:43:12,106
Tell me, how did the car...

565
00:43:12,174 --> 00:43:16,305
Shh, shh. Come tonight.
My wife goes out.

566
00:43:16,379 --> 00:43:19,780
- All right, I'll come back, but...
- Shh. Tonight.

567
00:43:35,731 --> 00:43:37,723
Does that mean come in?

568
00:43:37,801 --> 00:43:39,769
Oh, yes, come in.

569
00:43:39,836 --> 00:43:41,928
The porter's going
to talk to us tonight.

570
00:43:42,004 --> 00:43:44,098
Need we go through it
all again?

571
00:43:44,173 --> 00:43:46,573
I can manage by myself.
You busy?

572
00:43:46,642 --> 00:43:49,111
Just another part
I've got to learn.

573
00:43:49,178 --> 00:43:51,339
Can I hear you?

574
00:43:51,414 --> 00:43:53,473
- In German?
- I can try.

575
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:57,178
- Is it comedy or tragedy?
- Comedy. I don't play tragedy.

576
00:43:57,252 --> 00:43:59,687
- Do I, uh, read...
- Well, you read this.

577
00:43:59,756 --> 00:44:02,781
Oh. Well, I...

578
00:44:05,995 --> 00:44:09,363
- What's that?
- Uh, Heurigen, I guess.

579
00:44:09,432 --> 00:44:11,696
H- E-Z-T...

580
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:14,292
Oh, let me see.
No, no, that's not the cue.

581
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:17,305
It means
she has to sit down.

582
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:24,444
Well, uh, Frau Hausman...

583
00:44:25,615 --> 00:44:29,243
No, no.
It's no good.

584
00:44:31,955 --> 00:44:33,888
Bad day?

585
00:44:33,957 --> 00:44:36,892
It's always bad around this time.

586
00:44:36,959 --> 00:44:39,894
He used to look in around 6:00.

587
00:44:41,698 --> 00:44:45,758
I've been frightened. I've been alone
without friends and money.

588
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:49,133
But I've never known
anything like this.

589
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:54,240
Please talk.
Tell me about him.

590
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:56,243
Tell you what?

591
00:44:56,312 --> 00:45:00,908
Oh, anything. Just talk. Where did you
see him last, and what did you do?

592
00:45:00,984 --> 00:45:04,044
Oh, we didn't make much sense.
We drank too much.

593
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,055
- Once he tried to steal my girl.
- Where is she?

594
00:45:09,292 --> 00:45:12,522
- Oh, that was nine years ago.
- Tell me more.

595
00:45:12,595 --> 00:45:16,531
Well, it's very difficult. You knew Harry.

596
00:45:16,598 --> 00:45:19,260
We didn't do anything
very amusing.

597
00:45:19,334 --> 00:45:22,303
He just made everything
seem like such fun.

598
00:45:22,372 --> 00:45:26,274
- Was he clever when he was a boy?
- He could fix anything.

599
00:45:26,341 --> 00:45:29,209
- What sort of things?
- Oh, little things.

600
00:45:29,278 --> 00:45:33,443
How to put your temperature up
before exam. The best crib.

601
00:45:33,515 --> 00:45:36,040
How to avoid this and that.

602
00:45:36,118 --> 00:45:38,713
He fixed my papers for me.

603
00:45:38,787 --> 00:45:43,555
He heard the Russians were repatriating
people like me who came from Czechoslovakia.

604
00:45:43,626 --> 00:45:46,754
He knew the right person
straightaway for forging stamps.

605
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,388
Yeah.

606
00:45:48,464 --> 00:45:51,524
When he was 14, he taught me
the three-card trick.

607
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,696
- That's growing up fast.
- He never grew up.

608
00:45:55,772 --> 00:45:58,899
The worid grew up
around him, that's all.

609
00:46:00,542 --> 00:46:03,068
And buried him.

610
00:46:03,145 --> 00:46:06,410
Anna, you'll
fall in love again.

611
00:46:06,482 --> 00:46:09,316
Don't you see
I don't want to?

612
00:46:09,385 --> 00:46:11,319
I don't ever want to.

613
00:46:11,386 --> 00:46:13,946
Come on out and have a drink.

614
00:46:14,022 --> 00:46:16,513
Why did you say that?

615
00:46:16,593 --> 00:46:19,060
Seemed like a good idea.

616
00:46:19,129 --> 00:46:21,859
It was just what he used to say.

617
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:25,923
Well, uh, I didn't
learn that from him.

618
00:46:26,002 --> 00:46:28,595
If we have to see the porter,
we'd better go.

619
00:46:28,671 --> 00:46:31,465
What's the hurry? Can't we talk
quietly for a couple of minutes?

620
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:32,729
I thought you wanted...

621
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:35,106
A moment ago, you said you
didn't want to see the porter.

622
00:46:35,178 --> 00:46:38,705
- We're both in it, Harry.
- Holly.

623
00:46:38,781 --> 00:46:41,044
I'm so sorry.

624
00:46:41,117 --> 00:46:44,950
It's all right.
You might get my name right.

625
00:46:47,957 --> 00:46:51,790
You know, you ought
to find yourself a girl.

626
00:46:51,861 --> 00:46:54,886
His English is so very bad,
we'll let him talk German.

627
00:46:54,964 --> 00:46:58,490
- If you'll be good enough to trans...
- Look.

628
00:46:58,568 --> 00:47:02,298
- That's Harry's place, isn't it?
- Yes.

629
00:47:02,372 --> 00:47:05,307
- Let's go away.
- What's the matter?

630
00:47:05,374 --> 00:47:09,640
- Let's not get into any more trouble.
- Wait here.

631
00:47:14,049 --> 00:47:17,109
What's the matter?
Uh, what is, los?

632
00:47:17,187 --> 00:47:20,486
I- I don't understand.

633
00:47:20,557 --> 00:47:23,390
Um, porter, uh, dead.

634
00:47:23,459 --> 00:47:25,392
Kaputt.

635
00:47:25,461 --> 00:47:28,725
The porter is odraht. Kaputt.

636
00:47:28,798 --> 00:47:30,731
- Porter?
- He's murdered.

637
00:47:30,799 --> 00:47:32,734
Papa!

638
00:47:42,444 --> 00:47:44,743
Ja, Papa!

639
00:47:55,725 --> 00:47:58,124
I, uh, don't understand.

640
00:48:08,203 --> 00:48:11,604
- What is it?
- The porter's been murdered.

641
00:48:17,546 --> 00:48:19,981
They think you did it.

642
00:48:35,131 --> 00:48:38,897
Hello?

643
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:49,106
Papa!

644
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:31,804
Sneak out the other way and go back to
your theater. I'd better not see you again.

645
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,440
- What are you going to do?
- I wish I knew.

646
00:49:34,516 --> 00:49:36,813
Be sensible.
Tell Major Calloway.

647
00:49:58,072 --> 00:50:00,836
- Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
- Oh, Mr. Martins.

648
00:50:00,909 --> 00:50:03,441
It's very urgent.
Just get him on the telephone.

649
00:50:03,442 --> 00:50:04,708
Do you know his number?

650
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:08,215
- No, I don't know his number.
- I'll look it up for you.

651
00:50:08,282 --> 00:50:11,251
- Is there a car here?
- Of course. There's one waiting for you.

652
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,550
Never mind about the number.

653
00:50:22,264 --> 00:50:24,561
Take me to the headquarters...

654
00:50:28,137 --> 00:50:31,470
Hold on! I haven't even
told you where to take me yet!

655
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:38,740
Driver! Driver!

656
00:50:38,813 --> 00:50:42,773
Slow down!

657
00:50:42,851 --> 00:50:45,751
Have you got orders to kill me?

658
00:51:18,052 --> 00:51:22,079
Ah, ah, ah! Ah, Mr. Martins!
What a relief to see you.

659
00:51:22,157 --> 00:51:24,954
I was beginning to think
something had happened to you.

660
00:51:25,027 --> 00:51:28,621
Everything's ready for you.
I was frantic in case you hadn't got...

661
00:51:28,697 --> 00:51:31,097
my message at the hotel.

662
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:33,896
Porters out here
are so unreliable.

663
00:51:33,969 --> 00:51:35,936
We're all set
for a wonderful meeting.

664
00:51:36,003 --> 00:51:38,302
You'll find the audience
most appreciative.

665
00:51:38,373 --> 00:51:40,773
Oh, let me take your coat.
I've got it.

666
00:51:40,842 --> 00:51:44,039
There'll be refreshments afterwards.
Come along. Follow me.

667
00:51:44,112 --> 00:51:46,603
Well, here we are,
ladies and gentlemen.

668
00:51:46,682 --> 00:51:48,842
Would you look after those?
Thank you.

669
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:51,784
Would you like to sit there?
That's right.

670
00:51:51,853 --> 00:51:55,880
I have much pleasure in introducing
Mr. Holly Martins from the other side.

671
00:52:00,929 --> 00:52:03,829
Well...

672
00:52:03,898 --> 00:52:07,231
Bring the car and anyone
else who would like to come.

673
00:52:07,302 --> 00:52:10,327
Don't be long. Hmm.

674
00:52:13,941 --> 00:52:17,469
Yeah, well, I... I suppose
that is what I meant to say.

675
00:52:17,545 --> 00:52:19,479
Of course, of course.

676
00:52:19,548 --> 00:52:24,315
Do you believe, Mr. Martins,
in the stream of consciousness?

677
00:52:24,385 --> 00:52:28,652
Stream of consciousness?
Well, uh... Well, uh...

678
00:52:28,724 --> 00:52:32,353
- Well, uh...
- What author has chiefly influenced you?

679
00:52:32,427 --> 00:52:35,293
- Grey.
- Grey? What Grey?

680
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:38,856
- Zane Grey.
- That's Mr. Martins' little joke, of course.

681
00:52:38,934 --> 00:52:42,233
We know perfectly well Zane Grey
wrote what we call westerns.

682
00:52:42,304 --> 00:52:44,295
Cowboys and bandits.

683
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:48,434
Mr. James Joyce...
Now, where would you put him?

684
00:52:50,244 --> 00:52:52,769
Oh, uh, would you mind
repeating that question?

685
00:52:52,847 --> 00:52:56,045
I said, where would you put
Mr. James Joyce?

686
00:52:56,117 --> 00:52:58,882
In what category?

687
00:52:58,954 --> 00:53:02,617
Can I ask, is Mr. Martins
engaged on a new book?

688
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:06,559
Yes. It's called The Third Man.

689
00:53:06,628 --> 00:53:09,722
- A novel, Mr. Martins?
- It's a murder story.

690
00:53:09,798 --> 00:53:13,097
I've just started it.
It's based on fact.

691
00:53:13,168 --> 00:53:17,195
Why, it's Mr. Popescu!
Oh, very great pleasure to see you here.

692
00:53:17,271 --> 00:53:21,902
As you know, Mr. Popescu is a very great
supporter of one of our medical charities.

693
00:53:21,976 --> 00:53:24,945
Are you a slow writer,
Mr. Martins?

694
00:53:25,012 --> 00:53:27,572
Not when I get interested.

695
00:53:27,648 --> 00:53:30,641
I'd say you were doing something
pretty dangerous this time.

696
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:33,949
- Yeah?
- Mixing fact and fiction.

697
00:53:34,021 --> 00:53:37,650
- Should I make it all fact?
- Why, no, Mr. Martins.

698
00:53:37,726 --> 00:53:40,159
I'd say stick to fiction.
Straight fiction.

699
00:53:40,228 --> 00:53:43,128
I'm too far along
with the book, Mr. Popescu.

700
00:53:43,197 --> 00:53:46,291
- Haven't you ever scrapped a book, Mr. Martins?
- Never.

701
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,130
Pity.

702
00:53:50,204 --> 00:53:52,729
Ladies and gentlemen,
if there are no more questions,

703
00:53:52,807 --> 00:53:55,333
I think I can call the meeting
officially closed.

704
00:54:13,561 --> 00:54:15,086
That's him.

705
00:54:35,383 --> 00:54:38,648
Who's there?
Who is it? Who is it?

706
00:54:41,088 --> 00:54:43,956
It's all right.
It's all right.

707
00:55:47,421 --> 00:55:49,787
I told you
to go away, Martins.

708
00:55:49,858 --> 00:55:53,418
This isn't Santa Fe, I'm not a sheriff
and you aren't a cowboy.

709
00:55:53,494 --> 00:55:56,463
You've been blundering around with
the worst bunch of racketeers in Vienna,

710
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:59,124
Harry's friends,
and now you're wanted for murder.

711
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,691
- Put down drunk and disorderly too.
- I have.

712
00:56:01,769 --> 00:56:04,829
- What's the matter with your hand?
- Parrot bit me.

713
00:56:04,905 --> 00:56:07,170
Oh, stop behaving
like a fool, Martins.

714
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:10,677
I'm only a little fool. I'm an amateur
at it. You're a professional.

715
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:13,510
You've been shaking your
cap and bells all over town.

716
00:56:13,581 --> 00:56:16,516
Get me the Harry Lime file,
and get Mr. Martins a whiskey.

717
00:56:16,585 --> 00:56:19,052
I don't need
your drinks, Calloway.

718
00:56:19,121 --> 00:56:22,351
You will. I don't want
another murder in this case,

719
00:56:22,423 --> 00:56:24,653
so you're going to hear
the facts.

720
00:56:24,726 --> 00:56:27,626
You haven't told me
a single one yet.

721
00:56:27,695 --> 00:56:30,289
Have you ever heard
of penicillin?

722
00:56:30,365 --> 00:56:32,161
Well?

723
00:56:32,233 --> 00:56:34,998
In Vienna, there hasn't been
enough penicillin to go around.

724
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:37,231
So a nice trade started here:

725
00:56:37,304 --> 00:56:40,398
Stealing penicillin
from the military hospitals,

726
00:56:40,474 --> 00:56:44,240
diluting it to make it go further,
and selling it to patients.

727
00:56:44,311 --> 00:56:46,246
Do you see what that means?

728
00:56:46,313 --> 00:56:49,476
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes
of penicillin to investigate a murder?

729
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:51,882
These were murders.

730
00:56:51,952 --> 00:56:54,114
Men with gangrened legs,

731
00:56:54,188 --> 00:56:56,851
women in childbirth,
and there were children too.

732
00:56:56,925 --> 00:57:00,485
They used some of this diluted
penicillin against meningitis.

733
00:57:00,561 --> 00:57:02,496
The lucky children died.

734
00:57:02,563 --> 00:57:05,999
The unlucky ones went off their heads.
You can see them now in the mental ward.

735
00:57:06,066 --> 00:57:08,934
That was the racket
Harry Lime organized.

736
00:57:09,003 --> 00:57:12,200
Calloway, you haven't shown me
one shred of evidence.

737
00:57:12,273 --> 00:57:17,472
We're just coming to that.
Paine, magic lantern show.

738
00:57:17,545 --> 00:57:19,479
Very good, sir.

739
00:57:19,548 --> 00:57:21,675
Paine's one of your devoted readers.

740
00:57:21,749 --> 00:57:24,217
He's promised to lend me one
of your books. Which one is it, Paine?

741
00:57:24,286 --> 00:57:26,378
The Lone Rider of Santa Fe, sir.

742
00:57:26,454 --> 00:57:30,356
- That's right.
- I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.

743
00:57:30,425 --> 00:57:33,588
- Come on, show me what you've got to show.
- All right, Paine?

744
00:57:33,661 --> 00:57:35,289
Yes, sir.

745
00:57:37,632 --> 00:57:39,690
Paine, Paine, Paine.

746
00:57:39,768 --> 00:57:43,864
I got them muddled. It's the new lot
that's just come in for Mr. Crabbin.

747
00:57:45,773 --> 00:57:48,936
See this man here?
A fellow called Harbin,

748
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:51,876
a medical orderly
at the General Hospital.

749
00:57:51,947 --> 00:57:55,746
He worked for Lime and helped to steal
the stuff from the laboratories.

750
00:57:55,816 --> 00:58:00,481
We forced him to give information to us
which led us as far as Kurtz and Lime.

751
00:58:00,554 --> 00:58:05,356
But we didn't arrest them, as it might have
spoiled our chances of getting the others.

752
00:58:05,427 --> 00:58:08,726
- Next, Paine.
- I'd like a word with this orderly, Harbin.

753
00:58:08,796 --> 00:58:11,061
- So would I.
- Well, bring him in.

754
00:58:11,132 --> 00:58:13,691
I can't.
He disappeared a week ago.

755
00:58:13,768 --> 00:58:16,498
This is more like a mortuary
than police headquarters.

756
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:19,335
We have better witnesses.
Look here.

757
00:58:47,101 --> 00:58:49,570
How could he have done it?

758
00:58:49,637 --> 00:58:51,628
Seventy pounds a tube.

759
00:58:51,706 --> 00:58:54,936
Go back to the hotel,
and do keep out of trouble.

760
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:58,604
I'll try and fix things with the Austrian police.
You'll be all right in the hotel,

761
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:00,874
but I can't be responsible
for you on the streets.

762
00:59:00,949 --> 00:59:04,213
- I'm not asking you to.
- I'm sorry, Martins.

763
00:59:04,286 --> 00:59:06,253
I'm sorry too.

764
00:59:08,956 --> 00:59:11,220
You still got that
airplane ticket on you?

765
00:59:11,293 --> 00:59:13,887
We'll send one across
to your hotel in the morning.

766
00:59:13,961 --> 00:59:16,157
Thank you.
Excuse me.

767
00:59:16,231 --> 00:59:18,893
Get me Austrian Police Headquarters.

768
00:59:18,967 --> 00:59:21,059
Can I have that woman's passport?

769
00:59:21,135 --> 00:59:23,831
You know,
the Anna Schmidt one.

770
00:59:23,905 --> 00:59:27,170
Oh... we're not going to pick
her up for that, are we?

771
00:59:27,242 --> 00:59:30,938
What can we do?
We have our instructions.

772
01:00:16,824 --> 01:00:19,385
It's me.

773
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:25,065
It's me.

774
01:00:30,104 --> 01:00:32,039
Hello.

775
01:00:32,106 --> 01:00:34,166
What is it?
What's happened to you?

776
01:00:34,242 --> 01:00:37,802
Just came to see you.

777
01:00:37,878 --> 01:00:41,974
Come in. I thought you were going to
keep away. Are the police after you?

778
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:43,983
I don't know.

779
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:49,356
- You're drunk, aren't you?
- A bit. I'm sorry.

780
01:00:51,393 --> 01:00:55,329
But I did want to say good-bye
before I pushed off.

781
01:00:55,396 --> 01:00:57,661
- I'm going back home.
- Why?

782
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:02,894
It's what you've always wanted...
all of you.

783
01:01:03,972 --> 01:01:06,235
Kitty? Here, kitty.

784
01:01:06,307 --> 01:01:09,104
Kitty? Here, kitty.
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

785
01:01:09,177 --> 01:01:12,668
Don't you want to play, kitty?
Come on. Sleepy? Sleepy kitty?

786
01:01:14,815 --> 01:01:18,273
- Not very sociable, is he?
- No, he only liked Harry.

787
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:22,755
- What made you decide so suddenly?
- I, I brought you these.

788
01:01:22,824 --> 01:01:25,054
They, they got a little wet.

789
01:01:25,126 --> 01:01:29,085
- What happened to your hand?
- A parrot...

790
01:01:29,164 --> 01:01:32,929
- Let it go.
- Have you seen Calloway?

791
01:01:33,001 --> 01:01:36,231
- Imagine a parrot nipping a man?
- Have you?

792
01:01:36,304 --> 01:01:40,637
It's...
Oh, I, I...

793
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:43,972
I've been saying good-bye
all over, you know.

794
01:01:44,045 --> 01:01:48,572
- He told you, didn't he?
- Told me?

795
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:52,483
- About Harry.
- Do you know?

796
01:01:54,521 --> 01:01:56,887
I've seen Major Calloway today.

797
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:41,967
He is better dead.

798
01:02:42,036 --> 01:02:45,005
I knew he was mixed-up,
but not like that.

799
01:02:45,072 --> 01:02:49,032
I knew him for 20 years...
at least, I thought I knew him.

800
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:52,601
Suppose he was laughing
at fools like us all the time?

801
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:56,376
- He liked to laugh.
- Seventy pounds a tube.

802
01:02:56,450 --> 01:03:00,615
He wanted me to write
for his great medical charity.

803
01:03:00,688 --> 01:03:02,882
I'll put these flowers
in the water.

804
01:03:02,956 --> 01:03:06,688
Perhaps I could have raised
the price to 80 pounds for him.

805
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,389
Oh, please. For heaven's sake,
stop making him in your image.

806
01:03:10,465 --> 01:03:14,128
Harry was real. He wasn't
just your friend and my lover.

807
01:03:14,202 --> 01:03:18,036
- He was Harry.
- Well, don't preach wisdom to me.

808
01:03:18,106 --> 01:03:23,635
You talk about him as if
he had occasional bad manners.

809
01:03:23,711 --> 01:03:28,239
No. I don't know. I'm just
a hack writer who drinks too much...

810
01:03:28,315 --> 01:03:31,409
and falls in love with giris.

811
01:03:33,253 --> 01:03:36,815
- You.
- Me?

812
01:03:36,891 --> 01:03:39,018
Don't be such a fool.
Of course.

813
01:03:40,628 --> 01:03:43,994
If you'd rung me up and asked me
were you fair or dark...

814
01:03:44,065 --> 01:03:47,159
or had a moustache,
I wouldn't have known.

815
01:03:47,235 --> 01:03:49,168
Oh, I am leaving Vienna.

816
01:03:49,237 --> 01:03:52,900
I don't care whether Henry
was murdered by Kurtz or Popescu...

817
01:03:52,974 --> 01:03:55,407
or the third man or...

818
01:03:55,476 --> 01:04:00,880
Whoever killed him, there was
some sort of... justice.

819
01:04:00,949 --> 01:04:03,246
Maybe I would've
killed him myself.

820
01:04:03,318 --> 01:04:05,751
A person doesn't change
because you find out more.

821
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:11,190
Look. I've got a splitting headache, and you
stand there and just talk and talk and talk.

822
01:04:11,258 --> 01:04:13,920
I- I hate it.

823
01:04:13,994 --> 01:04:18,021
That's the first time
I ever saw you laugh.

824
01:04:18,099 --> 01:04:20,032
Do it again.

825
01:04:24,472 --> 01:04:26,905
There isn't enough for two laughs.

826
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:40,353
I'd make comic faces...

827
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:44,083
and stand on my head and grin
at you between my legs...

828
01:04:45,659 --> 01:04:48,856
and tell all sorts of jokes.

829
01:04:51,298 --> 01:04:53,733
I wouldn't stand a chance,
would I?

830
01:05:04,845 --> 01:05:06,780
Well...

831
01:05:08,715 --> 01:05:12,947
you did tell me I ought
to find myself a girl.

832
01:05:42,449 --> 01:05:46,284
What kind of a spy
do you think you are, satchel foot?

833
01:05:48,222 --> 01:05:50,782
What are you tailing me for?

834
01:05:53,094 --> 01:05:55,028
Cat got your tongue?

835
01:05:57,065 --> 01:05:59,499
Come on out.

836
01:05:59,566 --> 01:06:02,865
Come out, come out,
whoever you are.

837
01:06:05,005 --> 01:06:07,804
Step out in the light
and let's have a look at ya.

838
01:06:07,874 --> 01:06:11,072
Who's your boss?

839
01:06:24,425 --> 01:06:27,019
Harry.

840
01:06:53,121 --> 01:06:54,849
Harry!

841
01:07:42,068 --> 01:07:44,229
I followed his shadow...

842
01:07:44,304 --> 01:07:46,239
until, suddenly...

843
01:07:46,307 --> 01:07:49,298
- Well?
- This is where he vanished.

844
01:07:49,376 --> 01:07:52,608
- I see.
- I suppose you don't believe me.

845
01:07:52,679 --> 01:07:55,012
- No.
- Look. I tell you...

846
01:07:55,081 --> 01:07:57,311
- You don't think I'm blind, do you?
- Yes.

847
01:07:57,385 --> 01:08:00,186
- Where were you when you saw him first?
- Fifty yards right down there.

848
01:08:00,253 --> 01:08:01,342
Which side of the road?

849
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:03,322
I was on that side.
His shadow was on that side.

850
01:08:03,391 --> 01:08:06,019
- And there are no turnings on either side.
- What about the doorways?

851
01:08:06,092 --> 01:08:08,356
- I tell you, I heard him 4running ahead of me!
- Yes, yes, yes.

852
01:08:08,429 --> 01:08:11,990
And then he vanished out there, I suppose,
with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...

853
01:08:30,184 --> 01:08:32,617
It wasn't the German gin.

854
01:09:00,847 --> 01:09:03,816
Well, what's this?
Where are we?

855
01:09:03,885 --> 01:09:06,819
It's the main sewer.

856
01:09:06,887 --> 01:09:10,721
Runs right into the blue Danube.
Smells sweet, doesn't it?

857
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:17,325
We should have dug deeper
than a grave.

858
01:10:05,046 --> 01:10:06,980
You knew him, Major?

859
01:10:07,047 --> 01:10:10,539
Hmm. Yes.

860
01:10:10,618 --> 01:10:12,643
Yes. Joseph Harbin.

861
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,279
Medical orderly
at the General Hospital.

862
01:10:17,457 --> 01:10:20,291
- He used to work for Harry Lime.
- Joseph Harbin?

863
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:25,127
Yes. He's the man
I told you was missing.

864
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,091
Next time we'll have
a foolproof coffin.

865
01:11:32,298 --> 01:11:34,994
- Fraulein Schmidt?
- Ja.

866
01:12:38,733 --> 01:12:40,086
Where are you taking me?

867
01:12:40,087 --> 01:12:42,793
International Police Headquarters,
just to check up.

868
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:54,247
I'm sorry, miss. It's orders.
We can't go against the protocol.

869
01:12:54,314 --> 01:12:57,283
- I don't even know what protocol means.
- Neither do I, miss.

870
01:12:57,350 --> 01:13:00,444
Mademoiselle,
your lipstick.

871
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,454
Thank you.

872
01:13:15,101 --> 01:13:17,695
- Anna, what's happened to you?
- All right. Keep out of this.

873
01:13:17,771 --> 01:13:20,569
Listen, I've got to talk to you.
I've just seen a dead man walking.

874
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,235
- All right, chum. Get back.
- I saw him buried.

875
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:27,109
But now I've seen him alive.

876
01:13:33,753 --> 01:13:36,221
Just a minute.
Bring her in here.

877
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:43,091
You stay out here.

878
01:13:43,163 --> 01:13:47,430
Come in, Miss Schmidt.
Now then, Miss Schmidt.

879
01:13:47,501 --> 01:13:50,936
I'm not interested in your forged
papers. That's purely a Russian case.

880
01:13:51,005 --> 01:13:54,440
- When did you last see Lime?
- Two weeks ago.

881
01:13:54,507 --> 01:13:57,806
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt.
We know he's alive.

882
01:13:57,877 --> 01:14:02,109
- It is true, then.
- Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.

883
01:14:03,617 --> 01:14:05,551
What did you say?
I'm sorry.

884
01:14:05,618 --> 01:14:09,110
I said another man
was buried in his place.

885
01:14:09,189 --> 01:14:11,123
Where's Harry?

886
01:14:11,191 --> 01:14:13,819
That's what we want
to find out.

887
01:14:15,395 --> 01:14:19,162
I'm sorry. I don't seem able
to understand anything you say. I...

888
01:14:20,234 --> 01:14:22,167
He is alive.

889
01:14:22,235 --> 01:14:24,328
Now this minute,
he is doing something.

890
01:14:24,404 --> 01:14:28,431
Miss Schmidt, we know he's somewhere
across the canal in the Russian sector.

891
01:14:28,508 --> 01:14:30,773
You may as well help us.
In a few minutes,

892
01:14:30,845 --> 01:14:33,313
Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you
about your papers.

893
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:36,940
- Tell me where Lime is.
- I don't know.

894
01:14:37,016 --> 01:14:40,383
If you help me,
I am prepared to help you.

895
01:14:40,453 --> 01:14:43,945
Martins always said
you were a fool.

896
01:14:44,024 --> 01:14:47,585
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt.
He can't get away. Right.

897
01:14:47,661 --> 01:14:49,595
Poor Harry.

898
01:14:50,831 --> 01:14:53,163
I wish he was dead.

899
01:14:54,268 --> 01:14:56,735
He would be safe
from all of you, then.

900
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:09,712
Why, that's you!
Come up.

901
01:15:09,783 --> 01:15:12,615
Winkel, look who is here.

902
01:15:12,685 --> 01:15:14,619
I want to speak to you, Kurtz.

903
01:15:14,688 --> 01:15:17,212
- Of course. Come up.
- I'll wait here.

904
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:20,748
- I don't understand.
- I want to talk to Harry.

905
01:15:21,929 --> 01:15:24,055
- Are you mad?
- All right. I'm mad.

906
01:15:24,131 --> 01:15:27,760
I've seen a ghost.
You tell Harry I want to see him.

907
01:15:29,203 --> 01:15:31,466
Be reasonable.
Come up and talk.

908
01:15:31,538 --> 01:15:35,167
No, thank you.
I like the open.

909
01:15:35,242 --> 01:15:39,144
Tell him I'll wait
by that wheel there.

910
01:15:39,212 --> 01:15:42,148
Or do ghosts only rise
by night, Dr. Winkel?

911
01:15:43,751 --> 01:15:46,548
You got an opinion on that?

912
01:16:48,515 --> 01:16:52,575
- Hello, old man. How are you?
- Hello, Harry.

913
01:16:52,653 --> 01:16:55,314
Well, well, they seem to be
giving you quite some busy time.

914
01:16:55,389 --> 01:16:57,721
- Well, listen. I want to talk to you.
- Hmm, yes?

915
01:16:57,791 --> 01:17:01,351
Talk to me?
Well, of course. Come on.

916
01:17:04,198 --> 01:17:06,529
Kids used to ride this thing
a lot in the old days.

917
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:10,832
But they haven't the money now, poor devils.

918
01:17:10,904 --> 01:17:13,838
Listen, Harry.
I didn't believe that...

919
01:17:13,907 --> 01:17:16,534
- It's good to see you, Holly.
- I was at your funeral.

920
01:17:16,609 --> 01:17:19,078
That was pretty smart,
wasn't it?

921
01:17:19,145 --> 01:17:21,306
Oh, the same old indigestion, Holly.

922
01:17:21,381 --> 01:17:23,542
These are the only things
that help, these tablets.

923
01:17:23,617 --> 01:17:26,346
These are the last. Can't get 'em
anywhere in Europe anymore.

924
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:28,854
- Do you know what's happened to your girl?
- Hmm?

925
01:17:28,922 --> 01:17:31,652
- She's been arrested.
- Tough, very tough, but don't worry, old man.

926
01:17:31,725 --> 01:17:34,386
- They won't hurt her.
- They're handing her over to the Russians.

927
01:17:34,461 --> 01:17:36,690
What can I do, old man?
I'm dead, aren't I?

928
01:17:36,764 --> 01:17:38,698
- You can help some.
- Holly,

929
01:17:38,765 --> 01:17:41,529
exactly who did you tell
about me, hmm?

930
01:17:41,601 --> 01:17:44,570
- I told the police.
- Unwise, Holly.

931
01:17:44,637 --> 01:17:46,832
- And Anna.
- Unwise.

932
01:17:46,907 --> 01:17:49,636
Did the, uh,
police believe you?

933
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:51,677
You don't care anything at all
about Anna, do you?

934
01:17:51,744 --> 01:17:53,679
I've got quite a lot on my mind.

935
01:17:53,747 --> 01:17:56,215
- You wouldn't do anything.
- What do you want me to do? Be reasonable.

936
01:17:56,283 --> 01:17:58,979
- You can get somebody else...
- Do you expect me to give myself up?

937
01:17:59,052 --> 01:18:01,487
- Why not?
- It's a far better thing that I do...

938
01:18:01,555 --> 01:18:03,488
with the old limelight
than follow the curtain...

939
01:18:03,556 --> 01:18:06,855
No. You and I aren't heroes.
The worid doesn't make any heroes...

940
01:18:06,926 --> 01:18:09,360
- You've got plenty of contacts.
- Outside of your stories.

941
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:11,398
I've got to be so careful.

942
01:18:11,465 --> 01:18:14,865
I'm only safe in the Russian zone. I'm
only safe as long as they can use me.

943
01:18:14,935 --> 01:18:18,063
- As long as they can use you?
- I wish I could get rid of this thing.

944
01:18:18,137 --> 01:18:21,630
So that's how they found out about Anna.
You told them, didn't you?

945
01:18:21,707 --> 01:18:23,676
Don't try to be a policeman,
old man.

946
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:26,177
- What do you expect me to be? Part of your...
- Part?

947
01:18:26,246 --> 01:18:30,011
You can have any part as long as you don't
interfere. I've never cut you out of anything.

948
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:33,747
Yes, I remember when they raided the
gambling joint, you knew a safe way out.

949
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:36,756
- Sure!
- Yeah, safe for you. Not safe for me.

950
01:18:36,823 --> 01:18:41,488
Old man, you never should have
gone to the police, you know.

951
01:18:41,561 --> 01:18:44,530
You ought to leave
this thing alone.

952
01:18:44,597 --> 01:18:47,430
Have you ever seen
any of your victims?

953
01:18:47,501 --> 01:18:50,902
You know, I never feel comfortable
on these sort of things.

954
01:18:50,971 --> 01:18:53,496
Victims?
Don't be melodramatic.

955
01:18:55,374 --> 01:18:57,502
Tell me.

956
01:18:57,578 --> 01:19:02,413
Would you really feel any pity if one
of those dots stopped moving forever?

957
01:19:02,483 --> 01:19:05,680
If I offered you 20,000
for every dot that stopped,

958
01:19:05,752 --> 01:19:08,185
would you really, old man,
tell me to keep my money?

959
01:19:08,255 --> 01:19:12,282
Or would you calculate how many
dots you could afford to spend?

960
01:19:12,359 --> 01:19:15,293
Free of income tax, old man.
Free of income tax...

961
01:19:15,362 --> 01:19:18,091
the only way
you can save money nowadays.

962
01:19:18,164 --> 01:19:21,622
- A lot of good your money will do you in jail.
- That jail's in another zone.

963
01:19:22,836 --> 01:19:25,633
There's no proof against me,

964
01:19:25,706 --> 01:19:27,640
besides you.

965
01:19:34,948 --> 01:19:37,109
I should be pretty easy
to get rid of.

966
01:19:39,485 --> 01:19:42,386
- Pretty easy.
- I wouldn't be too sure.

967
01:19:42,456 --> 01:19:45,323
I carry a gun.

968
01:19:45,391 --> 01:19:48,850
I don't think they'd look for a bullet
wound after you hit that ground.

969
01:19:51,631 --> 01:19:53,725
They dug up your coffin.

970
01:19:57,538 --> 01:19:59,471
And found Harbin?

971
01:20:04,077 --> 01:20:06,011
Mm-hmm.

972
01:20:08,148 --> 01:20:10,207
Pity.

973
01:20:10,283 --> 01:20:13,810
Holly, what fools we are
talking to each other this way,

974
01:20:13,886 --> 01:20:16,650
as though I'd do anything to you
or you to me.

975
01:20:16,722 --> 01:20:19,520
You're just a little mixed-up
about things in general.

976
01:20:19,592 --> 01:20:23,359
Nobody thinks in terms
of human beings.

977
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:25,363
Governments don't.
Why should we?

978
01:20:25,431 --> 01:20:29,095
They talk about the people and the proletariat.
I talk about the suckers and the mugs.

979
01:20:29,168 --> 01:20:35,038
It's the same thing. They have their
five-year plans, and so have I.

980
01:20:35,108 --> 01:20:37,804
You used to believe in God.

981
01:20:37,877 --> 01:20:40,641
I still do believe in God,
old man.

982
01:20:41,747 --> 01:20:45,479
I believe in God and mercy
and all that.

983
01:20:45,551 --> 01:20:47,917
But the dead are happier dead.

984
01:20:47,988 --> 01:20:51,082
They don't miss much here,
poor devils.

985
01:20:54,795 --> 01:20:56,729
What do you believe in?

986
01:20:56,797 --> 01:21:00,233
Oh, if we ever get Anna out
of this mess, be kind to her.

987
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:02,291
I think you'll find
she's worth it.

988
01:21:02,368 --> 01:21:05,462
I wish I'd asked you to bring me
some of these tablets from home.

989
01:21:05,538 --> 01:21:09,305
Holly, I'd like to cut you in,
old man.

990
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:13,436
There's nobody left in Vienna I can really trust,
and we've always done everything together.

991
01:21:13,512 --> 01:21:16,913
When you make up your mind, send me a message.
I'll meet you anyplace, anytime.

992
01:21:16,984 --> 01:21:19,953
And when we do meet, old man,
it's you I want to see,

993
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:22,180
not the police.

994
01:21:22,256 --> 01:21:24,189
Remember that, won't you?

995
01:21:24,257 --> 01:21:27,819
And don't be so gloomy!
After all, it's not that awful.

996
01:21:27,894 --> 01:21:30,362
Remember what the fella said:

997
01:21:30,430 --> 01:21:35,094
In Italy, for 30 years under the Borgias,
they had warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed.

998
01:21:35,167 --> 01:21:38,797
But they produced Michelangelo,
Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance.

999
01:21:38,872 --> 01:21:41,271
In Switzerland,
they had brotherly love.

1000
01:21:41,341 --> 01:21:45,868
They had 500 years of democracy
and peace, and what did that produce?

1001
01:21:45,945 --> 01:21:48,743
The cuckoo clock.
So long, Holly.

1002
01:21:56,989 --> 01:21:59,753
But look here, Martins.
You can always arrange to meet him at,

1003
01:21:59,825 --> 01:22:02,555
at some little cafe here
in the international zone.

1004
01:22:02,628 --> 01:22:04,563
- It would never work.
- We'll never get him in the Russian zone.

1005
01:22:04,631 --> 01:22:07,429
Calloway, you expect too much.

1006
01:22:07,501 --> 01:22:10,470
Oh, I know he deserves to hang.
You've proved your stuff,

1007
01:22:10,537 --> 01:22:13,994
but 20 years is a long time.

1008
01:22:14,073 --> 01:22:16,702
Don't ask me to tie the rope.

1009
01:22:16,777 --> 01:22:19,041
Okay. Forget it.

1010
01:22:19,112 --> 01:22:22,274
- Busy, Major?
- What is it, Brodsky?

1011
01:22:22,349 --> 01:22:25,749
We have identified the girl.
Here is her report.

1012
01:22:27,354 --> 01:22:29,548
I've questioned her.
We've got nothing against her.

1013
01:22:29,622 --> 01:22:33,081
We shall apply for her at
the Four Power meeting tomorrow.

1014
01:22:33,159 --> 01:22:35,788
She has no right to be here.

1015
01:22:37,363 --> 01:22:40,230
I've asked your people
to help with Lime.

1016
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:43,997
That's a different case.
It is being looked into.

1017
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:46,471
So long, Major.

1018
01:22:46,539 --> 01:22:51,704
In the last war, a general would
hang his opponent's picture on the wall.

1019
01:22:51,778 --> 01:22:53,904
He got to know him that way.

1020
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:56,881
I'm beginning to know Lime.

1021
01:22:56,949 --> 01:23:01,046
I think this would've worked,
with your help.

1022
01:23:07,461 --> 01:23:09,395
What price would you pay?

1023
01:23:16,002 --> 01:23:18,527
Name it.

1024
01:23:46,666 --> 01:23:49,328
Here we are.
You'll be all right here, miss.

1025
01:23:52,939 --> 01:23:55,430
I don't understand
Major Calloway. I...

1026
01:23:55,508 --> 01:23:59,411
- I expect he's got a soft spot for you, miss.
- Why has he done all this?

1027
01:23:59,479 --> 01:24:03,438
Don't you worry, miss.
You're well out of things.

1028
01:24:03,516 --> 01:24:05,507
There we are, miss.

1029
01:24:05,585 --> 01:24:09,077
- Thank you. You've been so kind.
- Well, I'll be saying good night.

1030
01:24:11,291 --> 01:24:13,815
- Good night, miss.
- Good-bye.

1031
01:24:51,198 --> 01:24:55,793
- Are you going too?
- Oh.

1032
01:24:55,868 --> 01:24:59,167
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you off.

1033
01:24:59,238 --> 01:25:01,002
See me off?
From here?

1034
01:25:01,073 --> 01:25:05,773
Oh, I watched you onto the train, uh...
No harm in that, is there?

1035
01:25:05,846 --> 01:25:08,279
How did you know
I'd be here?

1036
01:25:08,347 --> 01:25:12,113
I heard something about it
at police headquarters.

1037
01:25:12,185 --> 01:25:14,676
Have you been seeing
Major Calloway again?

1038
01:25:14,753 --> 01:25:17,551
Of course not.
I don't live in his pocket.

1039
01:25:18,925 --> 01:25:20,859
Harry, what is it?

1040
01:25:22,328 --> 01:25:25,320
- For heaven sakes, stop calling me Harry.
- I'm sorry.

1041
01:25:25,398 --> 01:25:27,490
Let's go.

1042
01:25:27,566 --> 01:25:29,591
What's on your mind?
Why did you hide here?

1043
01:25:29,668 --> 01:25:33,297
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
Here. It'll be cold on that train.

1044
01:25:33,372 --> 01:25:35,932
- I shall be all right.
- You send me a wire as soon as you are.

1045
01:25:36,008 --> 01:25:38,806
- What's going to happen? Where is Harry?
- He's safe in the Russian zone.

1046
01:25:38,878 --> 01:25:41,176
- How do you know?
- Well, I saw him today.

1047
01:25:41,247 --> 01:25:43,681
- How is he?
- He can look after himself. Don't worry.

1048
01:25:43,749 --> 01:25:46,650
- Did he say anything about me? Tell me!
- Oh, the usual things.

1049
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,759
Is something wrong?
Did you tell Calloway about Harry?

1050
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:49,779
Of course I didn't.

1051
01:25:49,855 --> 01:25:52,586
Why should he help me?
The Russians will make trouble for him.

1052
01:25:52,658 --> 01:25:55,525
- That's his headache. Oh, Anna!
- His? Why are you lying?

1053
01:25:55,595 --> 01:25:58,256
- We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
- I'm not going.

1054
01:25:58,331 --> 01:26:00,525
You'd...

1055
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:04,091
Anna, don't you recognize
a good turn when you see one?

1056
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:06,730
You have seen Calloway?
What are you two doing?

1057
01:26:08,774 --> 01:26:12,734
Well, they, they asked me
to help take him.

1058
01:26:12,811 --> 01:26:14,746
I'm helping.

1059
01:26:23,890 --> 01:26:27,121
- Poor Harry.
- Poor Harry.

1060
01:26:29,095 --> 01:26:33,395
Poor Harry... wouldn't even
lift a finger to help you.

1061
01:26:33,466 --> 01:26:37,402
Oh, you've got your precious honesty
and don't want anything else.

1062
01:26:37,470 --> 01:26:39,438
You still want him.

1063
01:26:39,506 --> 01:26:41,667
I don't want him anymore.

1064
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:46,700
I don't want to see him, hear him, but
he's still a part of me. That's a fact.

1065
01:26:46,779 --> 01:26:49,112
I couldn't do a thing
to harm him.

1066
01:27:07,967 --> 01:27:13,304
Oh, Anna, why do we always
have to quarrel?

1067
01:27:13,372 --> 01:27:17,742
If you want to sell your services,
I'm not willing to be the price.

1068
01:27:20,447 --> 01:27:23,609
I loved him.
You loved him.

1069
01:27:23,682 --> 01:27:26,880
What good have we done him...
for love?

1070
01:27:28,755 --> 01:27:30,746
Look at yourself.

1071
01:27:30,823 --> 01:27:34,157
They have a name
for faces like that.

1072
01:27:55,782 --> 01:27:57,841
- Calloway.
- Come in here. There isn't much time.

1073
01:27:57,917 --> 01:28:01,181
I want to get a plane
out of here tonight.

1074
01:28:01,253 --> 01:28:04,018
- So she talked you out of it.
- Gave me these.

1075
01:28:05,457 --> 01:28:07,448
A girl of spirit.

1076
01:28:07,527 --> 01:28:11,587
She's right.
It is none of my business.

1077
01:28:11,664 --> 01:28:15,863
It won't make any difference
in the long run. I'll get him.

1078
01:28:15,935 --> 01:28:20,372
- Well, I won't have helped.
- That'll be a fine boast to make.

1079
01:28:20,439 --> 01:28:22,525
Well, I always wanted you
to catch that plane, didn't I?

1080
01:28:22,526 --> 01:28:23,568
You all did.

1081
01:28:23,643 --> 01:28:28,376
I'd better see if there's anyone still
at the terminus. You may need a priority.

1082
01:28:30,249 --> 01:28:32,547
Mind if I drop off
somewhere on the way?

1083
01:28:32,618 --> 01:28:34,452
I've got an appointment.
It won't take five minutes.

1084
01:28:34,453 --> 01:28:35,520
Of course.

1085
01:28:35,587 --> 01:28:38,681
Why don't you come in too?
You're a writer. It might interest you.

1086
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:42,894
This is the biggest children's
hospital in Vienna.

1087
01:28:42,962 --> 01:28:46,158
All the kids in here are the result
of Lime's penicillin racket.

1088
01:29:06,786 --> 01:29:11,119
He'd had meningitis.
They gave it some of Lime's penicillin.

1089
01:29:12,158 --> 01:29:14,091
Terrible pity, isn't it?

1090
01:29:41,121 --> 01:29:45,148
Paine lent me one of your books.
Oklahoma Kid, I think it was.

1091
01:29:45,225 --> 01:29:47,819
I read a bit of it. Looks as if
it's gonna be pretty good.

1092
01:29:47,894 --> 01:29:52,331
What made you take up this sort
of thing? Been doing it for long?

1093
01:29:52,398 --> 01:29:53,486
All right, Calloway. You win.

1094
01:29:53,487 --> 01:29:55,663
I never knew there were
snake charmers in Texas.

1095
01:29:55,734 --> 01:29:58,726
- I said you win.
- Win what?

1096
01:29:58,805 --> 01:30:03,400
I'll be your...
dumb decoy duck.

1097
01:30:56,796 --> 01:30:58,730
Psst!

1098
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:10,175
Paine.

1099
01:31:36,002 --> 01:31:37,935
Look, sir!

1100
01:31:44,676 --> 01:31:46,610
How much longer
are you going to sit here?

1101
01:31:46,679 --> 01:31:48,703
Shall I go over there, sir?

1102
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:51,716
No. No,
leave them for a while.

1103
01:32:11,304 --> 01:32:13,863
Mein Herr, Ballon?

1104
01:32:13,939 --> 01:32:16,430
Nein, danke. Nein.

1105
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:21,542
Ballon?

1106
01:32:21,613 --> 01:32:25,640
Go on. Hop it, scarper.

1107
01:32:25,717 --> 01:32:29,484
Ballon, mein Herr?

1108
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:38,895
All right, all right.
Only one. Go on, scarper.

1109
01:33:16,502 --> 01:33:20,336
You should have gone.
How did you know I was here, anyway?

1110
01:33:20,405 --> 01:33:23,898
From Kurtz.
They have just been arrested.

1111
01:33:23,976 --> 01:33:26,877
But Harry won't come.
He's not a fool.

1112
01:33:26,945 --> 01:33:29,744
Yes, Paine. Slip over there.
See what she's up to.

1113
01:33:29,745 --> 01:33:31,144
Right, sir.

1114
01:33:31,216 --> 01:33:34,515
Don't tell me you are doing
all this for nothing.

1115
01:33:36,288 --> 01:33:38,722
- What's your price this time?
- No price, Anna.

1116
01:33:38,791 --> 01:33:41,588
Honest, sensible, sober,

1117
01:33:41,661 --> 01:33:43,993
harmless Holly Martins.

1118
01:33:44,063 --> 01:33:47,225
Holly.
What a silly name.

1119
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:51,998
You must feel very proud
to be a police informer.

1120
01:33:53,939 --> 01:33:57,306
Harry, get away!
The police are outside!

1121
01:33:57,377 --> 01:33:58,742
- Quick!
- Anna.

1122
01:34:04,149 --> 01:34:06,550
Sir, the back!

1123
01:35:07,512 --> 01:35:09,447
All right.

1124
01:35:18,858 --> 01:35:20,792
Martins, get back!

1125
01:39:33,979 --> 01:39:37,971
Harry!

1126
01:39:38,050 --> 01:39:39,881
- Is that you?
- You're through.

1127
01:39:39,952 --> 01:39:42,045
Come out. You haven't
got a chance this way.

1128
01:39:42,121 --> 01:39:45,215
- What do you want?
- You might as well give up.

1129
01:39:45,291 --> 01:39:48,260
Mr. Martins, sir,
get back, get back!

1130
01:39:48,327 --> 01:39:51,489
Keep back, sir!
Come back! Come back, sir!

1131
01:41:27,025 --> 01:41:29,153
Martins! Martins!

1132
01:41:29,228 --> 01:41:31,992
Be careful, Martins.

1133
01:41:32,064 --> 01:41:36,363
Don't take any chances.
If you see him, shoot!

1134
01:42:36,929 --> 01:42:38,920
What time is it?

1135
01:42:38,997 --> 01:42:41,488
2:30.

1136
01:42:45,136 --> 01:42:48,402
I'll have to step on it
if you're going to catch that plane.

1137
01:42:48,474 --> 01:42:52,569
Calloway, can't you
do something about Anna?

1138
01:42:52,645 --> 01:42:56,103
I'll do what I can,
if she'll let me.

1139
01:43:06,358 --> 01:43:10,225
- Wait a minute. Let me out.
- Well, there's not much time.

1140
01:43:10,296 --> 01:43:14,231
One can't just leave.
Please.

1141
01:43:15,333 --> 01:43:17,699
Be sensible, Martins.

1142
01:43:17,770 --> 01:43:20,398
I haven't got a sensible name,
Calloway.

1143
01:43:21,305 --> 01:43:27,449
