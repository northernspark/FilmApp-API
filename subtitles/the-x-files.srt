00:05:41,347 --> 00:05:43,735
Hey, Stevie, you okay?

3
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,537
I got...

4
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,979
I got the wind knocked out of me.

5
00:05:54,064 --> 00:05:55,782
Looks like a cave or something ...

6
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:08,495
Stevie, what's goin' on?

7
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,936
It's a human skull!

8
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:18,169
- Toss it up here!
- No way! It's mine.

9
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:21,728
Anyway, there's bones
all over the place, man!

10
00:06:35,374 --> 00:06:36,853
What the...

11
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:00,760
Stevie?

12
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:02,998
- Hey, Stevie!
- You okay?

13
00:07:06,287 --> 00:07:09,518
Hey, man... let's get outta here!

14
00:07:49,277 --> 00:07:51,268
Give me a 14-footer!

15
00:07:53,076 --> 00:07:57,193
This is Captain Miles Cooles.
Rescue situation in progress.

16
00:07:57,275 --> 00:08:01,506
Rope's in the hole.
Let's go. Two down.

17
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:10,064
What ya got, TC? Talk to me.

18
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:14,183
Do you see the boy?

19
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:20,867
Come back, TC. You see the kid?

20
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,386
Danny, check TC's radio.

21
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:26,823
TC?

22
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:28,899
Glenn, Sal, in the hole!

23
00:08:59,141 --> 00:09:02,735
- Get those people outta here!
- Move 'em back!

24
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,333
Move back, folks!

25
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:11,535
I sent four men down there for the boy.
Report is, his eyes had turned black.

26
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:14,893
Now we've lost communication with my men.

27
00:09:29,414 --> 00:09:31,291
What about my men?

28
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:37,640
What about my men!

29
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:52,438
What the hell is this?

30
00:10:20,042 --> 00:10:21,680
It's Bronschweig.

31
00:10:21,762 --> 00:10:26,437
Sir, the impossible scenario
that we never planned for?

32
00:10:26,801 --> 00:10:29,234
We'd better come up with a plan.

33
00:11:00,673 --> 00:11:03,266
We've evacuated the building.

34
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:08,709
- There's no trace of an explosive device.
- You sent the dogs through?

35
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:09,667
Yes, sir.

36
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:11,502
Send 'em through again.

37
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,428
All right, guys.

38
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,500
Let's do it again!

39
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,459
Mulder, it's me.

40
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:48,851
- Where are you, Scully?
- On the roof.

41
00:11:48,982 --> 00:11:51,654
- Find anyhing?
- No, I haven't.

42
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,649
What's wrong?

43
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:57,289
I just climbed up 12 floors,
I'm hot, I'm thirsty...

44
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,132
...and I'm wondering what I'm doing.

45
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,016
You're looking for a bomb.

46
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:05,374
But the threat was made
on the Federal Building.

47
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,448
They have that covered.

48
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:14,009
When a bomb threat is called in, the rational
purpose of it is to allow us to find the bomb.

49
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:18,373
The rational object of terrorism
is to promote terror.

50
00:12:18,455 --> 00:12:24,926
There's a model behavioral pattern for every
case where a threat has turned up a bomb.

51
00:12:25,213 --> 00:12:28,649
And if we ignore that data, as we have done...

52
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:33,327
...the chances are great that,
if there is a bomb, we might not find it.

53
00:12:33,411 --> 00:12:35,402
Lives could be lost.

54
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:36,401
Mulder?

55
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,918
Mulder?

56
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:39,760
Boom!

57
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,203
Jesus, Mulder!

58
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,644
Whatever happened to hunches?

59
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,766
Random acts of unpredictability.

60
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:53,285
If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen
in a universe of infinite possibilities...

61
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:58,884
...we may find ourselves at the mercy
of anything that cannot be categorized.

62
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:05,238
What are we doin' up here, Scully?
It's hotter than hell.

63
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:14,395
I know you're bored, but unconventional
thinking will only get you into trouble now.

64
00:13:14,482 --> 00:13:18,952
- Why do you think I'm bored?
- Quit looking for what isn't there.

65
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:22,237
They've closed the X-Files.
We follow procedure now.

66
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,916
Let's make a bomb threat to Houston.
It's free-beer night at the Astrodome.

67
00:13:32,518 --> 00:13:33,428
Now what?

68
00:13:33,518 --> 00:13:35,109
It's locked?

69
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:38,154
So much for anticipating the unforeseen!

70
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:43,304
- I had you.
- No, you didn't.

71
00:13:43,395 --> 00:13:45,750
- I had you big time.
- You had nothing.

72
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:47,392
I saw you jiggle the handle.

73
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:52,908
I saw your face.
There was a definite moment of panic.

74
00:13:52,993 --> 00:13:56,951
You've never seen me panic.
When I panic, I make this face.

75
00:13:57,032 --> 00:13:58,101
That was it.

76
00:13:58,192 --> 00:14:02,184
- You didn't see that face.
- I saw that face. You're buying.

77
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,146
Coke? Pepsi? Saline IV?

78
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,220
Somethin' sweet.

79
00:15:23,932 --> 00:15:26,684
Scully.

80
00:15:26,771 --> 00:15:28,363
I've found the bomb.

81
00:15:28,451 --> 00:15:31,522
You're funny. Where are you, Mulder?

82
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,841
I'm in the vending room.

83
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:38,167
Is that you pounding?

84
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:41,320
Yeah. Get somebody to open that door.

85
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:45,397
- Nice try, Mulder.
- It's in the soda machine.

86
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,761
You got 14 minutes to evacuate.

87
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,158
Come on, Mulder.

88
00:15:51,246 --> 00:15:52,598
13.56...

89
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,676
13.54...

90
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,160
13.52...

91
00:15:57,244 --> 00:15:58,438
13.50...

92
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:02,516
You see a pattern emerging here, Scully?

93
00:16:09,361 --> 00:16:11,192
I'll get you outta there!

94
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,351
I need this building evacuated in ten minutes!

95
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:23,670
Have the fire department block off
a one-mile radius around the building!

96
00:16:23,758 --> 00:16:27,193
- Ten minutes?
- Don't think! Just make it happen!

97
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,670
This is Security...

98
00:16:30,996 --> 00:16:35,068
This is Special Agent Dana Scully.
I need to speak with SAC Michaud.

99
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:37,111
He's got the wrong building.

100
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:55,064
- Where is it?
- Vending machine.

101
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:57,027
He's locked in with it.

102
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:21,340
You know that face I just showed you?
I'm making it again.

103
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:25,453
Move away from the door.
We're coming through.

104
00:17:37,901 --> 00:17:39,016
Clear!

105
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:49,171
Tell me that's just soda pop
in those canisters.

106
00:17:54,857 --> 00:17:57,734
It's just what it looks like. A big IED.

107
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,333
Ten gallons of Astrolite.

108
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:06,327
Okay. Get everybody outta here.
Clear the area.

109
00:18:07,814 --> 00:18:12,329
- Someone's gotta stay here with you.
- I gave you an order to evacuate.

110
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:14,482
Can you defuse it?

111
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:16,651
Yes, I can.

112
00:18:16,732 --> 00:18:20,724
- We got four minutes to find out.
- Did you hear what I said?

113
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:23,040
Get out!

114
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,327
Come on, Mulder.

115
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,630
Mulder, what are you doing!

116
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:14,312
- Something's wrong!
- Mulder!

117
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:18,393
- Something's not right.
- Get in the car! There's no time!

118
00:19:19,597 --> 00:19:20,825
Let's go!

119
00:19:31,155 --> 00:19:33,145
Come on, come on!

120
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,532
Next time, you're buying.

121
00:20:51,696 --> 00:20:54,846
In light of Waco and Ruby Ridge...

122
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:59,450
...there is a need at the Attorney General's
office to place responsibility...

123
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:05,324
...for the catastrophic destruction of public
property and loss of life due to terrorism.

124
00:21:05,413 --> 00:21:09,849
Details are unclear, but we're under
pressure from the Attorney General...

125
00:21:09,932 --> 00:21:14,322
...to give a true account of what happened,
so she can issue a public statement.

126
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:18,801
We know now that five people
died in the explosion:

127
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,044
Special...

128
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:28,437
Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud
who was trying to defuse the bomb...

129
00:21:28,527 --> 00:21:31,087
...three firemen from Dallas, and a young boy.

130
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:37,161
Excuse me? The firemen and the young boy
were found in the building?

131
00:21:37,245 --> 00:21:42,523
Agent Mulder, since you weren't on time
for this hearing, please step outside...

132
00:21:42,604 --> 00:21:47,154
...so that we can hear
Agent Scully's version of the facts.

133
00:21:47,243 --> 00:21:53,477
- We were told the building was clear.
- You'll get your turn. Please step outside.

134
00:22:12,677 --> 00:22:15,873
They're still talking to Agent Scully.

135
00:22:16,156 --> 00:22:17,635
About what?

136
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:21,788
They want to know why
she was in the wrong building.

137
00:22:21,915 --> 00:22:23,906
She was with me.

138
00:22:26,674 --> 00:22:32,066
You don't get it, do you? There's $45 million
worth of damage to the city of Dallas.

139
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:35,064
Lives have been lost.
No suspects have been named.

140
00:22:35,152 --> 00:22:38,587
The story is that
this could've been prevented.

141
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:40,707
They wanna blame us?

142
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:46,861
We both know that if it looks bad,
it's bad for the FBI.

143
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,509
Blame has to be assigned somewhere.

144
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:56,344
- But Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
- She's saying the same about you.

145
00:22:56,427 --> 00:23:02,183
I breached protocol. I broke contact with
the SAC. I left him alone with the device.

146
00:23:02,266 --> 00:23:05,257
Agent Scully says you wanted to go back.

147
00:23:05,345 --> 00:23:06,539
No.

148
00:23:14,023 --> 00:23:16,411
They're asking for you, sir.

149
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:18,975
Thank you.

150
00:23:22,421 --> 00:23:26,936
- You don't have to protect me.
- I told them the truth.

151
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,374
They're trying to divide us.

152
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:33,649
They have divided us. They're splitting us up.

153
00:23:33,738 --> 00:23:36,013
What are you talking about?

154
00:23:36,098 --> 00:23:39,646
I meet with OPR in two days
for reassignment.

155
00:23:39,737 --> 00:23:41,090
They put us together!

156
00:23:41,177 --> 00:23:45,328
So I could invalidate your investigations
into the paranormal. But...

157
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:47,645
...I think this goes deeper than that now.

158
00:23:47,735 --> 00:23:51,727
- They're doing this to me.
- They're not doing this.

159
00:23:55,253 --> 00:24:01,043
I left behind a career in medicine because
I thought I could make a difference at the FBI.

160
00:24:01,132 --> 00:24:03,850
But it hasn't turned out that way.

161
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:09,527
And now if they transfer me to Omaha
or Cleveland or some field office...

162
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:16,446
...it doesn't hold the interest for me that it
once did. Not after what I've seen and done.

163
00:24:18,448 --> 00:24:20,166
You're quitting.

164
00:24:22,247 --> 00:24:26,159
Maybe you should ask yourself
if your heart's still in it, too.

165
00:24:30,805 --> 00:24:33,523
Agent Mulder, you're up.

166
00:24:33,604 --> 00:24:35,595
I'm sorry.

167
00:24:38,403 --> 00:24:39,438
Mulder...

168
00:24:43,402 --> 00:24:45,074
Good luck.

169
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:11,988
I'd say this about exceeds
your minimum daily requirement.

170
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:19,190
Whoa! You've gotta train
for that kind of heavy lifting.

171
00:25:20,154 --> 00:25:22,144
Poopy day?

172
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:28,505
So...

173
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:30,309
...what do you do?

174
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:33,228
- What do I do?
- Mm-hm.

175
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:42,976
I'm the key figure in a government plot
to deny the existence of extraterrestrials.

176
00:25:43,068 --> 00:25:48,141
It's a global conspiracy with key players
in the highest levels of power.

177
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:52,822
And it reaches down into the lives of every
man, woman and child on this planet.

178
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:57,543
So, of course, no-one believes me.

179
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:01,856
I'm an annoyance to my superiors,
a joke to my peers. They call me Spooky.

180
00:26:02,024 --> 00:26:05,174
Spooky Mulder,
whose sister was abducted by aliens...

181
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:08,732
...who chases after little green men
with a badge and a gun...

182
00:26:08,822 --> 00:26:11,894
...shouting to the heavens
to anyone who will listen...

183
00:26:11,982 --> 00:26:14,051
...that the sky is falling.

184
00:26:14,141 --> 00:26:18,497
And when it hits,
it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.

185
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:23,018
Well...

186
00:26:24,579 --> 00:26:28,207
- I would say that about does it, Spooky.
- Does what?

187
00:26:28,298 --> 00:26:31,050
Looks like 86 is your lucky number.

188
00:26:40,175 --> 00:26:43,689
You know, one is the Ioneliest number.

189
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:16,877
Hello?

190
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:18,957
- Whoa!
- Sorry.

191
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,553
That official FBI business?

192
00:27:39,801 --> 00:27:40,916
What?

193
00:27:41,001 --> 00:27:44,390
Bet the Bureau's accusing you
of the same thing in Dallas.

194
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,757
Standing around holding your yank
while bombs are exploding.

195
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:54,709
Do I know you?

196
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,187
No, but I've been watching your career
for a good while.

197
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:01,985
Back when you were
a promising young agent. Before that.

198
00:28:03,196 --> 00:28:06,153
- You come out here for a reason?
- Yeah...

199
00:28:06,235 --> 00:28:08,226
I did.

200
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:11,784
My name is Kurtzweil.

201
00:28:11,874 --> 00:28:13,909
Dr Alvin Kurtzweil.

202
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:18,270
- Am I supposed to know that name?
- Old friend of your father's.

203
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:22,102
At the State Department
we were fellow travelers.

204
00:28:22,191 --> 00:28:26,104
But his disenchantment outlasted mine.

205
00:28:35,268 --> 00:28:37,259
How'd you find me?

206
00:28:37,868 --> 00:28:41,701
I heard you come in here.
I figured you'd need a drink tonight.

207
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:46,302
- You a reporter?
- A doctor, which I mentioned. OB-GYN.

208
00:28:46,386 --> 00:28:48,694
You got something to tell me, say it.

209
00:28:48,785 --> 00:28:52,095
There's something you don't know
about the bombing in Dallas.

210
00:28:52,184 --> 00:28:53,412
What's that?

211
00:28:53,504 --> 00:28:57,576
SAC Darius Michaud never tried
or intended to defuse that bomb.

212
00:28:57,663 --> 00:29:00,336
He just let it explode in his face, huh?

213
00:29:00,423 --> 00:29:04,381
What is no-one asking? Why that building?
Why not the Federal Building?

214
00:29:04,462 --> 00:29:06,577
It was too well guarded.

215
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,050
They bombed the other building...

216
00:29:09,141 --> 00:29:12,052
...because it did have Federal officers there.

217
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,778
The Federal Emergency
Management Agency...

218
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:18,168
...had a quarantine office there,
where the bodies were found.

219
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:22,092
That's the thing you didn't know.
The thing you'd never think to check.

220
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:24,645
Those people were already dead.

221
00:29:26,497 --> 00:29:28,487
Before the bomb went off?

222
00:29:28,576 --> 00:29:30,328
That's what I'm saying.

223
00:29:32,655 --> 00:29:34,850
Darius Michaud was a 22-year veteran...

224
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:39,609
Michaud was a patriot. The people he was
loyal to know their way around Dallas.

225
00:29:39,693 --> 00:29:44,049
They blew that building to hide something.
Something they couldn't predict.

226
00:29:44,132 --> 00:29:47,886
They blew up a building
just to hide the bodies of those firemen?

227
00:29:47,972 --> 00:29:49,848
And one little boy.

228
00:29:51,051 --> 00:29:53,041
I think you're full of shit.

229
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,240
Do you?

230
00:30:00,569 --> 00:30:03,082
Arlington, please.

231
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:19,483
Actually, no, let's go to Georgetown.

232
00:30:20,604 --> 00:30:22,992
Let's go to Georgetown.

233
00:30:49,797 --> 00:30:52,470
- I woke you. Did I wake you?
- No.

234
00:30:52,557 --> 00:30:54,353
Why not? It's 3am.

235
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,427
Are you drunk?

236
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:00,547
L-I was until about 20 minutes ago, yeah.

237
00:31:00,635 --> 00:31:03,944
Was that before or after
you decided to come here?

238
00:31:04,034 --> 00:31:05,706
What are you implying?

239
00:31:07,153 --> 00:31:09,428
- Go home, Mulder.
- No, get dressed.

240
00:31:09,513 --> 00:31:11,946
- It's late.
- Get dressed.

241
00:31:12,032 --> 00:31:16,309
- What are you doing?
- Get dressed and I'll explain on the way.

242
00:33:01,127 --> 00:33:03,196
Got something to show me?

243
00:33:10,165 --> 00:33:14,555
We brought the atmosphere back down
to freezing, to control the development...

244
00:33:14,644 --> 00:33:17,555
...which is like nothing we've ever seen.

245
00:33:17,643 --> 00:33:20,634
- Brought on by what?
- Heat, I think.

246
00:33:20,722 --> 00:33:23,156
The coincident invasion of a host...

247
00:33:23,242 --> 00:33:25,357
...the fireman...

248
00:33:25,441 --> 00:33:30,833
...and an environment that raised
his body temperature above 98.6.

249
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:41,308
This man's still alive.

250
00:33:41,397 --> 00:33:44,070
Technically... and biologically.

251
00:33:44,157 --> 00:33:46,386
But... he'll never recover.

252
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:51,514
How can this be?

253
00:33:51,595 --> 00:33:57,464
The developing organism is using
his life energy, digesting bone and tissue.

254
00:33:58,473 --> 00:34:01,067
We've just... slowed the process.

255
00:34:03,552 --> 00:34:06,907
Shall we destroy this one, too?
Before it gestates?

256
00:34:06,991 --> 00:34:09,551
Uh, no. No.

257
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:12,827
We need to try our vaccine on it.

258
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:15,140
And if it's unsuccessful?

259
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:18,505
Burn it. Like the others.

260
00:34:40,864 --> 00:34:44,139
- ID and floor you're visiting.
- The morgue.

261
00:34:45,503 --> 00:34:47,891
That area's currently off limits.

262
00:34:47,982 --> 00:34:50,211
- On whose orders?
- General McAddie.

263
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:54,340
We were woken at 3am and told
to get down here immediately.

264
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,297
I don't know about that.

265
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,098
- Call General McAddie.
- I don't have the number.

266
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:00,612
Call the switchboard.

267
00:35:03,498 --> 00:35:05,090
You don't know their number?

268
00:35:05,178 --> 00:35:10,046
- I'll call my CO.
- We don't have time for you to dick around.

269
00:35:10,137 --> 00:35:12,730
Our order came from McAddie. Call him.

270
00:35:12,816 --> 00:35:17,206
We'll conduct our business
while you confirm authorization.

271
00:35:18,935 --> 00:35:22,643
Why don't you head on down,
and I'll confirm authorization.

272
00:35:22,734 --> 00:35:24,372
Thank you.

273
00:35:24,454 --> 00:35:28,731
Why is the morgue suddenly off limits
on the orders of the general?

274
00:35:28,852 --> 00:35:32,447
This is one of the firemen
who died in Dallas?

275
00:35:32,532 --> 00:35:34,408
According to the toe tag.

276
00:35:34,491 --> 00:35:38,005
- And you're looking for...?
- Cause of death.

277
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:41,560
I can tell you that
without even looking at him.

278
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:46,676
"Concussive organ failure due to
exposure to source and flying debris."

279
00:35:46,768 --> 00:35:50,044
Mulder, this man's already been autopsied.

280
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:57,316
Does this fit the description
you just read me?

281
00:36:01,885 --> 00:36:05,399
- Oh, my God! This man's tissue...
- It's like jelly.

282
00:36:07,883 --> 00:36:12,114
There's been some kind
of cellular breakdown.

283
00:36:15,962 --> 00:36:18,759
God, it's completely edematous!

284
00:36:20,521 --> 00:36:24,638
There's been no autopsy performed.
No Y-incision...

285
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:27,151
...no internal exam.

286
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:30,753
So the cause of death on that report is false?

287
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:33,590
This man didn't die from an explosion?

288
00:36:33,677 --> 00:36:39,034
I can't tell you what killed this man.
I'm not sure anybody else could, either.

289
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:48,867
Mulder, you knew this man
didn't die at the bomb site.

290
00:36:48,954 --> 00:36:52,548
- I'd been told as much.
- You're saying this is a cover-up?

291
00:36:52,633 --> 00:36:54,032
Of what?

292
00:36:54,113 --> 00:36:58,503
I don't know. But I've a hunch it won't be
anything that can be categorized.

293
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:05,029
Mulder, this is gonna take time. Somebody
is gonna figure out we shouldn't be here.

294
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:10,137
We are being blamed for this man's death.
I want to know what he died of. Don't you?

295
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,458
That's it, up here.

296
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:52,097
- Excuse me? Can I help you?
- Is this Dr Kurtzweil's residence?

297
00:37:54,059 --> 00:37:58,256
- You have business with him?
- Yeah, I'm looking for him.

298
00:37:58,338 --> 00:38:00,407
Looking for him for what?

299
00:38:02,057 --> 00:38:06,572
The Feds are lookin' for him, too.
Nice business he's got, huh?

300
00:38:06,656 --> 00:38:08,566
What's that?

301
00:38:08,655 --> 00:38:12,648
Selling naked pictures of little kids
on his computer.

302
00:38:17,093 --> 00:38:20,802
You looking for him
for some other reason?

303
00:38:20,973 --> 00:38:24,885
Yeah. I had an appointment
for a pelvic examination.

304
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,242
- You want a call if we find this Kurtzweil?
- Don't bother.

305
00:38:56,844 --> 00:39:00,041
See this crap?
Somebody knows I'm talking to you.

306
00:39:00,124 --> 00:39:02,353
Not according to the men in blue.

307
00:39:02,443 --> 00:39:05,798
Is it kiddie porn again?
Sexual battery of a patient?

308
00:39:05,882 --> 00:39:10,272
- They wanna discredit you. Why?
- Because I know too much about the truth.

309
00:39:10,361 --> 00:39:13,272
That end-of-the-world garbage you write?

310
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,112
You know my work?

311
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,554
- I was right about Dallas.
- How?

312
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:22,106
Do you know of the Hanta virus?

313
00:39:22,198 --> 00:39:27,988
Yeah. A deadly virus spread by field mice
several years ago.

314
00:39:28,077 --> 00:39:32,308
The newspaper says FEMA was called out
to manage an outbreak.

315
00:39:32,396 --> 00:39:37,833
Do you know what the Federal Emergency
Management Agency's real power is?

316
00:39:37,915 --> 00:39:43,147
It can suspend constitutional government
upon declaration of a national emergency.

317
00:39:43,234 --> 00:39:45,189
Think about that.

318
00:39:45,273 --> 00:39:51,745
What is such a powerful agency doing
managing a small viral outbreak in Texas?

319
00:39:51,951 --> 00:39:57,388
- You saying it wasn't a small outbreak?
- No. I'm saying it wasn't the Hanta virus.

320
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,142
Well, what was it?

321
00:40:04,749 --> 00:40:06,739
What was it?

322
00:40:08,908 --> 00:40:14,424
Years ago, your father and I were recruited
for a project. Biological warfare. A virus.

323
00:40:14,506 --> 00:40:16,337
What killed those men?

324
00:40:16,426 --> 00:40:21,215
Something l won't even write about.
We have no context for what it is.

325
00:40:21,305 --> 00:40:25,183
Or any appreciation of the scale
at which it will be unleashed.

326
00:40:25,264 --> 00:40:27,254
A plague?

327
00:40:28,663 --> 00:40:30,732
The plague to end all plagues.

328
00:40:30,822 --> 00:40:33,416
A silent weapon for a quiet war.

329
00:40:33,502 --> 00:40:39,019
The systematic release of an indiscriminate
organism for which there is no cure.

330
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:42,172
They've been working on this for 50 years.

331
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:48,288
While the rest of the world fought Commies,
these men were negotiating an Armageddon.

332
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:50,608
Negotiating with whom?

333
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,767
I think you know.

334
00:40:52,857 --> 00:40:58,613
The timetable has been set. It'll happen
on a holiday when people are travelling.

335
00:40:58,696 --> 00:41:03,928
A state of emergency will be declared.
Government will come under the power...

336
00:41:04,015 --> 00:41:07,051
...of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.

337
00:41:07,894 --> 00:41:11,283
FEMA. The secret government.

338
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:14,723
They call me paranoid!

339
00:41:14,812 --> 00:41:18,281
Go back to Dallas, Agent Mulder, and dig.

340
00:41:19,251 --> 00:41:23,960
Or we'll find out along with the rest
of the country... when it's too late.

341
00:42:14,453 --> 00:42:16,171
Scully, it's me.

342
00:42:16,893 --> 00:42:19,326
- Yeah.
- Why are you whispering?

343
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,164
I can't talk right now.

344
00:42:21,252 --> 00:42:25,563
- What did you find?
- Evidence of a massive infection.

345
00:42:25,651 --> 00:42:29,006
- What kind of infection?
- I don’t know.

346
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:33,247
I'm gonna book a flight to Dallas.

347
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:35,047
I'll get you a ticket, too.

348
00:42:35,129 --> 00:42:37,562
- Mulder...
- I need your expertise.

349
00:42:37,648 --> 00:42:41,276
- It's my hearing tomorrow.
- I'll get you back in time.

350
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:43,437
Maybe with new evidence.

351
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:46,757
I can't!
I'm past the point of common sense here.

352
00:42:46,846 --> 00:42:50,724
It's not common sense. It's...

353
00:42:51,365 --> 00:42:54,595
Are you there? Scul...

354
00:42:54,684 --> 00:42:56,675
Scully?

355
00:43:27,317 --> 00:43:29,989
You're looking for a needle in a haystack.

356
00:43:30,076 --> 00:43:33,909
There was so much devastation,
we haven't put much together yet.

357
00:43:33,995 --> 00:43:38,226
I'm looking for anything unusual.
Maybe something from the FEMA offices...

358
00:43:38,314 --> 00:43:42,864
...where the bodies were found.
- We sent those remains off to Washington.

359
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:46,388
Anything that you haven't sent off yet?

360
00:43:46,472 --> 00:43:52,660
Some bone fragments FEMA recovered
from an archaeological site outta town.

361
00:43:52,751 --> 00:43:55,981
- Have you examined them?
- No. They're just fossils.

362
00:43:58,829 --> 00:44:02,343
I'd like you to let this person
take a look at them.

363
00:44:05,508 --> 00:44:07,657
Just let me get them.

364
00:44:11,266 --> 00:44:14,576
- You said you weren't coming.
- I wasn't planning to.

365
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:19,977
But I got a better look at the samples
I took from the fireman.

366
00:44:20,064 --> 00:44:21,736
And what did you find?

367
00:44:21,824 --> 00:44:26,499
Something I couldn't show to anybody else
without causing attention.

368
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:34,810
But what those men were infected with
contains a protein coat I've never seen before.

369
00:44:34,901 --> 00:44:36,538
What it did to them, it did very fast.

370
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,612
- How was it contracted?
- I don't know.

371
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,772
But it could be a serious health threat.

372
00:44:45,418 --> 00:44:50,252
These fossils weren't near the blast centre
so they won't tell you much.

373
00:44:50,337 --> 00:44:53,329
Right. Why don't you check this out?

374
00:45:12,452 --> 00:45:17,206
- Where were these found?
- I'll show you right on the map.

375
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:54,115
I want all of these settings checked.

376
00:45:54,202 --> 00:45:59,594
I want a steady minus two degrees Celsius
throughout the transfer of the body...

377
00:45:59,681 --> 00:46:01,990
...after I've administered the vaccine.

378
00:46:36,433 --> 00:46:38,388
- It's gone!
- It's what?

379
00:46:38,472 --> 00:46:41,781
It's left the body. I think it's gestated.

380
00:46:43,431 --> 00:46:46,786
- What's the matter?
- Wait.

381
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,863
I can see it.

382
00:46:57,828 --> 00:46:59,021
Oh...

383
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:01,302
Jesus, Lord...

384
00:47:03,506 --> 00:47:05,781
- You see it?
- Yeah.

385
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:08,220
So much for little green men!

386
00:47:10,225 --> 00:47:13,534
I need you down here.

387
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:16,159
Help... I need help.

388
00:48:22,408 --> 00:48:24,319
What are you doing?

389
00:48:25,887 --> 00:48:27,161
What are you doing!

390
00:48:34,405 --> 00:48:36,965
Oh, my God!

391
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:05,949
Sir, you have a call.

392
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:18,990
Yes?

393
00:49:19,075 --> 00:49:22,430
We have a situation.
The members are assembling.

394
00:49:22,514 --> 00:49:23,708
Is it an emergency?

395
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:28,662
Yes. A meeting has been set,
tonight in London.

396
00:49:28,753 --> 00:49:30,470
Who called it?

397
00:49:30,552 --> 00:49:34,464
Strughold. He just got on a plane in Tunis.

398
00:50:05,184 --> 00:50:09,335
- Has Strughold arrived?
- Yes. They're in the library, sir.

399
00:50:20,741 --> 00:50:25,859
We were worried. Some of us have travelled
so far, and you are the last to arrive.

400
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:29,215
I'm sorry. My grandson broke his leg.

401
00:50:29,299 --> 00:50:36,408
While we've been waiting, we've seen
surveillance tapes that raise more concerns.

402
00:50:36,497 --> 00:50:38,805
More concerns than what?

403
00:50:38,896 --> 00:50:42,935
We have been forced to reassess
our role in colonization...

404
00:50:43,016 --> 00:50:47,372
...by recently presented facts of biology.

405
00:50:47,454 --> 00:50:49,172
The virus has mutated.

406
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:51,210
Into what?

407
00:50:51,294 --> 00:50:55,081
A new extraterrestrial biological entity.

408
00:50:56,452 --> 00:50:58,408
My God...

409
00:50:58,492 --> 00:51:03,724
The geometry of mass infection means
we must re-evaluate their colonization.

410
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:09,008
This isn't colonization.
This is spontaneous repopulation.

411
00:51:10,529 --> 00:51:12,121
All our work...

412
00:51:12,209 --> 00:51:17,157
If it's true, they've been using us all along.
We've been laboring under a lie.

413
00:51:17,248 --> 00:51:21,126
- It could be an isolated case.
- How can we know?

414
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:25,040
We're going to tell them
what we've learned...

415
00:51:25,126 --> 00:51:29,403
...by turning over a body
infected with the gestating organism.

416
00:51:29,485 --> 00:51:33,272
In hope of what?
Learning that it's true?

417
00:51:33,364 --> 00:51:37,914
That we are nothing but digestives
for the creation of a new race of aliens?

418
00:51:38,003 --> 00:51:41,039
By co-operating
we hasten our own demise.

419
00:51:41,122 --> 00:51:44,397
It's the only chance of saving ourselves.

420
00:51:44,481 --> 00:51:47,553
They still need us to make their preparations.

421
00:51:47,641 --> 00:51:52,838
We'll continue to use them as they do us,
if only to get more time to work...

422
00:51:52,919 --> 00:51:54,637
...on our vaccine.

423
00:51:54,719 --> 00:52:00,588
My lateness might as well have been
absence. A course has already been taken.

424
00:52:00,678 --> 00:52:02,827
There are complications.

425
00:52:02,917 --> 00:52:07,068
Mulder saw one of the infected bodies
we destroyed in Dallas.

426
00:52:07,156 --> 00:52:09,669
He's there now. Someone tipped him.

427
00:52:09,755 --> 00:52:10,744
Who?

428
00:52:12,635 --> 00:52:17,469
- Kurtzweil, we think.
- No-one believes Kurtzweil. Or his books.

429
00:52:17,554 --> 00:52:19,384
He's a crank.

430
00:52:19,473 --> 00:52:21,065
Mulder believes him.

431
00:52:21,153 --> 00:52:25,782
- Then Kurtzweil must be removed.
- As must Mulder.

432
00:52:25,872 --> 00:52:31,581
Kill Mulder... we take the risk
of turning one man's quest into a crusade.

433
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:34,821
Then take away
what he holds most valuable.

434
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:38,106
That with which he can't live without.

435
00:52:42,068 --> 00:52:47,187
I don't see any evidence of an archaeological
or any other kind of a dig site.

436
00:52:47,267 --> 00:52:49,985
This is where he marked on the map.

437
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:55,093
You're sure those fossils were infected
with the same virus you saw at the morgue?

438
00:52:55,185 --> 00:53:00,383
Both sets of bones were porous.
As if the virus were decomposing it.

439
00:53:00,464 --> 00:53:03,136
- And you've never seen that virus before?
- No.

440
00:53:06,142 --> 00:53:08,133
Look at that.

441
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:25,214
- That look like new grass to you?
- Pretty green for this climate.

442
00:53:29,697 --> 00:53:33,291
Ground's dry about an inch down.
This was laid recently.

443
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,287
The equipment's brand-new, too.

444
00:53:35,376 --> 00:53:39,334
No irrigation system.
Somebody's covering their tracks.

445
00:53:46,453 --> 00:53:47,488
Hey!

446
00:53:48,812 --> 00:53:49,847
Hey!

447
00:53:50,932 --> 00:53:53,206
You boys live around here?

448
00:53:53,291 --> 00:53:54,280
Yeah.

449
00:53:54,371 --> 00:53:56,521
Seen anybody digging over there?

450
00:53:56,611 --> 00:53:58,805
We're not supposed to say.

451
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:01,687
- Who told you that?
- Nobody.

452
00:54:01,769 --> 00:54:04,920
Same nobody that built that playground?

453
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:08,842
Nobody buy you those new bikes, too?

454
00:54:08,928 --> 00:54:12,124
- You'd better tell us.
- We don't even know you.

455
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,640
We're FBI agents.

456
00:54:13,727 --> 00:54:15,398
You're not FBI agents.

457
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:19,763
- How do you know?
- Cos y'all look like door-to-door salesmen.

458
00:54:23,644 --> 00:54:25,839
Hey, you wanna buy a badge?

459
00:54:26,884 --> 00:54:28,760
They left an hour ago.

460
00:54:28,843 --> 00:54:30,879
Going that way.

461
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,908
Unmarked tanker trucks.

462
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:49,149
What do archaeologists
haul out in tanker trucks?

463
00:54:49,238 --> 00:54:51,911
- I don't know.
- Where are they going with it?

464
00:54:51,998 --> 00:54:55,512
That's the first question to answer
if we're gonna find them.

465
00:55:04,875 --> 00:55:06,307
What are my choices?

466
00:55:06,474 --> 00:55:10,864
- 100 miles of nothing in both directions.
- Which way do you think they went?

467
00:55:10,993 --> 00:55:13,143
You got two choices. One's wrong.

468
00:55:16,992 --> 00:55:19,903
- I think they went left.
- I think they went right.

469
00:55:37,027 --> 00:55:41,144
Five years together.
How many times have I been wrong?

470
00:55:41,226 --> 00:55:43,217
Never.

471
00:55:43,866 --> 00:55:45,537
Not driving, anyway.

472
00:56:29,335 --> 00:56:32,883
- I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
- This is great. This is fitting.

473
00:56:32,974 --> 00:56:35,363
What?

474
00:56:35,454 --> 00:56:42,244
I have to be in Washington DC in 11 hours
for a hearing concerning my career.

475
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:47,086
And I'm in the middle of nowhere,
chasing phantom tanker trucks.

476
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:49,162
We're chasing evidence.

477
00:56:49,251 --> 00:56:50,399
Of what?

478
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:55,324
That bomb went off to hide something:
Bodies infected with a virus you detected.

479
00:56:55,409 --> 00:57:00,607
They haul oil in tanker trucks. They haul gas
in tanker trucks. They do not haul viruses.

480
00:57:00,688 --> 00:57:04,441
Well, they may be hauling a virus
in these tanker trucks.

481
00:57:04,527 --> 00:57:06,518
What do you mean? Mulder?

482
00:57:06,607 --> 00:57:08,915
What are you not telling me?

483
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:12,395
Mulder!

484
00:57:14,245 --> 00:57:16,678
The virus may be extraterrestrial.

485
00:57:20,723 --> 00:57:23,032
I don't...

486
00:57:23,123 --> 00:57:25,556
Mulder, I don't...

487
00:58:49,423 --> 00:58:53,017
- What do you think they are?
- I have no idea.

488
00:59:33,652 --> 00:59:35,244
This is weird, Mulder.

489
00:59:35,892 --> 00:59:37,211
Very weird.

490
00:59:37,292 --> 00:59:41,079
Why would anyone grow corn
in the middle of the desert?

491
00:59:41,171 --> 00:59:44,446
Those could be giant Jiffy Pop poppers.

492
01:00:52,554 --> 01:00:54,829
It's cool in here.

493
01:00:55,074 --> 01:00:57,792
The temperature's being regulated.

494
01:00:57,873 --> 01:00:59,863
For the purpose of what?

495
01:00:59,952 --> 01:01:04,741
I think we're on top of a larger structure.
This is some kind of a venting system.

496
01:01:04,831 --> 01:01:06,787
Do you hear something?

497
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:15,501
I hear a humming. Like electricity.

498
01:01:16,749 --> 01:01:18,101
High voltage, maybe.

499
01:01:18,188 --> 01:01:20,019
Maybe.

500
01:01:25,387 --> 01:01:27,377
Maybe not.

501
01:01:34,504 --> 01:01:35,937
Scully...

502
01:01:36,024 --> 01:01:38,492
- Yeah?
- Run!

503
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:52,810
Scully!

504
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,334
I can't see!

505
01:01:57,779 --> 01:01:59,929
Give me your hand!

506
01:02:08,896 --> 01:02:12,525
- Did you get stung?
- I don't think so.

507
01:03:23,959 --> 01:03:25,233
Talk to me, Scully!

508
01:03:25,319 --> 01:03:27,786
Scully!

509
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:30,436
Damn it! Scully!

510
01:03:36,756 --> 01:03:38,269
Scully!

511
01:03:38,956 --> 01:03:40,024
Scully!

512
01:03:40,955 --> 01:03:42,547
Talk to me, Scully!

513
01:03:42,635 --> 01:03:43,953
Mulder!

514
01:03:48,153 --> 01:03:49,268
Scully!

515
01:03:50,113 --> 01:03:51,626
Mulder!

516
01:03:51,713 --> 01:03:53,225
Can you hear me?

517
01:03:53,312 --> 01:03:53,983
Mulder...

518
01:04:05,869 --> 01:04:07,666
Scully!

519
01:04:11,108 --> 01:04:12,302
Scully!

520
01:04:12,708 --> 01:04:13,538
Scully!

521
01:04:14,947 --> 01:04:15,902
Mulder!

522
01:04:15,987 --> 01:04:16,942
Scully!

523
01:04:17,027 --> 01:04:18,778
Scully, talk to me!

524
01:04:18,866 --> 01:04:20,060
Mulder...

525
01:04:26,265 --> 01:04:27,413
Where'd they go?

526
01:04:30,944 --> 01:04:32,934
Come on!

527
01:04:58,377 --> 01:04:59,605
She's coming in.

528
01:05:08,135 --> 01:05:09,807
Special Agent Scully.

529
01:05:09,894 --> 01:05:12,010
I apologize for making you wait.

530
01:05:12,094 --> 01:05:14,402
I have new evidence.

531
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:16,051
Evidence of what?

532
01:05:18,213 --> 01:05:21,602
These are fossilized bone fragments...

533
01:05:22,012 --> 01:05:26,368
...that were gathered
at the bomb site in Dallas.

534
01:05:26,451 --> 01:05:29,601
- You've been back to Dallas?
- Yes.

535
01:05:39,048 --> 01:05:42,437
- You found something.
- In Texas, some kind of experiment.

536
01:05:42,527 --> 01:05:44,881
Tankers carrying something they excavated.

537
01:05:44,966 --> 01:05:49,243
- What?
- I'm not sure. A virus, I think.

538
01:05:49,325 --> 01:05:55,399
I also have reason to believe that there may
have been involvement by SAC Michaud.

539
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:59,999
Those are very serious allegations,
Agent Scully.

540
01:06:00,083 --> 01:06:02,312
Yes, I know.

541
01:06:02,402 --> 01:06:05,280
- You saw this experiment?
- Yeah. We were chased off.

542
01:06:05,362 --> 01:06:09,240
- What did it look like?
- There were bees, corn crops.

543
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:14,514
And you have conclusive evidence
to tie your claim to the crime?

544
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:23,676
Not completely conclusive. We're working
towards gathering that evidence.

545
01:06:23,757 --> 01:06:25,156
Working with?

546
01:06:27,916 --> 01:06:29,349
With Agent Mulder.

547
01:06:29,436 --> 01:06:33,269
- What are they?
- What do you think?

548
01:06:33,355 --> 01:06:38,508
Transportation system. Transgenic crops.
The pollen altered to carry a virus.

549
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:39,913
That's my guess.

550
01:06:42,713 --> 01:06:43,589
Guess?

551
01:06:43,713 --> 01:06:47,261
What do you mean?
Hey! You told me you had answers.

552
01:06:47,352 --> 01:06:49,581
Yeah, but I don't have 'me all.

553
01:06:49,671 --> 01:06:53,583
- You didn't know my father.
- He and I were old friends.

554
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:57,299
You've used me
to gather information for your books!

555
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:59,266
Lower your voice!

556
01:07:02,588 --> 01:07:04,226
Kurtzweil!

557
01:07:04,308 --> 01:07:10,416
You'd be shit out of luck if it wasn't for me.
I put my ass on the line for you.

558
01:07:10,507 --> 01:07:13,703
I just got chased
by two black helicopters!

559
01:07:13,786 --> 01:07:17,095
And why do you think
you're here talking to me?

560
01:07:17,185 --> 01:07:19,379
These people don't make mistakes.

561
01:08:13,492 --> 01:08:15,482
What's wrong?

562
01:08:16,811 --> 01:08:20,598
Salt Lake City, Utah.
Transfer effective immediately.

563
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:24,807
I already gave Skinner
my letter of resignation.

564
01:08:24,889 --> 01:08:26,720
You can't quit now.

565
01:08:26,809 --> 01:08:31,484
I can, Mulder. I debated
whether to tell you in person...

566
01:08:31,648 --> 01:08:33,922
We're on the verge here!

567
01:08:34,007 --> 01:08:37,715
You're on the verge.
Please don't do this to me.

568
01:08:37,806 --> 01:08:41,559
After all you've seen,
you can just walk away?

569
01:08:41,645 --> 01:08:44,079
I have. I did. It's done.

570
01:08:44,165 --> 01:08:47,679
- I need you on this...
- You don't need me.

571
01:08:48,044 --> 01:08:51,001
You never have.
I've just held you back.

572
01:08:55,162 --> 01:08:57,153
I gotta go.

573
01:09:00,641 --> 01:09:05,270
If you wanna tell yourself that, you can.
But you're wrong.

574
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,748
Why did they assign me to you?

575
01:09:07,879 --> 01:09:10,552
To debunk your work.
To shut you down.

576
01:09:10,639 --> 01:09:12,276
But you saved me!

577
01:09:12,358 --> 01:09:15,952
As frustrating as it's been sometimes...

578
01:09:16,037 --> 01:09:20,871
...your strict rationalism and science
have saved me a thousand times over.

579
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:22,947
You kept me honest.

580
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:28,943
You made me a whole person.
I owe you everything.

581
01:09:30,234 --> 01:09:32,828
Scully, you owe me nothing.

582
01:09:37,272 --> 01:09:40,264
I don't know if I wanna do this alone.

583
01:09:42,831 --> 01:09:44,822
I don't even know if I can.

584
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:50,464
And if I quit now, they win.

585
01:10:45,297 --> 01:10:46,695
Ow! Jesus!

586
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:47,686
I'm sorry.

587
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:50,165
No... Something stung me.

588
01:10:55,854 --> 01:10:58,322
Must've gotten in your shirt.

589
01:10:59,094 --> 01:11:00,128
Mulder...

590
01:11:01,733 --> 01:11:03,291
...something's wrong.

591
01:11:03,612 --> 01:11:04,761
What?

592
01:11:04,852 --> 01:11:10,005
- I'm having lancinating pain in my chest.
- What?

593
01:11:10,531 --> 01:11:11,646
Scully!

594
01:11:11,731 --> 01:11:17,998
My motor functions are being affected.
My... pulse is thready.

595
01:11:18,129 --> 01:11:22,280
I have a funny taste in the back of my throat.

596
01:11:22,368 --> 01:11:26,076
- It must be anaphylactic shock.
- I have no allergy...

597
01:11:34,045 --> 01:11:37,879
This is Special Agent Fox Mulder.
I have an agent down!

598
01:11:38,644 --> 01:11:41,761
Can you hear me?
Can you say your name?

599
01:11:41,844 --> 01:11:47,917
She has constriction in the throat.
Let's get her in the van right away!

600
01:11:48,722 --> 01:11:53,272
She said she had a funny taste in her throat.
But she has no allergy to bee stings.

601
01:11:53,361 --> 01:11:55,999
The bee that stung her
might have been carrying a virus.

602
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:00,709
- Get on the radio. Tell them...
- Tell them it may have been carrying a virus!

603
01:12:00,799 --> 01:12:03,632
I wanna go with her.
What hospital? I...

604
01:12:04,318 --> 01:12:06,388
What hospital are you taking her to?

605
01:13:48,454 --> 01:13:51,093
- What are you doing?
- Reading his chart.

606
01:13:51,174 --> 01:13:53,687
- Put it down.
- When I'm ready.

607
01:13:53,773 --> 01:13:57,082
- I think he's coming out of it.
- He's coming to.

608
01:13:58,612 --> 01:14:00,250
Hey, Mulder.

609
01:14:00,331 --> 01:14:01,844
Mulder?

610
01:14:03,891 --> 01:14:05,482
Oh, my God...

611
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:11,887
Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow, Toto.

612
01:14:15,608 --> 01:14:17,563
What am I doin' here?

613
01:14:17,647 --> 01:14:21,924
- A bullet grazed your temporal plate.
- 3cms left and we'd be playing harps.

614
01:14:22,006 --> 01:14:24,474
You've been unconscious since you got here.

615
01:14:24,926 --> 01:14:26,041
Where's Scully?

616
01:14:26,126 --> 01:14:29,515
Your 911 call must have been intercepted.

617
01:14:29,765 --> 01:14:33,962
Scully had a reaction
to a honeybee we found in your hall.

618
01:14:34,044 --> 01:14:37,592
- I gotta get to her.
- You're staying right here.

619
01:14:37,683 --> 01:14:39,638
This goes back to Dallas.

620
01:14:39,722 --> 01:14:43,237
- Where is she? I'll find her.
- I don't know where she is.

621
01:14:43,322 --> 01:14:49,077
You leave here unprotected, how far
will you get? How far will they let you get?

622
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:51,196
What can we do?

623
01:14:53,159 --> 01:14:54,956
You can strip Byers naked.

624
01:14:55,039 --> 01:14:56,188
What?

625
01:14:56,279 --> 01:14:58,872
I need your clothes.

626
01:15:26,791 --> 01:15:28,782
It's Mulder.

627
01:16:01,383 --> 01:16:04,136
Dr Kurtzweil? Dr Alvin Kurtzweil.

628
01:16:54,211 --> 01:16:55,564
Mr Mulder.

629
01:16:58,010 --> 01:17:00,444
What happened to Kurtzweil?

630
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:03,248
He's come and gone.

631
01:17:03,329 --> 01:17:05,001
Where's Scully?

632
01:17:05,089 --> 01:17:09,957
The location of Agent Scully
and the means to save her life.

633
01:17:10,047 --> 01:17:11,639
Please.

634
01:17:49,678 --> 01:17:51,316
What is it?

635
01:17:51,398 --> 01:17:55,276
A weak vaccine against the virus
she's been infected with.

636
01:17:55,357 --> 01:17:58,189
It must be administered within 96 hours.

637
01:17:58,276 --> 01:18:01,109
That leaves you little time to get there.

638
01:18:03,475 --> 01:18:08,025
- You're lying.
- No. Though I can't prove it.

639
01:18:08,194 --> 01:18:11,742
The virus is extraterrestrial.
We know little about it...

640
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:15,108
...except that it was
the original inhabitant of Earth.

641
01:18:16,752 --> 01:18:18,310
- A virus?
- What is a virus...

642
01:18:18,392 --> 01:18:22,384
...but a colonizing force
that cannot be defeated?

643
01:18:22,471 --> 01:18:27,225
Living in a cave, underground,
until it mutates and attacks.

644
01:18:27,709 --> 01:18:30,906
This is what you've been
conspiring to conceal?

645
01:18:30,989 --> 01:18:34,697
- A disease?
- No, you've got it all backwards.

646
01:18:34,788 --> 01:18:39,941
AIDS, the Ebola virus,
on an evolutionary scale, they're newborns.

647
01:18:40,027 --> 01:18:43,985
This virus walked the planet
long before the dinosaurs.

648
01:18:44,066 --> 01:18:45,054
Walked?

649
01:18:45,145 --> 01:18:51,538
Your aliens, your little green men,
arrived here millions of years ago.

650
01:18:51,624 --> 01:18:55,502
Those that didn't leave
have been lying dormant...

651
01:18:55,583 --> 01:18:58,733
...in the form of an evolved pathogen...

652
01:18:58,822 --> 01:19:05,738
...waiting to be reconstituted by the alien race
when it comes to colonize the planet...

653
01:19:05,821 --> 01:19:07,458
...using us as hosts.

654
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:11,737
Against this, we have no defense.
Nothing but a weak vaccine.

655
01:19:11,819 --> 01:19:14,492
Do you see why it was kept secret?

656
01:19:14,659 --> 01:19:19,651
Why even men like your father
could not let the truth be known?

657
01:19:19,737 --> 01:19:25,413
Until Dallas, we believed the virus would
simply control us. Make us a slave race.

658
01:19:28,335 --> 01:19:33,169
Imagine our surprise
when they began to gestate.

659
01:19:33,294 --> 01:19:36,922
My group has been working
with the alien colonists...

660
01:19:37,013 --> 01:19:41,483
...facilitating programes
to give us access to the virus...

661
01:19:41,572 --> 01:19:44,040
...in the hope of developing a cure.

662
01:19:45,731 --> 01:19:47,323
To save your own asses.

663
01:19:47,411 --> 01:19:51,961
Survival is the ultimate ideology.
Your father wisely refused to believe this.

664
01:19:52,050 --> 01:19:55,121
But he sacrificed my sister.

665
01:19:55,209 --> 01:20:01,283
With no vaccine, the only true survivors of
the viral holocaust will be those immune to it.

666
01:20:01,368 --> 01:20:07,965
Human alien clones. He allowed your sister
to be abducted, for one reason.

667
01:20:10,846 --> 01:20:12,836
So she would survive.

668
01:20:14,525 --> 01:20:16,276
As a genetic hybrid.

669
01:20:16,364 --> 01:20:19,833
Your father chose hope over selfishness.

670
01:20:20,043 --> 01:20:23,718
Hope in the only future he had, his children.

671
01:20:23,803 --> 01:20:26,714
He hoped you would uncover the truth.

672
01:20:26,802 --> 01:20:30,350
That you would stop the project,
that you would fight the future.

673
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:40,597
- Why are you telling me this?
- For the sake of my own children.

674
01:20:40,679 --> 01:20:44,956
Once it's learned what I've told you,
my life will be over.

675
01:20:52,516 --> 01:20:54,471
Where's Dr Kurtzweil?

676
01:20:58,515 --> 01:21:00,903
I'd like to get out of the car now.

677
01:21:02,394 --> 01:21:03,348
Stop the car!

678
01:21:05,353 --> 01:21:06,866
Driver...

679
01:21:26,788 --> 01:21:32,623
The men I work with will strongly protect
their stake in the inevitable future.

680
01:21:34,106 --> 01:21:39,463
I was ordered to kill Dr Kurtzweil.
As I was ordered to kill you.

681
01:21:44,784 --> 01:21:46,296
Trust no-one, Mr Mulder.

682
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:52,221
Get out of the car.

683
01:21:54,981 --> 01:21:57,541
Why? The upholstery's already ruined.

684
01:21:57,621 --> 01:21:59,212
Get out of the car!

685
01:22:09,138 --> 01:22:11,527
You have precious little time.

686
01:22:11,618 --> 01:22:17,009
What I've given you,
the alien colonists don't yet know exists.

687
01:22:17,096 --> 01:22:20,406
That vaccine is the only defense
against the virus.

688
01:22:20,496 --> 01:22:23,487
Introducing it into an alien environment...

689
01:22:23,575 --> 01:22:29,046
...may destroy the plans we have so
assiduously protected for the last 50 years.

690
01:22:29,134 --> 01:22:31,488
What do you mean, may?

691
01:22:31,573 --> 01:22:37,204
Find Agent Scully. Only then
will you realize the scope of the project.

692
01:22:38,371 --> 01:22:39,121
Go!

693
01:22:40,851 --> 01:22:42,841
Go now!

694
01:30:57,096 --> 01:30:58,084
Shit!

695
01:33:15,664 --> 01:33:19,338
Secure the station!
I want everyone else below.

696
01:33:19,423 --> 01:33:22,175
Arm yourselves.
We may have a breach.

697
01:33:36,539 --> 01:33:38,290
Let's go! Let's go!

698
01:34:18,409 --> 01:34:19,524
Scully?

699
01:34:33,366 --> 01:34:35,833
There's a contaminant in the system.

700
01:34:37,805 --> 01:34:40,193
Mulder has the vaccine.

701
01:34:59,639 --> 01:35:01,357
Breathe!

702
01:35:01,439 --> 01:35:03,031
Scully, can you breathe?

703
01:35:10,157 --> 01:35:11,636
Cold...

704
01:35:11,717 --> 01:35:14,276
- I'm cold...
- I'll get you out.

705
01:35:19,275 --> 01:35:22,550
Abandon your posts! Evacuate!

706
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:34,507
- What's happened?
- It's all going to hell!

707
01:35:34,591 --> 01:35:36,547
- What about Mulder?
- He won't make it.

708
01:37:16,128 --> 01:37:18,118
We gotta keep movin'.

709
01:37:18,407 --> 01:37:19,362
Come on!

710
01:37:19,447 --> 01:37:21,835
I can't.

711
01:37:21,926 --> 01:37:23,917
Yeah, you can.

712
01:37:40,962 --> 01:37:43,680
Scully, grab that vent.

713
01:37:46,041 --> 01:37:48,634
Scully, grab the vent!

714
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:52,069
Scully...

715
01:38:17,714 --> 01:38:18,782
Jeez, breathe!

716
01:38:25,032 --> 01:38:27,420
Breathe! Come on!

717
01:38:32,310 --> 01:38:34,301
Breathe in.

718
01:38:34,590 --> 01:38:37,308
Breathe in... Breathe!

719
01:38:38,749 --> 01:38:41,023
I had you big time.

720
01:38:56,585 --> 01:38:57,903
Pull!

721
01:38:57,984 --> 01:39:00,293
Come on, Scully! Pull!

722
01:39:02,983 --> 01:39:04,974
Mulder...

723
01:39:13,821 --> 01:39:15,173
Keep movin'!

724
01:39:20,659 --> 01:39:22,490
Go! Come on!

725
01:39:27,897 --> 01:39:30,252
Almost there. Keep going.

726
01:41:54,103 --> 01:41:56,059
You gotta see this.

727
01:41:56,143 --> 01:41:58,098
Scully!

728
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:41,152
In light of your report and narrative,
my official report is incomplete...

729
01:43:41,239 --> 01:43:44,275
...pending these new facts
I'm being asked to reconcile.

730
01:43:44,358 --> 01:43:50,306
Though it seems that a federal agent
may have been involved in the bombing...

731
01:43:50,396 --> 01:43:54,911
...the other events you've laid down
are too incredible on their own...

732
01:43:54,995 --> 01:43:59,624
...and, quite frankly, implausible.
- What is it you find incredible?

733
01:43:59,714 --> 01:44:01,386
Where should I start?

734
01:44:01,474 --> 01:44:06,422
So many of the events
described in your report defy belief.

735
01:44:06,513 --> 01:44:09,504
Antarctica is a long way from Dallas.

736
01:44:09,592 --> 01:44:15,109
I can't give the Attorney General a report
that alleges the links you've made here.

737
01:44:15,191 --> 01:44:20,422
Bees and corn crops
don't come under domestic terrorism.

738
01:44:21,029 --> 01:44:23,099
No, they don't.

739
01:44:24,189 --> 01:44:31,104
Your report doesn't show
any organization with an attributable motive.

740
01:44:31,427 --> 01:44:36,295
I realize your ordeal affected you,
but the holes in your account...

741
01:44:36,386 --> 01:44:40,981
...leave us with no choice
but to delete these references...

742
01:44:41,065 --> 01:44:48,458
...until hard evidence becomes available that
could cause us to pursue an investigation.

743
01:45:09,418 --> 01:45:16,652
I don't believe the FBI has an investigative
unit qualified to pursue the evidence in hand.

744
01:45:55,687 --> 01:45:59,838
There's an interesting work of fiction
on page 24.

745
01:45:59,926 --> 01:46:03,043
Mysteriously,
our names have been omitted.

746
01:46:03,765 --> 01:46:08,792
They're burying it. They're gonna
dig a new hole and cover it up.

747
01:46:08,884 --> 01:46:11,921
I told OPR everything I know.

748
01:46:12,004 --> 01:46:18,396
What I experienced, the virus, how it's spread
by the bees and transgenic crops.

749
01:46:18,482 --> 01:46:20,074
They'll never believe you.

750
01:46:20,162 --> 01:46:23,995
Not unless your story can be programmed, categorized
or easily referenced.

751
01:46:24,081 --> 01:46:26,310
- We'll go over their heads.
- No. No.

752
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:29,153
How many times
have we been here before?

753
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:32,037
Right here?
So close to the truth.

754
01:46:32,119 --> 01:46:35,428
And now,
to be back at the beginning with nothing!

755
01:46:35,518 --> 01:46:37,315
This is different.

756
01:46:37,398 --> 01:46:43,631
No, it isn't. You're right to want to quit. You
should get as far away from me as you can.

757
01:46:43,716 --> 01:46:46,912
I'm not gonna watch you die
because of a hollow cause of mine!

758
01:46:46,995 --> 01:46:49,668
Go be a doctor.

759
01:46:49,755 --> 01:46:52,473
Go be a doctor while you still can.

760
01:46:55,393 --> 01:46:57,543
I can't. I won't.

761
01:46:57,633 --> 01:47:02,148
I'll be a doctor,
but my work is here with you now.

762
01:47:02,232 --> 01:47:04,950
That virus that I was exposed to...

763
01:47:05,031 --> 01:47:10,741
...whatever it is, it has a cure.
You held it in your hand.

764
01:47:13,309 --> 01:47:15,982
How many other lives can we save?

765
01:47:18,908 --> 01:47:20,660
Look...

766
01:47:24,787 --> 01:47:28,222
...if I quit now, they win.

767
01:48:20,334 --> 01:48:23,928
You look hot.
Why have you travelled all this way?

768
01:48:24,013 --> 01:48:25,890
We have business to discuss.

769
01:48:25,972 --> 01:48:30,362
- You have regular channels.
- This involves Mulder.

770
01:48:30,691 --> 01:48:34,842
- That name! Again and again.
- He's seen more than he should.

771
01:48:34,930 --> 01:48:38,445
Of the whole, he has seen but pieces.

772
01:48:38,530 --> 01:48:42,408
He's determined now. Reinvested.

773
01:48:45,848 --> 01:48:47,838
He's but one man.

774
01:48:48,487 --> 01:48:51,524
One man alone cannot fight the future.

775
01:48:52,166 --> 01:48:54,157
Yesterday...

776
01:48:54,406 --> 01:48:56,396
...I received this.

777
01:48:57,305 --> 01:49:03,278
