00:00:13,686 --> 00:00:15,789
Now being admitted to the
practice of medicine

3
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:20,150
I solemnly pledge to consecrate my life
to the services of humanity

4
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,834
to help with the life of my patients
would be my first consideration

5
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:27,702
my colleagues would be my brothers

6
00:00:27,702 --> 00:00:33,348
I will not permit consideration of race,
religion,nationality or social standing

7
00:00:33,348 --> 00:00:36,857
to intervene between my duty
 and my patients

8
00:00:36,857 --> 00:00:39,768
whatever I shall see or hear
 of the lives of men

9
00:00:39,768 --> 00:00:43,580
which is not fit to be spoken
I will keep invariably secret

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,006
I will give no deadly medicine
 to anyone if asked

11
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:49,018
nor suggest any such countenance

12
00:00:49,018 --> 00:00:54,262
even under threat I will not use my
 knowledge contrary to laws of humanity

13
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:59,169
these promises I make freely
and upon my honor

Subtitles by Seglora

16
00:03:19,352 --> 00:03:20,183
Well Dr Coleman

17
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:21,809
-Did you have a good trip?
-Yes I did

18
00:03:21,809 --> 00:03:23,736
You remember Dr O'Donnell,our Chief Surgeon

19
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,318
Glad to see you her,Dr Coleman
we need you here

20
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:26,845
Thank you

21
00:03:26,845 --> 00:03:29,410
You really mattered when you said you
 would be here this week,didn't you?

22
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:30,593
I didn't see much point in waiting

23
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:33,708
I got a fairly good impression of
the situation on my visit here last month

24
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:35,751
I am anxious to see the lab in operation

25
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,926
I want to see Dr Pearson again,of course

26
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,214
Hold on call for a moment

27
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:47,695
Husband of a patient

28
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:49,218
Mr Stresky

29
00:03:54,448 --> 00:03:57,462
I am sorry Sir,I'll have the
treasury go over your bill

30
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:00,568
Good Bye Sir

31
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:03,542
People know that this hospital
doesn't make a profit

32
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:07,533
Not quite this time,claims  his wife
kept for a week too long

33
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:09,020
waiting for a pathology report

34
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,198
Now he has to go into debt to pay his bill

35
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:14,551
Now you want to see the rest of the place

36
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:15,860
He may as well know Harry

37
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,420
Surgical reports from Pathology
 is sometimes pretty late getting back

38
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,894
and there are times when we hesitate

39
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,409
to discharge patients without
 the final lab results

40
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:27,427
because those reports may effect the sort
of regimen the patient is placed on at home

41
00:04:27,427 --> 00:04:28,979
And with bed-space as valuable as it is

42
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:32,489
I see.Well I imagine that is one
of the reasons I am here

43
00:04:33,813 --> 00:04:34,940
Let's go

44
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:38,134
You want to see the end of bay

45
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,165
Regardless what you have heard Dr Coleman

46
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:55,598
Dr Pearson who has been in charge
of Pathology here for over 25 years..

47
00:04:55,598 --> 00:04:58,141
..is a good man,done a great
deal for this hospital

48
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,142
You should have heard the wall
towering when he set up the blood bank

49
00:05:01,142 --> 00:05:02,585
to salvage the hospital committee

50
00:05:03,232 --> 00:05:06,415
This year we will do three times as
 many tests as we did five years ago

51
00:05:08,304 --> 00:05:09,793
He did some investigate research too

52
00:05:10,462 --> 00:05:12,431
The cause and incidence of thyroid cancer

53
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:18,009
Most of it generally accepted now, but
few people remember it came from doctors..

54
00:05:18,222 --> 00:05:20,393
Well we took the shortcut
with the hot one didn't we?

55
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,858
Tomaselli,are you telling me to go slow?

56
00:05:24,811 --> 00:05:26,499
Make it easier for Dr Pearson

57
00:05:26,499 --> 00:05:28,372
I did not realize that it
came out like that

58
00:05:29,824 --> 00:05:31,172
I think in essence I am

59
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:39,768
Right this way,ladies,everybody
 gets the front seat today

60
00:05:42,537 --> 00:05:43,974
No hurry,ladies,no hurry

61
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:46,297
Star of the show is not going anywhere

62
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:54,690
Now,let's see

63
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:57,170
Which one of you is going to faint first?

64
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,004
This is a new class of nurses,I believe

65
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:11,575
I'll explain it,my name is Pearson

66
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:14,849
Pathologist for this hospital

67
00:06:15,305 --> 00:06:17,142
Dr Howard who is resident

68
00:06:18,456 --> 00:06:22,502
And Dr Shawcross who is in his fourth..
Am I right?

69
00:06:22,502 --> 00:06:23,419
Quite right Doctor

70
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:25,818
Fourth year of surgical residency

71
00:06:28,105 --> 00:06:34,464
And who will shortly be released
 upon an unsuspecting public

72
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:41,889
You often here people ask
what does a pathologist do

73
00:06:44,865 --> 00:06:46,915
Never hear anyone ask what a surgeon do

74
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:49,535
perhaps we all know what a surgeon do

75
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:56,413
A pathologist is the one who examines
the surgeon's mistakes when it is too late

76
00:06:57,298 --> 00:06:59,767
He is the doctor who the patient
 seldom sees,doesn't want to

77
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:03,633
Yet few departments in the hospital
have more effect in the patient's welfare

78
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,138
It is pathology which advises
the patient's physician on disease

79
00:07:09,705 --> 00:07:15,704
Sometimes when all else fails,it is the
pathologist who makes the final diagnosis

80
00:07:17,065 --> 00:07:20,060
That is a neat little abdominal scar,ain't?

81
00:07:21,012 --> 00:07:24,064
Some surgeon realized that
pretty paupered one day

82
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:28,705
Thank you

83
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:48,348
Mr Tomaselli

84
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:51,858
Mr Tomaselli,could I see you for a moment

85
00:07:52,617 --> 00:07:55,430
Just go down the hall and turn left and
Pathology I'll be right along

86
00:07:57,094 --> 00:08:01,103
I draw your attention,young ladies,to some
 words,you'll find in many autopsy rooms

87
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:06,293
"mortui vivos docebunt",
the death teach the living

88
00:08:07,497 --> 00:08:09,670
The medical history of this man
 shows three years ago

89
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,688
he suffered from the first coronary attack

90
00:08:11,688 --> 00:08:14,265
and the second attack during this week

91
00:08:14,265 --> 00:08:18,900
This man apparently died
of coronary thrombosis

92
00:08:32,665 --> 00:08:33,753
I beg you pardon

93
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,403
Suddenly school..

94
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:37,614
I agree with you

95
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,816
-Who are you?
-I am a pathologist

96
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:45,612
Your first autopsy

97
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:48,703
And last I hope

98
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:52,527
Alas,with most things in in medicine
 the first one is always the worst one

99
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:55,452
Go back in

100
00:08:57,616 --> 00:08:59,923
-What?
-Go back in there

101
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:06,509
I'm intending to,but not
because you ordered me to

102
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:13,544
Now we have established
 that in this specific case

103
00:09:13,544 --> 00:09:17,830
the medical diagnosis was correct,
we move to the cranial area

104
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,367
I hold in my hand a human brain

105
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:27,650
And yet what do you see?
Only a mass of tissue

106
00:09:28,696 --> 00:09:33,144
Only a few hours ago,this was
the thinking center of a human being

107
00:09:34,214 --> 00:09:38,935
Human being.Not only the thinking center,
but the co-ordinator

108
00:09:38,935 --> 00:09:42,549
of the senses,touch,smell,sight,taste

109
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:47,741
in her thoughts,hopes,dreams,memory

110
00:09:47,741 --> 00:09:52,300
told the eyes to cry,the mouth to speak

111
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,654
This man was an engineer,this then was
the brain that used mathematics

112
00:09:56,654 --> 00:10:02,779
understood stresses,devised constructions,
perhaps build houses,highways,dams

113
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:09,339
A cathedral,legacies from this
 brain to other human beings

114
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,734
Starting out your medical
career,young ladies

115
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:16,312
it  is just as well to think about
these things once in a while

116
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:22,256
Because in this big impersonal machine
 around here,this thing we call hospital

117
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:27,963
has one function,and only one,
to serve people

118
00:10:28,316 --> 00:10:34,144
This human being,male,aged 53,was a person

119
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:36,523
A human being

120
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,147
I see you found your way

121
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:46,208
You may now,young ladies,be free to go
 and forget everything I have said

122
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,459
Just as your predecessors
have done for the past 25 years

123
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:52,144
We go this way

124
00:10:52,469 --> 00:10:54,923
Dr Pearson is entertaining
 some student nurses again

125
00:10:55,928 --> 00:10:59,093
It not was I say,but when
 Dr Pearson sees those

126
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:00,776
He is going to pick you up and throw you..

127
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:03,415
That's fine,that's fine,just leave
 those reports please

128
00:11:03,415 --> 00:11:05,116
Good Morning Mr Tomaselli

129
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,371
Bannister,this is Dr Coleman

130
00:11:07,371 --> 00:11:10,732
Bannister is Senior Lab Technologist,
 been here almost as long as Dr Pearson

131
00:11:11,097 --> 00:11:13,208
As long as Dr Pearson,
How do you do, Dr Coleman

132
00:11:13,581 --> 00:11:15,049
We have been expecting you

133
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,446
Have you?

134
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,100
Sit down,sit down,there is a
terrible mess sometimes

135
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,982
We are busy,of course
we are almost always busy

136
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:36,456
You,young ladies should be congratulated
when a day no student faints

137
00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:38,732
I am beginning to have some hopes for men

138
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:41,091
Thank you

139
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,886
Try some bicarbonate soda

140
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,255
And make sure you are going
 out on a date tonight

141
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,810
Nothing like living

142
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:54,782
Sure forget dying

143
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:59,143
Good bye girls,have a nice lunch

144
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:05,526
Have a nice lunch

145
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:07,176
May never eat again

146
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:13,574
The eternal problem any hospital of course,
whose going to pay for the funds

147
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:15,619
-Oh there you are,Doctor,you remember
-I remember

148
00:12:17,964 --> 00:12:19,582
You look younger than you did last month

149
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:23,488
Bannister we have to find something
for this young fellow to do

150
00:12:23,895 --> 00:12:25,107
Now he is here

151
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:28,940
Your qualifications are good,
young fellow,on paper

152
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:30,846
Hope you can live up to it

153
00:12:30,926 --> 00:12:34,341
Get him a lab coat,Bannister,
and show him around

154
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:36,342
Coffee

155
00:12:37,063 --> 00:12:42,505
Don't let him see the  mark slides
 you keep hiding away for your garden

156
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:49,611
I am late for a mortality review committee
make yourself at home

157
00:12:57,882 --> 00:13:00,564
It is downright upsetting by taken by
 a hug strong by your own wife

158
00:13:00,564 --> 00:13:04,578
I have only one rule for a happy troika,
never hug off with your wife

159
00:13:05,777 --> 00:13:06,887
Sorry

160
00:13:09,064 --> 00:13:10,712
I am sorry for everybody.I had an autopsy

161
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,104
Impatient,impatient

162
00:13:12,104 --> 00:13:14,259
Nowhere to go,we couldn't wait to get there

163
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:18,821
I used to be called for something
a doctor prescribed for his patients

164
00:13:19,492 --> 00:13:20,532
Now an ordinary layman

165
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:24,340
can't  get near the first D without
 pushing the doctors into the sand trap

166
00:13:26,183 --> 00:13:32,451
First case Algernon Forbes,
male,white,58.Dr Rufus

167
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:36,622
The patient was referred to me February 10
 with a suspected perforated ulcer

168
00:13:36,622 --> 00:13:39,735
He had severe upper abdominal
pain and was in shock

169
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:43,378
Blood pressure was 70/40,he was ashen
 grey and was in a cold sweat

170
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:46,356
The abdomen was rigid and
it was rebound tenderness

171
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,212
I ordered a transfusion to combat
shock and also morphine

172
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:52,803
No chest field X ray,Dr Rufus

173
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,065
It was my opinion that the patient
was too sick to go to X-ray

174
00:13:56,821 --> 00:14:00,025
I agreed with the referring doctor's
 diagnosis,obviously perforated ulcer

175
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,567
No doubts at all,Doctor

176
00:14:03,465 --> 00:14:05,087
One always has doubts,Dr Pearson,

177
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:09,260
but I decided that all the symptoms
 justified exploratory surgery

178
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:12,612
However,there was no perforated ulcer

179
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:17,261
I called Dr Jones for consultation but
before he arrived the patient died

180
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:23,730
Dr Pearson.Now is the time
 for the autopsy findings.

181
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,830
No perforated ulcer,abdomen
 entirely normal.

182
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:31,098
What was causing the severe pleuritic
pain was early development of pneumonia

183
00:14:31,098 --> 00:14:33,365
Which could have been
discovered by chest X ray

184
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:38,256
It is very easy to have hindsight,
Dr Pearson loses no chance to remind us

185
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:39,459
I don't think Dr Pearson intended o..

186
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:41,659
Any man can make a mistake in medicine

187
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:44,813
but having been made that mistake
 should serve as a warning

188
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:48,495
to others who can't see beyond the
area of their own surgical specialty

189
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,250
If Dr Pearson was conscientious
about his own department

190
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,775
as he is what's goes on at
 the upper floors here,

191
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:59,333
Perhaps, we all get our surgical
 reports from pathology in time

192
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:04,690
Gentlemen,I have repeatedly
requested more help

193
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,727
My department is
snowed down,I ask for technicians

194
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:11,670
Technicians.Instead the
staff of this hospital

195
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,697
Joe,Joe

196
00:15:12,697 --> 00:15:16,531
The staff of this hospital decided a new
pathologist was needed to assist me

197
00:15:17,215 --> 00:15:19,803
You now have that man on step,
and I have no doubts

198
00:15:19,803 --> 00:15:22,392
That you'll now have your
 surgical reports on time

199
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:25,905
But as long as I am head pathologist here

200
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:29,884
when I attend a mortality review
 committee I intend to call the shots

201
00:15:29,884 --> 00:15:33,866
as I see them, and when the time comes ,
when I do not attend this committee

202
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,190
it will be because I am no
longer member of this staff

203
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,408
Ah,Joe,you are taking all
 this whole more seriously

204
00:15:38,408 --> 00:15:41,276
And if I am not a member,it will
be that I have been kicked off

205
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,660
Because I have to be kicked out
since I have no intentions of resigning

206
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,925
Not until they roll me
down with my feet first

207
00:15:49,092 --> 00:15:52,822
As there are no more surgical errors
to be discussed,I am sure you'll excuse me

208
00:15:52,822 --> 00:15:55,834
Good Morning Gentlemen and the Lady

209
00:16:02,326 --> 00:16:04,087
-Joe
-I know,I know

210
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:06,067
Patience,your hot headed idiot

211
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:08,560
Charlie,I have no place to
go,my lab been invaded

212
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,877
Invaded.You are acting downright senile

213
00:16:10,877 --> 00:16:12,097
Listen,Beth shoul..

214
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:16,542
Beth.She wouldn't be proud of you

215
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,194
If Beth was alive she would
 not be proud of you

216
00:16:20,656 --> 00:16:22,542
What if we both getting older

217
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:24,107
Speak for yourself,Joe

218
00:16:26,714 --> 00:16:30,643
-Charlie.You need a haircut
-No,I didn't..

219
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:36,899
Doctor,this is Mrs Alexander

220
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:40,445
Come right in,I am sorry
to keep you waiting

221
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,995
But sometimes these things take longer
 in the hospital than we anticipated

222
00:16:45,598 --> 00:16:48,631
I guess you know all about that
your husband is an intern here

223
00:17:05,662 --> 00:17:07,547
Thank you Dr Alexander

224
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:11,492
Doctor,than I am perfectly healthy then?

225
00:17:11,492 --> 00:17:13,034
Nothing to worry about is it?

226
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:14,352
Nothing whatever

227
00:17:14,832 --> 00:17:17,544
The fact you strike me as
one of those rare young women

228
00:17:17,544 --> 00:17:19,660
who can deliver her own child under a tree

229
00:17:20,345 --> 00:17:23,118
And then plough 10 acre field
in the afternoon

230
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:28,307
Btw what did your first child die of?

231
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,003
Bronchitis,when she was a month old

232
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:43,541
I guess that this child is
doubly important to you

233
00:17:48,752 --> 00:17:53,024
Yes.Yes very important.Why is it
 something you haven't told me?

234
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,145
Oh,no.There is absolutely
no cause for alarm

235
00:17:57,584 --> 00:18:00,105
Take that to the out patient lab

236
00:18:00,105 --> 00:18:03,545
I am sure your husband,or the doctor..

237
00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:06,636
who made that first blood test on
you some months ago must have told you..

238
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:11,072
that even if the blood test does
reveal antibodies in your blood

239
00:18:11,072 --> 00:18:14,600
that only 1 child in 26 ever
 develop erythroblastosis

240
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,262
and even if that happens
 we can be prepared

241
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,759
We know that it is a possibility

242
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:22,546
All that depends on a
new blood test of course

243
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:28,898
In the end Mrs Alexander you are
going to have a normal healthy baby

244
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:31,634
Doctor Dornberger you are wonderful

245
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:35,788
I did not have anything to do with it

246
00:18:40,672 --> 00:18:41,828
Elizabeth

247
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:52,425
Not yet

248
00:18:53,608 --> 00:18:54,837
What took so long?

249
00:18:55,538 --> 00:18:57,744
They haven't even taken a blood sample yet

250
00:18:57,744 --> 00:19:01,114
Alec.Dr Dornberger is the
greatest doctor in the world

251
00:19:01,114 --> 00:19:02,428
Oh,yes?

252
00:19:04,387 --> 00:19:05,937
Except you,of course

253
00:19:08,872 --> 00:19:10,832
Next to be,of course

254
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,275
Oh,I do not go on duty until 2 o'clock,Sir

255
00:19:19,155 --> 00:19:21,187
Something you young
people will never learn

256
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:23,071
One thing leads to another

257
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:26,279
You start by stealing
 a kiss in a hallway

258
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:29,648
pretty soon you will be having  baby

259
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:38,003
This way,Mrs Alexander

260
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:40,153
Thank you ,doctor

261
00:20:11,193 --> 00:20:12,785
Come in,come in

262
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:14,927
Nobody stands in ceremony around here

263
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:15,635
Doctor Pearson

264
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:18,665
Civilization is strangling
 itself in red tape

265
00:20:18,665 --> 00:20:21,845
Doctor Pearson I have been here
in exactly 3 hours and fifteen minutes

266
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:23,964
If you want a coffee break take it

267
00:20:24,147 --> 00:20:26,767
Is it your idea to have me sit around
 here all day doing nothing

268
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,868
Until you can decide
what my duties would be

269
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:30,949
It is a hard matter to find time

270
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,641
You are fiery,aren't you?

271
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:38,260
I assumed that the very least there
would be an office ready for me

272
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,873
with clearly defined duties

273
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:43,076
Fiery.I picked you for one

274
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:45,368
Good.You want work.
Plenty work to be done

275
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:47,688
I am scientist not the administrator

276
00:20:48,224 --> 00:20:50,914
You'll find work for your own level

277
00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:54,151
Meantime why don't you take
 over the autopsy room

278
00:20:54,168 --> 00:20:58,269
Seems the engine is running
 there to doctor Alywishes cue oil

279
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:01,472
I've always had a great interest and
a good deal of experience in serology

280
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:03,876
-I have been looking over the serology lab
-Serology

281
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:08,913
Why not

282
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:12,162
Thereafter you are in
 charge of serology

283
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:14,866
-Anything else?
-Not right now

284
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:17,069
Thank you,Dr Pearson

285
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,941
-You are ready for the gros..
-No I'm not ready

286
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:27,784
I am ready as I ever be

287
00:21:32,478 --> 00:21:34,685
She was not only a nurse,
she was a minister's daughter

288
00:21:35,636 --> 00:21:37,074
The odds were all on my side

289
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:40,457
Put out that cigarette please

290
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:43,151
Good Morning Doctor Coleman,
I didn't see you there

291
00:21:43,191 --> 00:21:45,595
There will be now smoking in the
 autopsy room,Dr Shawcross

292
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,271
Not there

293
00:21:49,062 --> 00:21:50,865
Dr Howard will you drape the patient

294
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:54,797
With a clean towel

295
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,428
Gentlemen,there is something
 I need to remind you of

296
00:22:01,431 --> 00:22:04,265
When we perform an autopsy we do
so with the permission of the family

297
00:22:04,265 --> 00:22:08,475
of the one who has died.Our objective is
to advance medical learning

298
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:13,741
The family gives us the body in trust and
expect it to be treated with care respect..

299
00:22:13,741 --> 00:22:17,266
..and dignity.And that's
 how it will be treated

300
00:22:17,697 --> 00:22:20,424
Thank you ,gentlemen,carry on please

301
00:22:24,584 --> 00:22:27,185
We appeared to have been
skillfully taken apart

302
00:22:27,709 --> 00:22:28,707
We sure have

303
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,940
Pardon me,my name is Alexander,Doctor
 Alexander I am intern upstairs

304
00:22:40,672 --> 00:22:41,598
Yes,Doctor

305
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:43,784
It is about my wife,we just arrived here

306
00:22:44,091 --> 00:22:46,249
She is Dr Dornberger's patient

307
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:48,258
and we are expecting a baby
 in a month and a half

308
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,514
Well,congratulations,doctor

309
00:22:50,564 --> 00:22:53,033
It was you who supposed
to have a blood sensitation test today

310
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:54,946
I wonder if you have
any results on it yet

311
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:58,111
We probably wont even get
the samples until this afternoon

312
00:22:58,111 --> 00:22:59,748
-Even if we do..
-This is very important

313
00:22:59,748 --> 00:23:02,139
You see,she is Rh neg and I am Rh positive

314
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:03,897
How long does it take to
make the three tests

315
00:23:03,993 --> 00:23:04,293
Not long

316
00:23:04,293 --> 00:23:06,847
-Two tests,not three
-Two tests?

317
00:23:07,518 --> 00:23:08,836
Yes,saline,high protein..

318
00:23:08,836 --> 00:23:12,675
Don't most labs now make
 an indirect Coomb's too?

319
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,938
Indirect what?

320
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,725
You don't even know what it is?

321
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:18,706
Look maybe you better
come back and see Dr Pearson

322
00:23:19,158 --> 00:23:22,172
I don't know much about serology
 but I have studied it up because of this

323
00:23:22,172 --> 00:23:24,041
It has been proven that
 some of the antibodies

324
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,799
in the blood of pregnant women can get past

325
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:27,878
 both the saline test and high protein test

326
00:23:27,878 --> 00:23:29,556
only the indirect Coomb test

327
00:23:29,556 --> 00:23:31,559
Forget doctor,you are way of limits here

328
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,758
I have not got time to sit
around here the whole day

329
00:23:33,768 --> 00:23:34,937
Listen,Mr,you are going to make time,

330
00:23:34,937 --> 00:23:37,732
this is my wife and that baby
 is very important to us

331
00:23:38,108 --> 00:23:40,736
Dr Alexander I am Dr Coleman
Assistant Pathologist here

332
00:23:40,915 --> 00:23:41,996
Certainly you must realize

333
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:43,237
I know that you will have
 the results of the tests

334
00:23:43,237 --> 00:23:45,253
tomorrow afternoon for
 your wife's physician

335
00:23:45,253 --> 00:23:47,861
if you are on duty upstairs I
suggest that you go back to it

336
00:23:50,201 --> 00:23:51,699
All right,but I tell you one thing

337
00:23:51,699 --> 00:23:54,418
my wife is going to get
every test available

338
00:23:58,725 --> 00:24:01,660
Is there anything more ridiculous
 than an expecting father

339
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:03,872
Yes.A serology lab without Coomb serum

340
00:24:04,475 --> 00:24:05,103
What?

341
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:08,634
An indirect Coombs for blood sensitization
 is elementary today,basic

342
00:24:09,841 --> 00:24:11,910
Let's get some here in
time for Alexander’s wife

343
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,505
We can't just go out and
 buy it like it was aspirin

344
00:24:14,505 --> 00:24:16,217
You have to have a purchase requisition

345
00:24:16,217 --> 00:24:17,675
Let me have one of the form

346
00:24:22,685 --> 00:24:26,070
Dr Pearson always order the
lab supplies himself

347
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:30,925
I intend to have more authority here than
 ordering 15 $ worth of rabbit serum

348
00:24:46,392 --> 00:24:49,523
Well,when you get to my age the
 best part of any day is the end of it

349
00:24:51,188 --> 00:24:53,773
Are you going to leave this like,this?

350
00:24:54,078 --> 00:24:55,166
Nudge me?

351
00:24:55,213 --> 00:24:56,879
The only company we really get down
 here

352
00:24:57,105 --> 00:24:59,716
are all locked up in the ice
 pack in the morgue

353
00:24:59,716 --> 00:25:00,757
Bannister

354
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:05,024
Never failed,never

355
00:25:09,797 --> 00:25:10,626
What's the trouble?

356
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:12,778
I'll tell you.It's the purchase orders

357
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:14,344
Do you think this is the Mayo clinic?

358
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:16,220
We got to have lab supplies

359
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,267
Yes but look at these.What do
 we need Coomb's serum for

360
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:23,789
It is a blood sensitization test,
it is elementary,basic

361
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:27,509
-It's what?
-Dr Coleman ordered it

362
00:25:28,263 --> 00:25:31,107
He signed the requisition himself.Look

363
00:25:32,513 --> 00:25:33,757
So he did

364
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,675
Don't stand there looking for trouble

365
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:39,775
I put Dr Coleman in charge of
 serology myself this morning

366
00:25:40,868 --> 00:25:43,160
It is quitting time,go and wash
your hands,or something

367
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,669
You don't approve our order
how we keep our sera,Dr Coleman

368
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:06,913
I can't honestly say I do

369
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:09,844
Auto labs look spick-and-span,
glitter and clean

370
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:14,657
The only difference being we don't
care about manicures and haircuts here

371
00:26:15,706 --> 00:26:18,377
We judge the lab and the man
 with the practice of medicine

372
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,991
No time for the thrills

373
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,392
Any other suggestions,Dr Coleman?

374
00:26:23,392 --> 00:26:25,869
Well,now that you ask I
do have one in particular

375
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,006
As many as you like,Dr Coleman

376
00:26:28,006 --> 00:26:30,079
One way of speeding surgical reports

377
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:32,557
Who is talking to you
 about surgical reports?

378
00:26:33,105 --> 00:26:35,300
Have you ever considered
a tissue processing machine?

379
00:26:35,691 --> 00:26:39,169
It should save at least a day compared
to the method preparing the slides by hand

380
00:26:40,727 --> 00:26:42,606
Come in my office,Dr Coleman

381
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:47,199
Do you see these?

382
00:26:48,036 --> 00:26:51,420
These are purchase requisitions
for equipment dating back years

383
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,062
Every time I put a bunch of these through
 I have a battle with the administrators

384
00:26:55,062 --> 00:26:57,059
He goes to the board and
 have a battle with them

385
00:26:57,464 --> 00:26:59,989
and then he comes back and say
we are spending too much money

386
00:27:01,366 --> 00:27:02,584
You listen to me,Coleman

387
00:27:03,868 --> 00:27:06,319
You are not here for my invitation,
you understand

388
00:27:06,951 --> 00:27:09,435
They pushed you down my gullet
and I am choking on you boy

389
00:27:10,084 --> 00:27:12,175
My patience is turning purple
trying to swallow you

390
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:13,228
but I'm going to do it

391
00:27:13,228 --> 00:27:16,154
Let's get our policies straightened
out here once and for all

392
00:27:16,154 --> 00:27:20,067
You got a job to do and so have I.
 I am in charge of this department

393
00:27:20,865 --> 00:27:22,031
We are going to do those jobs

394
00:27:22,031 --> 00:27:23,909
We might get our wires
 crossed everyday

395
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:25,545
but without interfering with our works

396
00:27:25,545 --> 00:27:29,747
but I am still in charge here
You follow me?

397
00:27:31,949 --> 00:27:33,142
I follow you

398
00:27:59,714 --> 00:28:03,555
-Here are the purchase orders.
-All of them?

399
00:28:03,555 --> 00:28:06,156
What? The requisition for Coomb's serum

400
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,312
I forgot all about that

401
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:13,341
We have been getting along with two
tests for blood sensitization for years now

402
00:28:13,683 --> 00:28:15,032
We don't need it

403
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:16,957
Good Night Doctor Pearson

404
00:29:01,712 --> 00:29:02,663
Dr Coleman

405
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,710
I thought I recognized you Dr Coleman

406
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,109
I want to apologize for
the way I acted today

407
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:10,433
-My wife and I..
-No need for apologies

408
00:29:10,628 --> 00:29:13,755
As a matter of fact.You were right.
The Coomb's serum has been ordered

409
00:29:13,755 --> 00:29:16,106
Your wife test will be made
 in all three mediums

410
00:29:16,825 --> 00:29:17,737
Thank you Doctor

411
00:29:18,248 --> 00:29:21,068
No idea of the relief.Thank you very much

412
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:51,738
Turned your ankle?

413
00:29:52,466 --> 00:29:53,959
-Hello
-What is the trouble?

414
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:57,800
Nothing.Nothing much.My knee just..

415
00:29:58,393 --> 00:30:00,466
Sit over there.Come on.

416
00:30:05,308 --> 00:30:08,148
-Thank you.
-Now let's take a look at it

417
00:30:09,356 --> 00:30:13,720
-Don't be silly
-Don't you be silly.I am a doctor

418
00:30:15,604 --> 00:30:16,842
Where is the pain?

419
00:30:17,518 --> 00:30:18,764
It's about here

420
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:23,474
Dr Coleman.People are watching

421
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,275
How did you know my name?

422
00:30:26,961 --> 00:30:31,599
The voices were very high.I guess that.
And the new ghoul in pathology

423
00:30:34,221 --> 00:30:37,319
-Miss?
-Hunt.Cathrine

424
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:39,802
Miss Hunt.You are a phoney

425
00:30:43,356 --> 00:30:44,399
Oh.Really

426
00:30:45,138 --> 00:30:47,313
There is nothing that matters
 with your knee,Miss Hunt

427
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:54,949
You think .That is the most conceited
egotistical thing I ever heard

428
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,942
Make up your mind,Mr

429
00:31:10,942 --> 00:31:11,554
How much?

430
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:14,719
For you? 15 cents

431
00:31:24,152 --> 00:31:25,791
No apologies please

432
00:31:25,995 --> 00:31:28,345
I'm not apologizing.Where are you going?

433
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:33,353
I have exactly 3 hours and 10 minutes and
I am going to spend them with Marlon Brando

434
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:44,659
You wouldn't like

435
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,185
I'll have dinner with you

436
00:31:51,105 --> 00:31:52,703
In a restaurant

437
00:31:53,844 --> 00:31:56,705
with the wine

438
00:32:01,165 --> 00:32:03,471
will be a good time
right out of town

439
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:05,521
Wine? And dancing?

440
00:32:06,345 --> 00:32:07,464
If that’s been necessary

441
00:32:07,464 --> 00:32:08,477
I know just the place

442
00:32:09,151 --> 00:32:10,672
Sure you can dance with that bad knee?

443
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:13,863
Oh.I know I can.I am a phoney.You remember?

444
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,900
I have only three more years with lectures

445
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,149
Won't be long

446
00:32:21,459 --> 00:32:23,741
As soon my internship is over

447
00:32:32,087 --> 00:32:33,435
Take that look off your face

448
00:32:33,435 --> 00:32:35,385
I hate you talking that way

449
00:32:39,061 --> 00:32:42,394
I never heard my father discuss
 money once,not once

450
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:44,792
Your father was one of the dying breed

451
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:48,151
He was old fashioned
 practitioner in a small town

452
00:32:48,823 --> 00:32:51,519
We always used jelly deserts
 except when the cousins came

453
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,597
Nobody minded

454
00:32:54,113 --> 00:32:55,074
My mind

455
00:32:55,631 --> 00:32:59,505
You have to go to bed.And so is she

456
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,648
She is a strong little struggler isn't she?

457
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,639
There is only one way to get the best.
And that is to specialize

458
00:33:09,102 --> 00:33:11,991
And the only place a man can
specialize is in a big town

459
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:16,384
Papa only called it one thing from the
Bible,I can't remember it exactly

460
00:33:16,713 --> 00:33:20,959
Something about a man finding
 himself and losing himself

461
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:22,621
I don't know anything about the Bible

462
00:33:22,621 --> 00:33:25,469
Your father died owning nothing

463
00:33:25,469 --> 00:33:27,946
He was rich,the richest man you ever know

464
00:33:27,946 --> 00:33:31,716
everybody in that county loved him,
in the funeral there were so many cars

465
00:33:31,716 --> 00:33:34,670
I loved him too but it is
 different today,that's all

466
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,466
Yes.There is not a single
 doctor in Richmond

467
00:33:38,126 --> 00:33:40,838
You really would  like it,wouldn't you,
 if I went back to Richmond

468
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:42,838
-..opened a little office
-Shut up

469
00:33:42,838 --> 00:33:44,124
Will you please

470
00:33:44,518 --> 00:33:45,793
Medicine is all of business

471
00:33:45,793 --> 00:33:51,410
Shut up.Before papa turn over in..

472
00:34:03,462 --> 00:34:04,657
Alec.

473
00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:08,104
I love you

474
00:34:09,176 --> 00:34:11,238
I always love you what you decide

475
00:34:11,754 --> 00:34:16,713
Have our baby no matter how big,
or important or rich we are

476
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:24,387
You know I wish for you sake
 that it was all over

477
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:27,069
Whoever invented this 9 month thing any way

478
00:34:27,676 --> 00:34:30,952
It is not so bad,I went through it once
 before,I don't care how bad it is

479
00:34:30,952 --> 00:34:35,239
How hard Just it doesn't end the same way

480
00:34:53,954 --> 00:34:57,664
Just to get away for a
little while sometimes

481
00:34:59,343 --> 00:35:01,513
From all the pain and sickness

482
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,385
All the blood and the fear in their eyes

483
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:06,951
It gets to me too much sometimes

484
00:35:07,596 --> 00:35:08,984
You begin to wonder where..

485
00:35:12,089 --> 00:35:14,326
I have never said anything like
 this to anyone before

486
00:35:14,977 --> 00:35:18,107
-Sorry you did?
-No

487
00:35:18,878 --> 00:35:21,085
That's what makes it all more confusing

488
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:24,950
Cathy,there isn't anyone in medicine
 who hasn't felt the way you do

489
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,003
One time or another

490
00:35:26,003 --> 00:35:28,303
But I felt it more and more lately

491
00:35:28,657 --> 00:35:30,558
and I do not why I am talking about it now

492
00:35:30,558 --> 00:35:36,034
when I feel so fine.
I really feel so delicious

493
00:35:37,984 --> 00:35:41,175
I am so glad that I thought of
 my plot to get a date of you

494
00:35:43,078 --> 00:35:49,207
You know.If I was as honest
as you are,I have to tell you

495
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:58,706
that I really honestly despise the
strong silent type who just listen

496
00:35:59,744 --> 00:36:01,909
From this let's talk about you for a moment

497
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,931
What made you decide to be a ghoul?

498
00:36:07,526 --> 00:36:11,513
Pathology seemed the best way
 to contribute to the war

499
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:12,898
The war?

500
00:36:12,898 --> 00:36:15,064
Medicine is a war,creative,constructive war

501
00:36:15,064 --> 00:36:19,348
Not many of us can be heroes
like Pasteur,Fleming or Salk

502
00:36:20,037 --> 00:36:23,032
But sometimes there is
a spectacular advance

503
00:36:23,032 --> 00:36:24,149
as in a war

504
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:26,144
when doctors rush to the new front

505
00:36:26,703 --> 00:36:30,116
leaving lots of pockets of
knowledge behind to be filled in

506
00:36:33,863 --> 00:36:37,140
Never heard anyone
talk about like that before

507
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,792
Make me feel like a trivial little idiot

508
00:36:41,561 --> 00:36:43,195
I was wrong about you

509
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:47,230
You really are a good dancer

510
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:59,337
That Dr Pearson,do you know
what he advised me this morning

511
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:02,258
He said one way of get
rid of the taste of death

512
00:37:02,258 --> 00:37:06,780
is by living and he was so right

513
00:37:45,186 --> 00:37:47,152
I am two minutes early

514
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,348
Thank you for a lovely dinner

515
00:37:51,273 --> 00:37:53,544
You don't have to pay any debt,Cathy

516
00:37:55,418 --> 00:37:57,197
The man is not even human

517
00:38:08,657 --> 00:38:10,113
Human

518
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,630
Why did not you think of it earlier?

519
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:17,950
Good Night

520
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,579
Yes Doctor we will send it up as
soon as we get the report

521
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:14,465
Everybody wants everything
the day before yesterday

522
00:39:14,529 --> 00:39:16,618
Good Morning Bannister

523
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,160
What the devil is being going around here?

524
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,910
Don't look at me

525
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,399
I did not recognize the place

526
00:39:24,399 --> 00:39:25,993
Where the magic can't find it

527
00:39:28,346 --> 00:39:30,259
Now that is more like it

528
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:33,947
Mr Bannister

529
00:39:35,104 --> 00:39:37,508
Dr Alexander.I just told Dr Dornberger

530
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,502
the blood samples only got
 down here last evening

531
00:39:40,633 --> 00:39:42,982
-What's all this?
-It's about my wife's blood tests,doctor

532
00:39:43,232 --> 00:39:44,478
We have a possible Rh factor..

533
00:39:44,511 --> 00:39:47,947
So don't you come barging in down here and
 we show you a special favour

534
00:39:49,385 --> 00:39:51,875
Perhaps we don't operate
that way in this department,Doctor

535
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:52,487
Alexander

536
00:39:54,064 --> 00:39:55,733
You get the results in due time

537
00:39:56,303 --> 00:39:58,105
and through Charlie Dornberger

538
00:40:07,026 --> 00:40:08,085
Alexander!

539
00:40:08,887 --> 00:40:09,387
Yes Sir

540
00:40:12,228 --> 00:40:16,220
Call me in half an hour we
will have the result for you

541
00:40:16,988 --> 00:40:18,788
Thank you Dr Pearson.Thanks a lot

542
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,066
Good Morning

543
00:40:23,405 --> 00:40:24,512
Good Morning Bannister

544
00:40:26,516 --> 00:40:27,797
Good Morning Dr Coleman

545
00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:32,609
Some days just confuse me

546
00:40:33,789 --> 00:40:42,712
Lung fibrosis,small recognizable nodules,
peptic ulcer just below the pyloric ring

547
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,718
Surprising thing about the human
 body is not what finally kills us

548
00:40:51,718 --> 00:40:54,229
but what we can have wrong
with us and still go on living

549
00:40:56,802 --> 00:40:58,919
This woman should have
 gone to a doctor in time

550
00:40:58,919 --> 00:41:02,227
a simple operation would
 have saved her life

551
00:41:05,558 --> 00:41:06,671
Oh,Bannister

552
00:41:06,671 --> 00:41:08,999
You've got to supervise the
 histology section more closely

553
00:41:09,388 --> 00:41:11,440
Your slice is sticking up
 to look like a sandwich

554
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:24,115
Dr O'Donnell Surgery please

555
00:41:31,795 --> 00:41:33,164
This place vacant?

556
00:41:33,164 --> 00:41:36,110
Not yet.But if you don't
 sit down it will be

557
00:41:37,033 --> 00:41:39,630
-Last night you mentioned..
-Do you want to try some of this?

558
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,701
No thanks

559
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,227
Last night I'm afraid  I
mentioned too many things

560
00:41:43,227 --> 00:41:44,561
Too many? Not enough

561
00:41:44,591 --> 00:41:45,439
Aren't you hungry?

562
00:41:45,866 --> 00:41:46,670
I'm starving

563
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,122
Will you listen to me for a second?

564
00:41:48,203 --> 00:41:50,151
I am trying to find out to
 get to know you better

565
00:41:50,231 --> 00:41:52,523
I am not good at small talk
and flirting things like that

566
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,185
What I am saying is that..

567
00:41:56,822 --> 00:41:58,538
How I am going to see more of you?

568
00:41:59,946 --> 00:42:01,606
-You actually..
-No

569
00:42:02,381 --> 00:42:04,072
Good.Then I know just the same

570
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:06,074
You two eating again

571
00:42:06,431 --> 00:42:08,193
I am.Dr Coleman is on his diet

572
00:42:10,024 --> 00:42:13,284
That seems to be the socially accepted
 form of suicide these days

573
00:42:13,284 --> 00:42:15,400
-Dr Pearson
-I'm coming.I'm coming

574
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:18,555
Don't say I never take lunch,Coleman

575
00:42:22,837 --> 00:42:25,712
I am glad Dr Pearson is not on diet

576
00:42:48,046 --> 00:42:51,992
These are reports for the coroner
 on my desk I'll sign it

577
00:42:53,316 --> 00:42:54,105
Joe

578
00:42:57,906 --> 00:42:59,760
Accident case.Dead on arrival

579
00:43:00,586 --> 00:43:01,538
Five years old

580
00:43:04,903 --> 00:43:06,346
Charlie what's it all means

581
00:43:07,259 --> 00:43:09,926
You want me give you a
 philosophy of life and ten words

582
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:15,266
There is no philosophy,Charlie,impossible,
all chance,you never know what next

583
00:43:15,608 --> 00:43:16,826
Life.Death

584
00:43:18,657 --> 00:43:20,774
We are trying to fix some
 of the accidents out of it

585
00:43:21,587 --> 00:43:23,752
Now what about the Alexander girl

586
00:43:23,752 --> 00:43:26,537
-Alexander?
-Rh factor

587
00:43:27,144 --> 00:43:28,950
-Husband intern
-Oh Alexander ..

588
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:34,138
..I did the test myself sensitivity
 negative no problems actually

589
00:43:34,138 --> 00:43:34,870
I tell the boy

590
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:36,867
Oh,I already told him

591
00:43:37,635 --> 00:43:40,264
-You?
-Kid nagged me what else could I do

592
00:43:41,944 --> 00:43:42,903
Joe

593
00:43:45,265 --> 00:43:46,539
Need a haircut

594
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:25,178
Did you break anything?

595
00:44:26,015 --> 00:44:27,196
What did you have in mind

596
00:44:27,755 --> 00:44:29,752
This one must known to the doctor

597
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:06,859
I bet you are the kind
that goes into convulsion

598
00:45:06,859 --> 00:45:08,998
when you see somebody slip on a banana peel

599
00:45:10,267 --> 00:45:11,098
I'm sorry

600
00:45:12,478 --> 00:45:13,698
You are so dignified

601
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,267
and so sure of yourself

602
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:23,588
Just hold on,take it easy,and fly

603
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,474
Fly

604
00:45:31,672 --> 00:45:33,441
Not my idea to be different Cathy

605
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:37,696
But we seen each every
day for more than a week now

606
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:40,461
And we are never alone,
there is always an audience

607
00:45:40,461 --> 00:45:42,731
I didn't know you had anything
 to say to me in private

608
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:46,634
I may look like a fool
and I feel like a fool

609
00:45:46,669 --> 00:45:49,723
We are not teenagers,you know,
not them,we are adults

610
00:46:10,186 --> 00:46:13,518
-If you had a car
-I'll get one.I rent one

611
00:46:14,437 --> 00:46:16,060
I have Sunday afternoon off too

612
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,605
Just a wonderful country I could show you

613
00:46:38,863 --> 00:46:39,687
Cathy are you hurt?

614
00:46:40,232 --> 00:46:43,354
-This is my knee
-Where it did last week?

615
00:46:44,675 --> 00:46:47,192
Oh,yes.I am a phoney.Remember?

616
00:47:00,311 --> 00:47:01,663
Very tender isn't it?

617
00:47:03,347 --> 00:47:04,751
How long have you had this Cathy?

618
00:47:06,591 --> 00:47:12,755
A couple of,maybe a month.
Not serious Dr Grainger

619
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:14,825
Anything can be serious and not serious

620
00:47:14,825 --> 00:47:16,494
I wouldn't be too concerned if I were you

621
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:19,548
We both want to know,
so I will arrange an X ray

622
00:47:30,986 --> 00:47:32,307
OK Cathy

623
00:47:50,718 --> 00:47:53,788
Killer Appendicitis Dr Rufus had a good..

624
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:58,299
-Do you want to see me?
-Yes.In your office,please,Dr.

625
00:48:06,278 --> 00:48:09,438
Dr Pearson I have been running some
 routine checks on the hot water system

626
00:48:09,438 --> 00:48:11,587
The water temperature is not high enough

627
00:48:11,587 --> 00:48:16,389
Exactly.Has anyone tried
to do anything about it?

628
00:48:18,117 --> 00:48:20,367
You think that things run
poorly around here don't you?

629
00:48:21,077 --> 00:48:22,475
As you keep asking.Yes I do

630
00:48:23,352 --> 00:48:25,714
Young,green full of lofty ideas

631
00:48:25,714 --> 00:48:28,993
I have been pleading for a new
 hot water system for a year

632
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:33,678
It is too expensive project.
Anything else Dr Coleman?

633
00:48:34,547 --> 00:48:36,670
No.I apologize

634
00:48:36,898 --> 00:48:38,513
Full of vinegar I suppose.

635
00:48:38,513 --> 00:48:42,010
Hear that you been laying
down the law in the autopsy room too

636
00:48:42,317 --> 00:48:43,680
You asked me to take charge of it

637
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:45,257
No smoking I understand

638
00:48:46,413 --> 00:48:47,755
Is that suppose to enthuse me?

639
00:48:47,755 --> 00:48:48,655
Sign Read No Smoking

640
00:48:49,467 --> 00:48:51,208
Are you laying down the law to me boy?

641
00:48:52,545 --> 00:48:55,837
As I understand it,the hospital is to
be run for the welfare of the patients

642
00:48:56,238 --> 00:48:59,473
Rules are set up for all,
there can be no law at all

643
00:48:59,473 --> 00:49:02,469
Here or anywhere if there
 are privileged exceptions

644
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:06,879
Shuffle of fancy ideas,
aren't you.All idea no blood

645
00:49:08,691 --> 00:49:10,938
You've been here a week and
 Bannister is ready to quit

646
00:49:10,938 --> 00:49:12,624
Might be safer if he did

647
00:49:12,676 --> 00:49:14,227
Three days ago I told the technicians

648
00:49:14,227 --> 00:49:16,617
that I planned to make occasional
 spot check on lab work

649
00:49:16,617 --> 00:49:19,516
Yesterday I divided the blood samples
so the two tests would be runner

650
00:49:19,516 --> 00:49:20,274
Schreck

651
00:49:20,274 --> 00:49:21,420
Standard laboratory procedures

652
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,118
Bannister reached two
different results from the same sample

653
00:49:24,204 --> 00:49:25,244
Everybody makes mistakes

654
00:49:25,244 --> 00:49:26,826
There is no room for mistakes in medicine

655
00:49:26,826 --> 00:49:28,383
When it comes to surgeons you yourself

656
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:32,008
You got your tummy boy,believe
me I have seen your kind before

657
00:49:32,008 --> 00:49:35,556
You blood less hound,everything
 spic-span,so sure of yourself

658
00:49:36,028 --> 00:49:38,392
You learn that you are not
 perfect one of these days,boy

659
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:42,143
It will be quite a shock,I hope I
will be around and see it that's all

660
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:45,279
And I will be around,because listen boy,
 I am here to stay

661
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:48,060
You just shoving and pushing but I
am here to stay,don't forget it

662
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:50,108
If you don't like the ways
the things are run here

663
00:49:50,108 --> 00:49:51,908
you are free to move boy,move on

664
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,717
I am not moving

665
00:49:58,103 --> 00:50:00,783
I am staying too,don't forget that,ever

666
00:50:00,783 --> 00:50:02,916
This is my home,you understand

667
00:50:03,023 --> 00:50:08,377
I told you this before,I am in charge here,
you keep that fact straight

668
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:11,352
And I want no lab checks
without my authority

669
00:50:11,352 --> 00:50:13,194
But lab checks is routine

670
00:50:13,194 --> 00:50:15,444
I decide what is routine here

671
00:50:28,704 --> 00:50:30,170
Pathologist,Pearson

672
00:50:32,073 --> 00:50:34,793
Are you sure it is necessary Lucie?

673
00:50:39,153 --> 00:50:41,069
All right.I'll be right up

674
00:51:04,421 --> 00:51:05,162
Here is Dr Pearson

675
00:51:05,904 --> 00:51:07,673
-Lucy
-This is Cathy Hunt

676
00:51:08,113 --> 00:51:10,913
Oh,we have met,
sort of an informal way

677
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:13,166
Every time I see the young
 lady she is giddy

678
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,193
Sure she doesn't have gout

679
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,828
A picture taken at a swimming
 pool some time ago

680
00:51:23,641 --> 00:51:25,823
Let me see both knees please

681
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:32,080
There was water in the pool I believe,
do you enjoy swimming? Do you?

682
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:38,805
Dr Pearson,Dr Pearson what do you think?

683
00:51:39,709 --> 00:51:43,995
I try not to think,Cathy,anymore
than is absolutely necessary

684
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:45,314
X rays here?

685
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:46,927
Two sets,the first didn't show anything

686
00:51:47,487 --> 00:51:50,377
Dr Dell corrected them to
show the soft tissue

687
00:51:50,377 --> 00:51:53,313
 and he confirms the
irregularity in the bones

688
00:52:01,944 --> 00:52:04,215
Cathy you know what a biopsy is,don't you?

689
00:52:05,911 --> 00:52:08,109
Usually to see that it is cancer

690
00:52:09,524 --> 00:52:13,869
But not always Dr Grainger will take a
small piece of tissue from your knee

691
00:52:14,262 --> 00:52:17,668
You won't even have to go to sleep
it is so simple and send it down to me

692
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,930
I'll study it under microscope

693
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:22,839
You wouldn't find anything
Doctor Pearson I felt too well

694
00:52:23,363 --> 00:52:25,347
My knee only hurts once in a while

695
00:52:25,441 --> 00:52:26,680
Of course if anyone find any..

696
00:52:26,731 --> 00:52:30,062
You are an intelligent young woman
and surely you want to know

697
00:52:30,426 --> 00:52:31,940
I told you already do know

698
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:35,105
Cathy it could be result of a swimming pool
 accident

699
00:52:35,105 --> 00:52:36,665
 in which case nothing to worry about

700
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:38,834
Or it could be a bone tumor,

701
00:52:38,834 --> 00:52:41,478
 and even if it is there is every
 likelihood that it is benign

702
00:52:41,876 --> 00:52:43,177
Not cancer,you mean?

703
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,055
Not malignant,yes,but we do have to know

704
00:52:47,844 --> 00:52:49,319
And if it is malignant?

705
00:52:50,015 --> 00:52:51,717
Let me examine it first

706
00:52:51,717 --> 00:52:53,390
-Then we..
-I know

707
00:52:55,112 --> 00:52:58,638
I know you have to amputate,
wouldn't you Dr Grainger?

708
00:52:59,453 --> 00:53:02,063
That's why I will not let you do a biopsy

709
00:53:06,938 --> 00:53:09,300
Because even if it is malignant

710
00:53:13,069 --> 00:53:20,160
I'd rather,anything,anything
 than lose my leg

711
00:53:26,505 --> 00:53:28,402
-Dr Pearson
-Yes

712
00:53:31,076 --> 00:53:33,933
You won't mention this to anyone,will you?

713
00:53:36,995 --> 00:53:37,756
Cathy

714
00:53:38,944 --> 00:53:43,071
I think you should talk this over
with anyone who can make you realize

715
00:53:43,071 --> 00:53:47,199
Promise,Dr Pearson.If you promise,
then I will think it over

716
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:51,634
By myself until Dr Grainger on Monday

717
00:53:52,676 --> 00:53:55,556
Monday is day after tomorrow,
time is important

718
00:53:55,556 --> 00:53:57,799
I'll think it over,I really will,
if you promise

719
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:05,108
All right,I won't mention it
to anyone we know

720
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:08,781
And if you use your head

721
00:54:14,632 --> 00:54:15,893
I handled it before Joe

722
00:54:15,893 --> 00:54:18,027
She has no family, she is of legal age,

723
00:54:18,027 --> 00:54:20,356
and try to see the foolishness
 of losing her leg

724
00:54:20,816 --> 00:54:22,818
I am not good this Lucy,no good

725
00:54:22,818 --> 00:54:25,026
Except more than she is right now

726
00:54:25,468 --> 00:54:27,575
That's why I love this girl,
that's why we all do

727
00:54:28,384 --> 00:54:30,624
We can't wait,the kid got no time to wait

728
00:54:30,624 --> 00:54:33,781
You get that tissue sample down
to me Monday morning,first thing

729
00:54:33,781 --> 00:54:37,420
Not a minute late,it ought
 to be done tonight

730
00:55:39,458 --> 00:55:43,016
Sound.Sunday Vespers

731
00:55:44,904 --> 00:55:47,554
I remember when I was a
child in a very small town

732
00:55:50,517 --> 00:55:52,549
I am glad that I'm not still a child

733
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:53,767
So am I

734
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,874
You do not care anything
about nature,do you?

735
00:55:57,266 --> 00:55:58,838
You haven't even looked

736
00:55:59,674 --> 00:56:01,420
Isn't it lovely?

737
00:56:02,063 --> 00:56:03,666
Lovely is the word

738
00:56:05,118 --> 00:56:10,137
Sometimes everything seems so unbelievable

739
00:56:11,617 --> 00:56:13,246
So beautiful

740
00:56:31,194 --> 00:56:32,395
I am sorry

741
00:56:32,395 --> 00:56:35,958
I guess there must have been a
 smell of fresh air after all I detect

742
00:56:37,421 --> 00:56:39,785
I told you we get away
from people,didn't I?

743
00:56:40,778 --> 00:56:42,923
Now you are stuck with me

744
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:45,568
Far enough away David?

745
00:56:46,077 --> 00:56:48,357
A step in the right direction

746
00:57:11,464 --> 00:57:13,102
What's the matter Cathy

747
00:57:13,102 --> 00:57:15,313
I am sorry,David,I am sorry

748
00:57:15,313 --> 00:57:17,381
It's not you it's me

749
00:57:17,925 --> 00:57:20,144
I'm so tender everything can go on as if

750
00:57:21,194 --> 00:57:23,118
David I don't want to know
 what might have been

751
00:57:23,991 --> 00:57:24,942
Cathy what is it?

752
00:57:26,146 --> 00:57:27,962
Take me back to town,David

753
00:57:31,545 --> 00:57:33,236
Take me back,please

754
00:57:37,278 --> 00:57:38,869
All right,Cathy

755
00:57:44,078 --> 00:57:49,248
Dr Dornberger may have said to walk
but it such a thing taking his advice..

756
00:57:49,771 --> 00:57:52,113
-Hello
-Hello

757
00:57:52,989 --> 00:57:54,435
What's your name?

758
00:57:55,249 --> 00:57:56,530
Elizabeth

759
00:57:57,276 --> 00:57:59,682
My name is Elizabeth too

760
00:58:05,467 --> 00:58:06,603
Take it easy

761
00:58:13,067 --> 00:58:15,313
Alex,too soon.It can't be

762
00:58:15,313 --> 00:58:18,729
You stay right here.I am going to get
a taxi and take you to the hospital

763
00:58:18,729 --> 00:58:20,873
-I don't want
-Stay here

764
00:58:57,572 --> 00:58:59,982
Emergency just telephoned,Charles

765
00:58:59,982 --> 00:59:03,314
The patient arrived ,she is well advanced

766
00:59:04,155 --> 00:59:07,109
This is a premature.Incubator ready?

767
00:59:07,109 --> 00:59:09,044
Yes.It is on its way,Doctor

768
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:49,296
My kid is so small

769
00:59:49,296 --> 00:59:51,830
It wasn't ready for this world,yet

770
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:54,777
Next 6 weeks would have
 made a lot of difference

771
01:00:24,711 --> 01:00:29,878
We'll keep an eye on him,you understand
 his lungs are not fully developed

772
01:00:30,344 --> 01:00:32,213
You see he has not
much of chance,aren't you?

773
01:00:32,953 --> 01:00:36,352
No.What I am saying is,you never can tell

774
01:00:36,352 --> 01:00:40,198
Some babies got the will
to live,fight for life

775
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:46,524
But I don't want to deny it
like some people.They just don't

776
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:49,549
You understand

777
01:00:52,701 --> 01:00:54,029
Thank you doctor

778
01:00:57,692 --> 01:00:59,076
Going up?

779
01:00:59,558 --> 01:01:02,458
That was wrong.Thank you I am sorry.

780
01:01:17,748 --> 01:01:24,039
Dr Pearson.Without disturbing her please
get word to Dr Grangier that I am here

781
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,517
I'll wait until I hear from her

782
01:01:31,638 --> 01:01:32,956
Feeling a bit drowsy Cathy

783
01:01:34,514 --> 01:01:36,737
This won't take long and
 you won't feel a thing

784
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:38,665
Next please

785
01:01:40,712 --> 01:01:44,238
Just stay relaxed,Miss Hunth,
this is just like having a tooth out

786
01:01:45,506 --> 01:01:47,675
I always hated dentists

787
01:01:51,336 --> 01:01:54,395
-Aching Cathy?
-I don't feel a thing

788
01:01:54,395 --> 01:01:58,744
Good girl.Now we take a wedge
 shaped sample of bone

789
01:01:58,744 --> 01:02:01,467
Something between 2-3 cm should be enough

790
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:19,750
You made it in a hurry

791
01:02:20,046 --> 01:02:22,464
Sorry to drag you out in
 this time of the night

792
01:02:23,303 --> 01:02:24,672
-Something important?
-A biopsy

793
01:02:25,037 --> 01:02:27,397
I prepared the slides myself
 I could not locate Bannister

794
01:02:27,397 --> 01:02:30,301
He was probably somewhere else
 pretending to be young

795
01:02:31,288 --> 01:02:33,228
The case,difficult as they come

796
01:02:33,228 --> 01:02:37,876
The surgeon suspects osteogenic sarcoma

797
01:02:37,876 --> 01:02:39,416
What's the rush? Somebody's relatives?

798
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:43,593
No.It's not.Nobody's relative.
Just a patient

799
01:02:46,101 --> 01:02:49,606
All right.Maybe we should work
this faster than every case

800
01:02:55,807 --> 01:02:57,708
Not an easy one

801
01:02:57,708 --> 01:02:59,817
Could be new bone formation

802
01:03:00,598 --> 01:03:04,884
Osteoclastic activity with bands
 of fibrous tissue in between

803
01:03:05,439 --> 01:03:10,405
New bone formation could be the result
of regeneration after a fracture

804
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:14,873
I see now evidence of infection

805
01:03:15,566 --> 01:03:16,349
No

806
01:03:18,987 --> 01:03:21,708
No inflammatory cells in the bone spaces

807
01:03:23,141 --> 01:03:25,146
Did you see any evidence
blood vessel invasion?

808
01:03:25,146 --> 01:03:25,646
Oh No

809
01:03:25,694 --> 01:03:28,859
Then we are back in the new bone formation

810
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:30,631
Borderline case

811
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:32,754
The man could only look in there some sort

812
01:03:32,754 --> 01:03:34,858
of pattern would form of the absolute place

813
01:03:34,858 --> 01:03:36,233
And the X ray?

814
01:03:37,711 --> 01:03:39,349
Shadows and shadows

815
01:03:43,223 --> 01:03:44,800
Radiology says it is up to us

816
01:03:45,757 --> 01:03:48,724
Is this new bone forming
 because it is a neoplasm?

817
01:03:49,428 --> 01:03:53,465
Or is the bone proliferating as a natural
process in response to an injury?

818
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,183
Malignant or benign

819
01:03:57,982 --> 01:03:59,389
Who wants power like this

820
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:08,159
This tumor is malignant as
soon as a surgeon amputates

821
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:11,940
Yes.And if we say it is malignant and we
are wrong

822
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:13,868
the patient loses a leg for nothing

823
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:17,837
But if it is actually malignant
 and there is no operation

824
01:04:18,953 --> 01:04:20,426
Who wants to play God

825
01:04:21,813 --> 01:04:23,630
I had a professor who always warned us

826
01:04:23,636 --> 01:04:26,676
the best we could give in cases
 like these an educated guess

827
01:04:27,345 --> 01:04:28,901
And what is your educated guess here?

828
01:04:28,901 --> 01:04:30,593
I think it is benign

829
01:04:31,848 --> 01:04:33,078
What is you opinion?

830
01:04:35,145 --> 01:04:36,727
I think it is malignant

831
01:04:39,271 --> 01:04:41,150
What about studying some past cases

832
01:04:41,301 --> 01:04:42,826
It would take a week to take them out

833
01:04:43,319 --> 01:04:47,909
-Take them out.What about the cross file?
-We don't have a cross file

834
01:04:48,838 --> 01:04:50,737
Something I've been meaning
 to set up for years

835
01:04:51,877 --> 01:04:54,636
All right.We should have a cross file.
We don't.My fault

836
01:04:55,117 --> 01:04:56,546
Scientific disagreement

837
01:04:57,218 --> 01:05:00,425
Lucy.We always confer this
way in my department

838
01:05:00,425 --> 01:05:01,315
You've met Dr Coleman

839
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:02,443
Oh yes of course

840
01:05:02,483 --> 01:05:04,139
Well.This is one of those nights isn't it

841
01:05:04,139 --> 01:05:06,458
I went home got to bed and
 realized that I couldn't sleep

842
01:05:06,526 --> 01:05:07,510
Here I am

843
01:05:07,907 --> 01:05:08,549
Apologies

844
01:05:08,549 --> 01:05:12,585
Lucy.We don't know,what it comes down to

845
01:05:12,585 --> 01:05:15,589
all these years in medicine
 and we don't know

846
01:05:15,589 --> 01:05:17,747
Dr Pearson said malignant,
there is room for doubts

847
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,274
but I think the tumor is benign

848
01:05:20,017 --> 01:05:23,227
I would not amputate if there
 was any shadow of a doubt

849
01:05:23,414 --> 01:05:25,350
Still I am worried about
 the patient herself

850
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:27,051
Ordinarily I would have waited to morning

851
01:05:27,093 --> 01:05:28,292
To perform a full med biopsy

852
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:31,342
But she was just permission tonight
 so I had to take advantage of that

853
01:05:31,571 --> 01:05:34,028
Now I just don't know how I dare choke at

854
01:05:34,028 --> 01:05:35,950
 it when there is any
doubt one way or another

855
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:39,235
I think I have a solution of sort,Lucy

856
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:41,779
There are two men who are experts
 in this kind of pathology

857
01:05:41,977 --> 01:05:43,358
The patients full name,Dr Grainger

858
01:05:43,358 --> 01:05:45,865
She is one of our student nurses,
you may know her ,Dr Coleman

859
01:05:45,901 --> 01:05:47,274
Cathy Hunt

860
01:05:51,148 --> 01:05:53,472
Yes I know her

861
01:05:54,118 --> 01:05:59,193
Dr Coleman,you have heard of Dr Collingham
 in Boston and Dr Herenhart New York

862
01:06:00,223 --> 01:06:01,983
We'll make two complete set of slides

863
01:06:01,983 --> 01:06:05,030
get them off with air mail special delivery
 and the next mail out of town

864
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:07,045
I'll be warning both doctors
 saying it is urgent

865
01:06:07,045 --> 01:06:09,669
and ask them to telegraph their
 findings as quickly as possible

866
01:06:09,669 --> 01:06:10,995
That will take time

867
01:06:11,897 --> 01:06:12,982
Two days at the most

868
01:06:12,982 --> 01:06:15,470
Every minute counts if you are
 right every second counts

869
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:17,078
Anything I can do,Joe?

870
01:06:17,154 --> 01:06:17,874
Being tight

871
01:06:17,874 --> 01:06:20,010
How do you think I worked
 my way through college?

872
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,579
Cathy?

873
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:54,472
Cathy,I was blind

874
01:06:55,233 --> 01:06:57,381
I would have realized if
 I had not taking up my self

875
01:07:00,704 --> 01:07:01,732
Why didn't you tell me?

876
01:07:03,405 --> 01:07:04,672
Why should I?

877
01:07:05,433 --> 01:07:07,279
You are not involved

878
01:07:23,724 --> 01:07:25,177
You should be sleeping

879
01:07:25,585 --> 01:07:26,540
I can't

880
01:07:27,941 --> 01:07:29,580
Not until I know what's going to happen

881
01:07:30,751 --> 01:07:32,827
Dr Grainger promised to
 let me know in a few hours

882
01:07:32,827 --> 01:07:34,372
Dr Grainger won't know in a few hours

883
01:07:34,438 --> 01:07:37,138
You mean.She promised..

884
01:07:37,138 --> 01:07:38,828
She won't know for two days

885
01:07:42,265 --> 01:07:43,907
I can't understand

886
01:07:44,626 --> 01:07:47,477
Why,do you see,we..we,
can't always know for sure

887
01:07:47,507 --> 01:07:49,868
And Dr Pearson thinks we should
 get a few more opinions

888
01:07:49,868 --> 01:07:51,701
Before

889
01:07:53,767 --> 01:07:55,944
Cathy I feel sure the tissue is benign

890
01:07:59,869 --> 01:08:01,144
Dr Pearson?

891
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:05,185
What does Dr Pearson think?

892
01:08:06,178 --> 01:08:10,109
He,..he doesn't agree

893
01:08:15,912 --> 01:08:17,701
I think

894
01:08:22,069 --> 01:08:24,156
and I'm OK with anyone thinks

895
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:28,386
I don't care about medical opinion

896
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,991
All I know they are not
 going to take off my leg

897
01:08:31,991 --> 01:08:32,863
I won't let them

898
01:08:33,356 --> 01:08:35,259
You have no right to 
make a decision like that

899
01:08:35,367 --> 01:08:35,867
Why not?

900
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:39,308
I can decide how I want to live

901
01:08:40,236 --> 01:08:41,477
and how long

902
01:08:43,311 --> 01:08:44,386
whether

903
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:48,394
Parents are dead it makes no 
difference anyone but me

904
01:08:48,394 --> 01:08:49,359
That's not true

905
01:08:51,744 --> 01:08:54,468
That's no longer true,that's all

906
01:08:57,036 --> 01:08:57,548
David

907
01:09:00,237 --> 01:09:01,368
Please you don't need to..

908
01:09:01,368 --> 01:09:02,514
I do need you

909
01:09:02,577 --> 01:09:06,869
I don't understand it yet,
 but I do need you

910
01:09:21,429 --> 01:09:24,757
You only make everything more complicated

911
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:28,316
more confusing

912
01:09:56,589 --> 01:09:58,091
Let's get this to post office

913
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:12,225
I like this time a man thinks about time

914
01:10:14,202 --> 01:10:16,435
How much we got,
how much we think we got

915
01:10:18,633 --> 01:10:22,674
Even if Lucy amputates,no guarantee
 the girl will live only a year or two

916
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:28,020
or maybe until she dissolves
 as I feel tonight,who knows

917
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:31,548
whoever knows,who has
 any guarantee of time

918
01:10:33,627 --> 01:10:35,949
Either one of us may slip
 in the shower tonight

919
01:10:36,956 --> 01:10:39,180
And we might drop a bomb accidentally

920
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:40,759
or otherwise

921
01:10:42,219 --> 01:10:48,258
or a surgeon makes a simple single slip
 during a routine operation

922
01:10:49,259 --> 01:10:51,667
It happens,it happens

923
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:55,235
If we go along all the time 
thinking we've got forever

924
01:10:56,434 --> 01:10:58,504
Let us have while we have it

925
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,789
Let no anchor leave,
won't have it any longer

926
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:07,137
That won't be a second

927
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:19,595
I'm sorry I should have done that

928
01:11:20,194 --> 01:11:22,589
Why so?Do you think
 I would catch a pneumonia?

929
01:11:24,632 --> 01:11:26,315
Well,let see it in this way

930
01:11:27,086 --> 01:11:28,638
If I gave up the ghost tomorrow,

931
01:11:28,638 --> 01:11:30,849
there is nobody in the world
 that's get then solid damn

932
01:11:31,411 --> 01:11:32,474
or as if you were to die

933
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:35,062
where the devil would that girl be

934
01:11:38,462 --> 01:11:40,745
How long do you think we 
have to wait for the answers

935
01:11:41,511 --> 01:11:44,717
I'll phone Collingham and Herenhart
 tomorrow morning,hurry them up maybe

936
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:51,052
You look like a fellow that 
would do with a drink

937
01:11:52,624 --> 01:11:54,769
I am not proposing we tie 
one on,you understand

938
01:11:54,769 --> 01:12:00,025
Once in a great while mild 
anesthetic is clearly indicated

939
01:12:02,155 --> 01:12:04,912
That's not a prescription,
Dr Coleman,that's an order

940
01:12:51,661 --> 01:12:53,078
Dr Dornberger,what is it?

941
01:12:54,552 --> 01:12:56,707
I don't think it is anything but

942
01:12:56,707 --> 01:12:57,950
I want to double check

943
01:12:57,950 --> 01:13:00,193
You suspect erythroblastosis don't you?

944
01:13:01,467 --> 01:13:03,630
The symptoms are there,yes

945
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:06,497
Why didn't you do a exchange
transfusion at birth?

946
01:13:07,515 --> 01:13:11,786
Dr Alexander,if the lab report on your
 wife's blood test had been positive

947
01:13:11,786 --> 01:13:14,074
we would have exchanged
 the baby's blood at birth

948
01:13:14,074 --> 01:13:18,620
The lab report was negative, an exchange 
transfusion was not necessary

949
01:13:20,543 --> 01:13:22,546
Doctor tell me about my wife's blood test

950
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:25,340
What's this delegation

951
01:13:26,389 --> 01:13:27,559
We'll go on with this later

952
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:31,337
We just came from Alexander's baby

953
01:13:31,337 --> 01:13:35,006
Could we get out the lab report,
I suspect that baby got erythroblastosis

954
01:13:35,006 --> 01:13:35,996
Couldn't be Charlie

955
01:13:36,868 --> 01:13:39,353
I remember you the young
 fellow,the young fiery

956
01:13:39,353 --> 01:13:41,025
Kicked up such storm around here

957
01:13:41,025 --> 01:13:42,338
I just did dispose the test myself

958
01:13:42,378 --> 01:13:43,481
Both tests

959
01:13:43,578 --> 01:13:45,946
Dr Coleman,didn't you agree in
 order to have an accurate

960
01:13:45,946 --> 01:13:48,736
blood sensitization test three
 tests were required

961
01:13:48,736 --> 01:13:50,863
That's right,that's why 
I ordered Coomb serum

962
01:13:50,863 --> 01:13:52,428
I'll check with Bannister

963
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:53,108
Never mind

964
01:13:54,312 --> 01:13:57,990
The indirect Coomb was
 not done on my order

965
01:14:00,058 --> 01:14:01,265
Do I understand you correctly

966
01:14:01,265 --> 01:14:04,913
you mean Mrs Alexander may
 have sensitized blood after all

967
01:14:10,189 --> 01:14:12,200
This means that the baby 
might have erythroblastosis

968
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,142
Could mean that

969
01:14:17,463 --> 01:14:20,714
Bannister,we want a bilirubine every
 six hours on Alexander baby at once

970
01:14:20,714 --> 01:14:22,639
also is there any Coomb 
serum in the hospital?

971
01:14:22,639 --> 01:14:23,531
No Sir

972
01:14:23,556 --> 01:14:25,157
All right.where do we get that half an hour

973
01:14:25,235 --> 01:14:26,708
No time for that,we need to have 
the test somewhere else

974
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:29,097
 where the facilities,university hospitals
 has the full lab

975
01:14:29,114 --> 01:14:31,100
Get me the university hospital,
please and hurry

976
01:14:32,059 --> 01:14:33,621
Also Bannister we need a blood sample

977
01:14:33,988 --> 01:14:35,057
I will

978
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:38,555
Dr Fribe.This Dr Coleman,
Assistant Pathologist,Three Counties

979
01:14:38,555 --> 01:14:40,472
Would you handle an emergency 
Coomb test for us

980
01:14:40,472 --> 01:14:42,869
we'll get the sample to you
 right away,thank you

981
01:14:42,869 --> 01:14:45,196
I would like to take the sample myself

982
01:14:45,275 --> 01:14:47,597
Get it from Bannister take it 
to the emergency ambulance

983
01:14:48,225 --> 01:14:50,433
Could you get me to the 
police department right away

984
01:14:52,147 --> 01:14:55,210
May not be too late for an 
exchange transfusion,Joe

985
01:14:55,545 --> 01:14:57,537
This Dr Dornberger,we would
 like a police car

986
01:14:57,537 --> 01:14:59,059
to deliver an urgent blood sample

987
01:15:00,668 --> 01:15:03,199
Doctor Alexander will be waiting
 at the emergency entrance

988
01:15:03,712 --> 01:15:05,863
Exchange transfusion should 
have been done at birth

989
01:15:06,703 --> 01:15:08,609
If it is not too late no credit to me

990
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,878
Joe

991
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:18,966
To best of my knowledge I have never
 failed a patient to inadequacy or neglect

992
01:15:20,831 --> 01:15:22,193
You made me part of my failure now

993
01:15:24,022 --> 01:15:25,940
We've been friends for a long time,Joe

994
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:30,424
I've covered for you helped 
you to battle upstairs

995
01:15:31,477 --> 01:15:37,638
But this time,if this baby die,
so help me God

996
01:15:37,638 --> 01:15:39,516
I'm going take you before the medical board

997
01:15:39,516 --> 01:15:42,195
and I'm going to break you in two

998
01:16:01,136 --> 01:16:02,319
Listen to me, son

999
01:16:04,558 --> 01:16:05,705
Listen

1000
01:16:06,789 --> 01:16:08,059
Don't give up

1001
01:16:08,988 --> 01:16:12,396
It's worth living,it's worth it

1002
01:16:13,908 --> 01:16:15,525
Don't give up

1003
01:16:18,844 --> 01:16:21,799
This is your father and I love you

1004
01:16:24,223 --> 01:16:25,608
Don't give up

1005
01:16:27,101 --> 01:16:28,552
Don't give up

1006
01:16:37,984 --> 01:16:38,863
Dr Pearson

1007
01:16:42,095 --> 01:16:43,091
Oh,thank you

1008
01:17:00,437 --> 01:17:02,687
Connect me with Dr Grainger please

1009
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:28,068
I am sorry,boy

1010
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:32,483
Lucy I could not tell you on the phone

1011
01:17:32,483 --> 01:17:33,147
No,Joe

1012
01:17:33,147 --> 01:17:35,665
Here the two best men in the country

1013
01:17:36,063 --> 01:17:37,017
Are they definite?

1014
01:17:37,017 --> 01:17:38,517
Oh,yes,both of them,very definite

1015
01:17:38,517 --> 01:17:41,859
Dr Collingham Boston first specimen
 definitely malignant

1016
01:17:44,154 --> 01:17:49,195
Dr Herenhart New York says the tissue
 is benign no sign of malignant

1017
01:17:49,595 --> 01:17:50,849
Right back where we started

1018
01:17:50,849 --> 01:17:52,445
We are not,we lost time

1019
01:17:53,488 --> 01:17:54,458
It's the decision of the pathologist

1020
01:17:54,458 --> 01:17:55,467
Don't tell me use the decision

1021
01:17:55,467 --> 01:17:57,114
don't think I know

1022
01:17:58,156 --> 01:17:59,196
I am sorry,Lucy

1023
01:18:00,915 --> 01:18:01,942
For our training

1024
01:18:03,992 --> 01:18:05,961
All's there and we know nothing

1025
01:18:05,961 --> 01:18:08,347
That's not true,we do not know 
everything,but we know a lot

1026
01:18:08,389 --> 01:18:09,747
More every year

1027
01:18:11,786 --> 01:18:13,649
-Joe?
-I know,I know

1028
01:18:16,668 --> 01:18:19,224
Doctor Coleman,on Sunday night
 you said that in your opinion

1029
01:18:19,224 --> 01:18:22,265
the tumor was benign,do you have 
any reasons to change your mind?

1030
01:18:28,535 --> 01:18:30,474
No,I have no reasons to change my mind

1031
01:18:30,474 --> 01:18:33,696
Doctor Coleman,you are in no position 
to make an objective decision

1032
01:18:34,270 --> 01:18:38,199
Lucy,Doctor Coleman is the 
assistant in this department,

1033
01:18:38,199 --> 01:18:40,386
the final decision is up to me

1034
01:18:40,386 --> 01:18:42,019
All right Joe,whatever you say

1035
01:18:44,839 --> 01:18:46,860
It is a malignant growth

1036
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:49,399
Osteogenic sarcoma

1037
01:18:49,668 --> 01:18:51,004
And it is definite?

1038
01:18:51,633 --> 01:18:52,709
Quite definite

1039
01:18:54,095 --> 01:18:55,232
That's make it difficult,

1040
01:18:55,232 --> 01:18:58,229
I am not sure I can convince the 
girl to allow the operation

1041
01:18:59,035 --> 01:19:01,042
Allow? She has to allow,
doesn't she realize..

1042
01:19:03,777 --> 01:19:05,728
That part is up to me

1043
01:19:21,849 --> 01:19:23,910
-This is a tough one
-They are all tough

1044
01:19:25,032 --> 01:19:26,539
They all already get the tough

1045
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:51,690
I know

1046
01:19:51,946 --> 01:19:54,275
Cathy,whether you want it or not,
you must listen to me

1047
01:19:54,352 --> 01:19:55,305
I don't want to listen

1048
01:19:55,305 --> 01:19:57,671
I just want you to take me away,I mean it

1049
01:19:57,671 --> 01:19:58,705
Just the two of us now

1050
01:19:58,705 --> 01:19:59,628
I can't do that

1051
01:20:00,059 --> 01:20:01,469
If you love me,take me out of here

1052
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:02,971
Don't let them come near me,please

1053
01:20:03,195 --> 01:20:05,344
No deal,Cathy,I love you,but no deal

1054
01:20:05,527 --> 01:20:06,869
I will not let them do it to me

1055
01:20:07,459 --> 01:20:09,233
Listen,you do not want to die,do you?

1056
01:20:10,077 --> 01:20:11,050
I am going to die anyway

1057
01:20:11,050 --> 01:20:12,756
We are all going to die some day

1058
01:20:12,756 --> 01:20:15,919
But soon.Soon if it spreads

1059
01:20:16,018 --> 01:20:18,821
Can you guarantee it not spreads,can you?

1060
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,578
No

1061
01:20:24,075 --> 01:20:25,979
Can you tell me how long
 even if I do let them

1062
01:20:25,979 --> 01:20:28,874
Nobody has no guarantee of time debit

1063
01:20:30,944 --> 01:20:33,861
Anyone of us could get killed tomorrow,
the next day crossing the street

1064
01:20:33,938 --> 01:20:34,891
For no what difference

1065
01:20:35,570 --> 01:20:36,863
Who has difference?

1066
01:20:36,863 --> 01:20:39,438
You are alive.That's the difference

1067
01:20:39,438 --> 01:20:42,639
You are alive now, and that's all you got

1068
01:20:43,315 --> 01:20:44,830
Only any of us can be surer

1069
01:20:45,622 --> 01:20:47,507
We can't be surer of anything else,nothing

1070
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:50,139
Only that we are alive now

1071
01:20:50,918 --> 01:20:53,636
Alive and breathing,and we 
better hang on to it

1072
01:20:54,169 --> 01:20:57,756
Hang on as long as we can 
with whatever means we can

1073
01:20:59,045 --> 01:21:02,027
Hang on and live

1074
01:21:03,915 --> 01:21:05,989
That's why this whole hospital exist

1075
01:21:06,546 --> 01:21:08,025
That's what we are doing here

1076
01:21:08,749 --> 01:21:11,066
Keeping people alive because 
we believe in life

1077
01:21:12,708 --> 01:21:14,255
It's good to be alive

1078
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:20,638
Hope.That's what any poor human being has

1079
01:21:20,638 --> 01:21:22,229
that's all he has

1080
01:21:25,192 --> 01:21:26,827
And it's good

1081
01:21:32,799 --> 01:21:34,916
All right,David.

1082
01:21:37,188 --> 01:21:39,713
All right

1083
01:21:42,788 --> 01:21:43,924
In the aftermath

1084
01:21:46,275 --> 01:21:47,948
When it's over

1085
01:21:49,737 --> 01:21:51,759
Don't come back in here

1086
01:21:53,639 --> 01:21:54,708
Do you understand?

1087
01:21:59,830 --> 01:22:02,538
Don't come back in here

1088
01:22:07,098 --> 01:22:08,706
And hurry please

1089
01:22:12,322 --> 01:22:13,759
I am asleep

1090
01:22:40,033 --> 01:22:45,206
Dr Pearson,it is Alexander.
The blood test is positive.

1091
01:22:47,634 --> 01:22:50,748
Thank you.You hurry back here

1092
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:02,862
Get me Dr Dornberger.
He is on the operating floor,quickly

1093
01:23:06,819 --> 01:23:13,037
Charlie,the Alexander baby 
has erythroblastosis

1094
01:23:16,899 --> 01:23:19,661
The reticulocytes count is high 
we haven't got the bilirubine yet

1095
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:20,569
Never mind I know

1096
01:23:20,569 --> 01:23:22,198
-Is the blood warm?
-Yes ,Doctor

1097
01:23:23,116 --> 01:23:24,910
The hot water bottle in 
the purpose position

1098
01:23:24,910 --> 01:23:26,111
On the table

1099
01:23:27,768 --> 01:23:30,702
It is important that this 
exchange transfusion

1100
01:23:30,919 --> 01:23:34,073
that the blood is in the right temperature,
otherwise it is dangerous for shock

1101
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:36,664
Only the ten sheet of calcium

1102
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:38,706
Temperature

1103
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:40,170

1104
1103
01:23:41,319 --> 01:23:43,737
All right ready to start

1105
01:23:49,136 --> 01:23:51,424
I am cutting off the dry 
portion of the umbilical cord

1106
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,684
Not of the moist tissue

1107
01:24:03,758 --> 01:24:05,376
We have isolated the umbilical vein

1108
01:24:06,297 --> 01:24:07,786
and want to remove the blood clots

1109
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:20,711
Venous pressure

1110
01:24:26,338 --> 01:24:27,515
16mm

1111
01:24:28,948 --> 01:24:30,535
We start going off with the blood

1112
01:24:47,432 --> 01:24:50,793
Do you want to send the 
secretary in for that,Dr Pearson?

1113
01:24:51,424 --> 01:24:53,401
No thanks,Bannister

1114
01:24:56,564 --> 01:24:57,710
Any word yet on the baby?

1115
01:24:58,956 --> 01:25:00,035
Not yet

1116
01:25:31,553 --> 01:25:36,664
Lucy Grainger is taken the Hunt
 girl back to her room for surgery

1117
01:25:39,078 --> 01:25:40,330
What about the Alexander baby?

1118
01:25:41,459 --> 01:25:42,674
Not a word

1119
01:25:57,434 --> 01:25:58,231
Venous pressure

1120
01:26:05,099 --> 01:26:06,064
57mm

1121
01:26:09,282 --> 01:26:10,869
Won't take just a little more

1122
01:26:12,189 --> 01:26:13,419
10cc artery

1123
01:26:24,915 --> 01:26:25,952
10cc again

1124
01:26:48,087 --> 01:26:50,906
Respiration up to 15 rather shallow

1125
01:26:57,591 --> 01:26:58,831
Breathing is very irregular now

1126
01:26:59,873 --> 01:27:01,384
How far are we?

1127
01:27:01,986 --> 01:27:04,019
50 cc is out 50 cc is in

1128
01:27:05,631 --> 01:27:06,846
We'll carry on

1129
01:27:23,631 --> 01:27:26,479
Skin feels cold,Doctor,I can't 
count the respiration

1130
01:27:54,152 --> 01:27:55,263
He is not breathing well

1131
01:28:07,189 --> 01:28:08,394
Check the pulse

1132
01:28:09,069 --> 01:28:10,268
Set the artery pressure

1133
01:28:15,719 --> 01:28:18,501
Pulse is very weak,rate is over 180

1134
01:28:19,196 --> 01:28:20,957
Respiration is failing

1135
01:28:23,676 --> 01:28:25,166
He stopped breathing

1136
01:28:25,485 --> 01:28:26,020
Heart?

1137
01:28:27,038 --> 01:28:27,726
Very faint

1138
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:34,481
Straight over the heart

1139
01:29:14,281 --> 01:29:18,426
My wife,what a temper,she 
still says the bills too high

1140
01:29:18,426 --> 01:29:23,064
She blows her top,I tried to tell
 her he is a specialist this Doc

1141
01:29:23,878 --> 01:29:25,703
After all Doctors are in 
the business,ain’t it

1142
01:29:26,425 --> 01:29:28,432
Just like any other

1143
01:29:32,692 --> 01:29:34,342
What kind of doctor are you going into?

1144
01:29:35,264 --> 01:29:38,916
A general practice in my home town,
there is no doctor there now

1145
01:29:39,794 --> 01:29:41,266
Not get rich that way,pal

1146
01:29:44,744 --> 01:29:46,103
No,I'm not get rich

1147
01:31:23,429 --> 01:31:24,912
Get the oxygen over the tube

1148
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:37,114
Pulse is stronger

1149
01:31:37,777 --> 01:31:38,626
I get it at 140

1150
01:31:52,355 --> 01:31:53,747
We'll go out of the transfusion

1151
01:31:57,841 --> 01:31:58,904
Thanks Bannister

1152
01:32:27,071 --> 01:32:28,400
Pathology Doctor Coleman

1153
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:29,504
Doctor Dornberger tell Joe

1154
01:32:29,504 --> 01:32:35,246
that the Alexander baby survived 
the transfusion prognosis is good

1155
01:32:37,098 --> 01:32:38,397
Thank you ,Dr Dornberger

1156
01:32:55,655 --> 01:32:57,260
The Alexander baby is going to live

1157
01:33:01,225 --> 01:33:03,106
No thanks to me

1158
01:33:03,665 --> 01:33:04,593
You are not resigning?

1159
01:33:06,270 --> 01:33:08,267
You are forgetting who is
 in charge around here

1160
01:33:09,511 --> 01:33:12,277
Why I am not resigning cause 
they won't ask me too hard

1161
01:33:12,277 --> 01:33:13,228
You are needed here

1162
01:33:13,228 --> 01:33:13,954
Not any more

1163
01:33:14,304 --> 01:33:15,619
Boy,don't change on me

1164
01:33:16,978 --> 01:33:18,709
We got sharp eye,sharp mind

1165
01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:22,240
We both knew the minute you 
walked in here this day was coming

1166
01:33:23,357 --> 01:33:24,786
I never intended to..

1167
01:33:24,856 --> 01:33:25,756
Of course you didn't

1168
01:33:27,279 --> 01:33:29,552
I have been trying to figure 
out what I have against you

1169
01:33:30,743 --> 01:33:33,063
Other than your compounded 
personality of course

1170
01:33:34,085 --> 01:33:36,064
I used to think I was 
scared this day coming

1171
01:33:37,015 --> 01:33:41,308
I wasn't that.You made me feel guilty

1172
01:33:42,275 --> 01:33:45,835
Like a fig.I didn't mean"Shut up and listen
 you might learn something"

1173
01:33:47,531 --> 01:33:50,143
You made me feel like a fig,
because you reminded me of

1174
01:33:50,143 --> 01:33:51,750
was myself 30 years ago

1175
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:55,116
cocksure and full of ego nothing
 is too good for medicine

1176
01:33:55,116 --> 01:33:58,546
no room for error,negligence

1177
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:03,115
I was right then and you are right now

1178
01:34:04,641 --> 01:34:06,407
We both know that now,don't we

1179
01:34:10,825 --> 01:34:12,075
Maybe I am not up to it yet

1180
01:34:12,354 --> 01:34:13,914
Don't waste time being humble

1181
01:34:14,710 --> 01:34:16,899
You are good,it won't be easy though

1182
01:34:17,217 --> 01:34:20,713
Your phonery,budgets,over 
budget,committee,meetings

1183
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:22,732
Troubles in the lab which
 needs to be smooth over

1184
01:34:22,732 --> 01:34:25,196
The doctors coming in and out
 asking for this and that

1185
01:34:25,658 --> 01:34:27,633
and the salesman with
 the unbreakable test tube

1186
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:29,237
another,another

1187
01:34:30,142 --> 01:34:32,795
The end of the day you will 
ask what happens to him

1188
01:34:33,913 --> 01:34:35,871
All the fine things we set out to achieve

1189
01:34:36,621 --> 01:34:38,734
Research,study

1190
01:34:39,988 --> 01:34:43,510
The end of the year,all the other years

1191
01:34:52,235 --> 01:34:53,235
Listen to me boy

1192
01:34:58,777 --> 01:34:59,905
Don't let it happen to you

1193
01:35:00,737 --> 01:35:03,170
This would be the advice from 
the best friend you ever have

1194
01:35:04,593 --> 01:35:06,619
Listen. Don't let that happen to you.

1195
01:35:06,619 --> 01:35:10,665
Get away from the phones,the files,
the paperwork and keep yourself upto date

1196
01:35:11,243 --> 01:35:12,867
Lock yourself in a closet if you have to

1197
01:35:13,118 --> 01:35:15,346
But do it,do it

1198
01:35:16,873 --> 01:35:17,817
You follow me?

1199
01:35:19,481 --> 01:35:21,820
Yes,Sir I follow you

1200
01:35:22,662 --> 01:35:28,548
A boy, a girl up there by herself
 she will be waking up soon

1201
01:35:28,992 --> 01:35:30,110
She doesn’t want to see me

1202
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:32,314
Why? For ill judgment?

1203
01:35:32,881 --> 01:35:33,517
She is lying.

1204
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:36,294
Women don't even know when
 they are lying sometimes

1205
01:35:36,691 --> 01:35:37,715
They got to do it

1206
01:35:37,715 --> 01:35:39,595
To keep idiots like you 
and me for understanding

1207
01:35:39,658 --> 01:35:42,827
She knows as well as you do 
that compassion is a part of love

1208
01:35:42,827 --> 01:35:45,296
She is not worried about herself,
how she is loved

1209
01:35:45,296 --> 01:35:46,628
or why,she is worried about you

1210
01:35:46,675 --> 01:35:48,717
She is going to be a cripple
 the rest of her life

1211
01:35:48,744 --> 01:35:50,065
She is trying to spare you

1212
01:35:50,866 --> 01:35:54,396
Listen,all she is thinking of is you
and all your thinking is of her,right?

1213
01:35:55,464 --> 01:35:56,140
You tell me why

1214
01:35:56,644 --> 01:35:59,581
What's love? If it is not thinking of
 somebody else more than yourself

1215
01:36:00,952 --> 01:36:02,018
I can't get through to her

1216
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:04,554
You'll be there when she wakes up

1217
01:36:05,235 --> 01:36:07,427
just be there,that will get through to her

1218
01:36:12,164 --> 01:36:13,237
-Joe
-Yah

1219
01:36:15,947 --> 01:36:20,156
I've just examined the tissue.
You were right.It was definitely malignant

1220
01:36:21,436 --> 01:36:23,980
Dr Grainger hadn't operated she
 would not live six months

1221
01:36:28,986 --> 01:36:30,626
Thanks,David

1222
01:36:32,688 --> 01:36:34,359
What are you doing 
staying around here?

1223
01:36:34,359 --> 01:36:37,266
Look,son,you don't have forever,you know

1224
01:36:37,673 --> 01:36:39,346
You just think so,because you are young

1225
01:36:42,912 --> 01:36:45,226
Thank you,Joe

1226
01:37:09,752 --> 01:37:11,788
Doctor Grainger

1227
01:37:22,551 --> 01:37:23,541
It's me,Cathy

1228
01:37:31,675 --> 01:37:32,942
And I'm staying

1229
01:38:08,461 --> 01:38:13,672
