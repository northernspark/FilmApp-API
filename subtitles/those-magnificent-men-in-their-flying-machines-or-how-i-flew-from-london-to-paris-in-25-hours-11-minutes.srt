<i>Ever since man started to think,
he's wanted to fly.

4
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:36,503
<i>But flying was strictly for the birds...

5
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,357
<i>and continued to be so
for thousands of years.

6
00:00:55,777 --> 00:00:59,933
<i>Man, eternally optimistic, kept trying.

7
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,379
<i>Encouraged by his many successes,
man kept trying.

8
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,936
<i>Through his genius
and his inventiveness...

9
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:58,454
<i>he managed to get his machines
off the ground...

10
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:01,790
<i>and sometimes
he brought them down again.

11
00:03:05,536 --> 00:03:08,121
<i>Bravo! Bravo!

12
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,947
<i>All over the worid,

13
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,082
<i>early pioneers
were making flying history.

14
00:03:17,184 --> 00:03:20,184
<i>And in Italy,
Count Emilio Ponticelli...

15
00:03:20,288 --> 00:03:24,314
<i>made what many people claimed
was the first long-distance flight.

16
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:38,623
<i>There was no doubt about it...

17
00:03:38,721 --> 00:03:42,037
<i>by 1910,
flying had become the rage.

18
00:03:42,144 --> 00:03:43,967
<i>Man had conquered the air...

19
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:46,847
<i>and people everywhere
were all agog about...

20
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:50,523
<i>those magnificent men
in their flying machines.

21
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,487
Hello, Richard!

22
00:06:50,816 --> 00:06:53,566
Oh, Richard!
Oh, Richard, please take me up.

23
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:56,053
Oh, no, not today.
No, it's much too windy.

24
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,982
Come on.
We'll swing her around.

25
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,724
And anyway, strictly speaking,
I'm still on duty. Lift!

26
00:07:01,824 --> 00:07:04,606
It isn't too windy for you to fly.

27
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:06,526
Come on. Give a hand.

28
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:10,447
Oh, Richard, look at that bird.

29
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,581
Oh, Richard, look at that bird.

30
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,390
It can go wherever it likes,
whenever it likes.

31
00:07:15,488 --> 00:07:18,138
- You're so lucky.
- Yes, I know.

32
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,858
Oh, I'd like to soar through the air
and look down on the worid.

33
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,099
Right, let her down.

34
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:28,126
I think I'd make a very nice bird.

35
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:31,290
Yes, I daresay.
Thank you, Carter.

36
00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:35,102
Richard, isn't the rigging a bit tight?

37
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,371
It seems to be stretching the fabric.

38
00:07:37,472 --> 00:07:39,294
You're getting rather good
at noticing things.

39
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,425
- Well, I should jolly well hope so.
- Thank you, Carter.

40
00:07:43,712 --> 00:07:45,752
After all the work
I've done on this contraption.

41
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:47,678
Uh, Patricia...

42
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:50,197
did you get a chance
to talk to your father about my idea?

43
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:53,402
Yes, he's very interested,
but you'll still have to talk to him.

44
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:55,359
Oh, well, I can do that, all right.

45
00:07:55,456 --> 00:07:57,823
Tell him it will increase
the circulation of his newspaper.

46
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,182
Wave the flag.
You know, Britannia rules the sea...

47
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,320
but she doesn't rule the sky,
and all that sort of thing.

48
00:08:03,424 --> 00:08:05,246
Yes, I know exactly what to say.

49
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:08,573
Good.
Then, when he's agreed to your idea...

50
00:08:08,672 --> 00:08:10,941
you're to ask him
if you can take me flying.

51
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,080
Hmm.
Yes, I might.

52
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:15,007
This afternoon?

53
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,007
- All right.
- Oh!

54
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:20,926
Patricia, not now, I'm in uniform.

55
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:24,439
Oh, Richard, don't be so silly.

56
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:30,456
Follow me in your motorcar.
I'll try not to go too fast.

57
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,383
Oh.

58
00:08:49,184 --> 00:08:51,639
- What's the trouble?
- Oh, nothing.

59
00:08:51,744 --> 00:08:54,165
- Father doesn't know about this.
- Oh.

60
00:08:54,272 --> 00:08:56,246
Won't be a minute.

61
00:09:19,744 --> 00:09:23,060
- Well?
- Very nice.

62
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:25,950
You look just like a girl.

63
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:27,870
Thank you.

64
00:09:33,632 --> 00:09:36,087
You know, one of these days,
your father's going to find you out.

65
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:38,102
Mmm, I know.

66
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,794
Exciting, isn't it?

67
00:09:49,504 --> 00:09:50,796
The trouble with aviation today
is that too many good ideas...

68
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:52,087
The trouble with aviation today
is that too many good ideas...

69
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,291
are being dissipated
in too many aeroplanes.

70
00:09:55,392 --> 00:09:58,840
If we could bring together
all these different types
from all over the worid...

71
00:09:58,944 --> 00:10:00,886
then everyone
could learn from each other.

72
00:10:00,992 --> 00:10:02,814
From all over the worid?

73
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:06,141
It's possible, Lord Rawnsley.
The French and the Americans
are well ahead of us.

74
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,476
- I never knew that.
- Well, it's our own fault.

75
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:11,391
Believe it or not, no Englishman flew
until three years ago.

76
00:10:11,488 --> 00:10:13,310
Really?

77
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:17,565
Britannia may rule the waves, sir...

78
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:21,406
but she doesn't rule the skies,
not yet anyway.

79
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:23,773
Have some more Madeira.
Oh, you haven't finished.

80
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:27,734
Damn it.
We should rule the sky.

81
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,742
I can see you're going to be
a real enthusiast, sir.

82
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:32,670
Anytime you should care to come up...

83
00:10:32,768 --> 00:10:35,932
No, thank you, Mays.
I may be an old fogy...

84
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:38,650
but I think that if the Lord
had intended me to fly...

85
00:10:38,752 --> 00:10:41,436
he would have given me... wings.

86
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:45,813
You travel by train, Father,
but you haven't any wheels.

87
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:51,196
Do you really mean no Englishman flew
until three years ago?

88
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:53,597
<i>That's right, sir.

89
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:55,671
Hmm.

90
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:59,963
Come and see me again
in a few days.

91
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:02,814
Meanwhile, I'll discuss your idea
with my circulation people.

92
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,879
Oh, thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

93
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:17,566
Uh, by the by, sir,
there's one other thing.

94
00:11:17,663 --> 00:11:21,460
I wonder if I might take Patricia up
this afternoon.

95
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:23,390
Up? Where?

96
00:11:23,488 --> 00:11:27,416
Oh, into the sky, Father, flying.

97
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,414
Certainly not!
I absolutely forbid you to go up...

98
00:11:32,512 --> 00:11:34,367
and I absolutely forbid you...

99
00:11:34,464 --> 00:11:36,984
to take my daughter flying,
today or any other day.

100
00:11:37,088 --> 00:11:39,641
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

101
00:11:39,743 --> 00:11:43,060
Absolutely, sir.
Thank you, sir.

102
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:58,261
"I absolutely forbid you
to take my daughter flying,
today or any day.

103
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:00,190
- Patricia, darling...
- Is that absolutely understood?"

104
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:03,288
"Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir."
Three bags full, sir!

105
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:05,847
It's not my fault. Now, Patricia,
you can't blame your father...

106
00:12:05,952 --> 00:12:08,407
for thinking that flying is dangerous.
It is.

107
00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:12,025
But when he gets enthusiastic
about the idea, he'll change his mind.

108
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:14,713
Now, you'll see. Oh, Patricia.

109
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:17,237
No, Richard, you're in uniform.

110
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,601
If you won't take me flying,
I shall find someone who will.

111
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:26,711
Oh, all right.

112
00:12:26,816 --> 00:12:29,816
I suppose you wouldn't like to
go have lunch at Windsor?

113
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,294
You could drive the car if you like.

114
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,095
- Me?
- Yes.

115
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,266
Oh! Come on.

116
00:12:45,312 --> 00:12:48,214
Well, that's my idea, gentlemen.

117
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,142
Not a festival but something which
will fire the imagination of the worid...

118
00:12:53,248 --> 00:12:57,143
which will bring together all
the different types of flying machines...

119
00:12:57,247 --> 00:13:01,786
and, at the same time,
increase the circulation of my newspaper.

120
00:13:03,552 --> 00:13:05,374
An air race, gentlemen...

121
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:09,531
<i>initiated, sponsored and rewarded
by the Daily Post.

122
00:13:09,631 --> 00:13:13,210
An air race which will show that
Britannia not only rules the waves...

123
00:13:13,312 --> 00:13:17,469
but intends, in future,
to rule the skies.

124
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:22,456
An air race between the two
most important capitals of the worid...

125
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,855
London and Paris.

126
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:28,318
- But that means flying
across the English Channel.

127
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,799
Well, of course it does.
That's the whole idea, Gascoyne.

128
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:34,271
Well, the French fellow did it last year.

129
00:13:34,368 --> 00:13:36,823
I presume some progress
has been made since then?

130
00:13:36,928 --> 00:13:39,066
- Of course there has, sir.
- Very well.

131
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:41,656
I shall leave the details
to be worked out by my staff...

132
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,859
and you gentlemen
of the Royal Aero Club.

133
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,026
You, Gascoyne,
will be my liaison officer...

134
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,102
an aeronautical correspondent.

135
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:54,136
I shall expect you to go aloft
as often as possible.

136
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,274
Yes, sir. Um, may one ask
what the prize will be, sir?

137
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,099
£10,000.

138
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,778
£10,000?
Most generous, sir.

139
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,247
That should attract fliers
from all over the worid.

140
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,126
That's the idea.
Nevertheless...

141
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:11,420
I shall expect the prize
to be won by an Englishman.

142
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:21,302
"Great London-Paris air race.

143
00:14:21,408 --> 00:14:24,059

That's not bad, eh?

145
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,161
Could you add, um,
"Foreign newspapers, please copy"?

146
00:14:31,264 --> 00:14:33,239
That's already done there
at the bottom of the page.

147
00:14:33,344 --> 00:14:35,254
- Here are some more invitations.
- Good.

148
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,727
You know, between these invitations
and the newspapers...

149
00:14:37,824 --> 00:14:41,271
we should reach every flying man
in the worid.

00:15:36,128 --> 00:15:38,015
<i>- Mon Dieu!
- Dear me.

157
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:43,614
<i>Il est mort!

158
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:52,698
Oh, am I dead, or am I dreaming?

159
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,931
<i>Ah, merveilleuse.
You are so charming.

160
00:15:56,032 --> 00:15:58,421
- What's your name?
- Brigitte.

161
00:15:58,528 --> 00:16:00,862
<i>Brigitte?
Oh, formidable.

162
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,542
Concussión.

163
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,095
Sir.

164
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,877
<i>Monsieur, perhaps it is important.
It's from England.

165
00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:14,909
<i>Nom de chien!

166
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,938
250,000 francs?

167
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,112
- You?
- We must get down the machine.

168
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:23,518
- Yeah, What, me?
- Yes, you. Quick!

169
00:17:10,816 --> 00:17:12,725
Read it, please.

170
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:18,326
"His Imperial Majesty
the Kaiser commands...

171
00:17:18,431 --> 00:17:24,127
"that a German officer wins
the... the London-Paris air race.

172
00:17:24,224 --> 00:17:26,363
You will make arrangements
accordingly."

173
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,192
<i>- Rumpelstrosse.
- Herr Colonel?

174
00:17:31,296 --> 00:17:33,183
Order another flying machine.

175
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:35,865
<i>Jawohl, Herr Colonel,
another flying machine.

176
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:38,171
But there's no one else
who can fly.

177
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:40,094
It cannot be difficult...

178
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,079
otherwise Winkler couldn't have done it.

179
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:47,093
<i>- Not that he was any good at it.
- Of course, Herr Colonel.

180
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,396
<i>- So, Rumpelstrosse.
- Herr Colonel?

181
00:17:50,496 --> 00:17:52,318
You will fly the new machine.

182
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,271
<i>Jawohl, Herr Colonel.

183
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,032
But how will I learn to fly?

184
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:02,452
Same way as we learn everything else
in the German army...

185
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,382
from the book of instructions.

186
00:18:06,527 --> 00:18:08,349
Come on!

187
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:22,294
I don't mind your being interested
in the ladies. That's natural.

188
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:26,742
But it ain't natural to stand up
and wave to them when you fly past them.

189
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:28,735
I lost my head, George.

190
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:32,312
Yeah. You lost most
of my investment too.

191
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:34,423
<i>I told you I could fix it.

192
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:37,211
Maybe we'd better call it a day, Orvil.

193
00:18:37,311 --> 00:18:41,468
Go back to work like ordinary people.

194
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:44,317
George,
you just don't have the flying bug.

195
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:48,125
You don't fly, so you don't know
what it's like up there.

196
00:18:48,223 --> 00:18:50,460
It ain't the going up
that discourages me...

197
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,294
it's the different ways
you keep finding of coming down.

198
00:18:55,391 --> 00:18:59,482
Boy, when you're up there, you get
a sense of freedom and power that...

199
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,780
well, that you just don't get
from anything else.

200
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:06,622
No, sirree.
I'm never gonna give up flying.

201
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,162
Hey, Orvil, look at this.

202
00:19:15,263 --> 00:19:20,250
"London to Paris air race.
First prize... $50,000."

203
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:25,053
- Whoo-ee!
- "For further details, turn to page six."

204
00:19:25,151 --> 00:19:27,039
Whoa!

205
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,907
<i>Somewhere out there is page six.

206
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,982
<i>Where is the great Ponticelli?

207
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,910
Ah! There he is!
There he is over there.

208
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:41,528
Emilio!

209
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:43,606
Emilio, have you heard the news?

210
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:52,569
Papa.

211
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:59,582
Emilio, now you give up flying, huh?

212
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,101
<i>I promise, cara.

213
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:06,201
<i>No more flying.
Finito. Ohh!

214
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:09,435
<i>Emilio, are you all right?

215
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:11,870
Every bone in my body is broken.

216
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:14,553
Emilio, have you seen this?

217
00:20:20,447 --> 00:20:22,270
- Sophia?
- Eh?

218
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:24,604
Look. I shall enter.

219
00:20:24,704 --> 00:20:27,289
<i>I shall win... for Italia.

220
00:20:27,391 --> 00:20:29,530
- But you promised.
- Is postponed.

221
00:20:29,631 --> 00:20:32,599
Come, we go and make-a the plans.

222
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:35,769
I'll buy the best-a flying machine
in the worid.

223
00:20:35,872 --> 00:20:38,905
Like-a Caesar, we go to England!

224
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:41,789
<i>- Bella, Bambini, andiamo!
- Bravo!

225
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:44,821
Bravo! Emilio! Emilio!

226
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,901
Yamamoto!

227
00:21:53,535 --> 00:21:55,640
£10,000.

228
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,163
Just imagine,
do you know we've had 83 entries?

229
00:21:59,263 --> 00:22:01,085
Forty from the continent alone.

230
00:22:01,183 --> 00:22:04,314
Ha! Interest in the race is woridwide.

231
00:22:04,415 --> 00:22:07,415
I really think
it's one of the best ideas I ever had.

232
00:22:08,831 --> 00:22:10,904
Shh!

233
00:22:11,008 --> 00:22:12,830
Your go, Patricia.

234
00:22:18,527 --> 00:22:20,916
Another entry, from Phoenix...

235
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:23,706
- Arizona, milord.
- Arizona.

236
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:25,978
Arizona? Oh.

237
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,624
Well, for someone to come
all that way, must be either
very rich or very confident.

238
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:31,734
Well, as he's American,
he's probably both.

239
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:32,765
<i>I say, there you are!

240
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,879
<i>I say, there you are!

241
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:36,504
You didn't invite that bounder Sir Percy,
did you?

242
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:39,542
- No, of course not.
- Then, what the devil's he doing here?

243
00:22:39,647 --> 00:22:41,470
I don't know.

244
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:43,455
- Hello, Miss Rawnsley.
- Hello.

245
00:22:43,552 --> 00:22:47,348
Rawnsley, Mays.
Just popped in for an entrance form...

246
00:22:47,455 --> 00:22:49,876
for that little junket of yours
to Gay Paree.

247
00:22:49,983 --> 00:22:52,187
If you are referring to
an official entry form...

248
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:56,030
for my London to Paris air race,
my office will send you one.

249
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:59,673
Well, considering the fact that I'm one
of England's foremost aeroplanists...

250
00:22:59,775 --> 00:23:02,076
it's rather jolly inefficient of them
not to send me one before.

251
00:23:02,175 --> 00:23:05,492
I say, excuse me,
if you'll hold your mallet like this...

252
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:07,421
you'll play that shot much better.

253
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,755
I shall hold my mallet
as I've always held my mallet.

254
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,710
In that case, you'll miss the shot.

255
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:16,637
What did I tell you? Missed the shot.

256
00:23:16,735 --> 00:23:19,102
Well, I expect we'll be
seeing you again soon, Sir Percy.

257
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:21,021
- Mm-hmm.
- Glad you're going to join the race.

258
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,021
I'm not only going to join it, dear boy,
I'm going to win it.

259
00:23:24,127 --> 00:23:26,548
Do you really think you have a chance,
Sir Percy?

260
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,542
Miss Rawnsley...

261
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:31,257
I never leave anything to chance.

262
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,722
Hang onto the tail.
I'm revving up. Hang on.

263
00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:24,541
Hey, Orvil, look at that.

264
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:27,160
Wow!
So this is Brookley, huh?

265
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:32,628
- That's what you gotta beat.
- Yeah.

266
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:38,902
- Whoo-ee!
- Oh!

267
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:41,341
Hey, you take over.
I'll be right back.

268
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:44,886
- You all right?
- Yes, of course.

269
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:46,813
Oh, dear.

270
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:51,833
Thank you.
No, no, the other way. This way.

271
00:24:51,935 --> 00:24:54,204
- No, it's the other way.
- Ohh!

272
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,829
- Oh, look what you've done.
- What I've done?

273
00:24:59,935 --> 00:25:02,356
Oh! Haven't you ever seen legs before?

274
00:25:02,463 --> 00:25:04,568
Well, sure I have, lots of times...

275
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:07,933
particularly when you take giris flying
as often as I do...

276
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:09,853
you get to see lots of legs.

277
00:25:09,951 --> 00:25:12,056
And bloomers too.

278
00:25:13,151 --> 00:25:15,039
Oh, but none of them as pretty as yours.

279
00:25:15,135 --> 00:25:18,746
If that's supposed to be a compliment,
I'm not flattered.

280
00:25:20,255 --> 00:25:22,808
Did you say you took giris flying?

281
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:25,278
Well, sure I do, all the time,
only back home.

282
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:27,197
I'm strictly here to race.

283
00:25:27,295 --> 00:25:31,190
- Oh, you're one of the Americans.
- Uh-huh.

284
00:25:31,295 --> 00:25:35,224
Oh, well, that explains everything.

285
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:38,840
- My bicycle, please.
- Oh, sure.

286
00:25:38,943 --> 00:25:40,885
Say, uh, do you work around here?

287
00:25:40,991 --> 00:25:42,966
No. Why?

288
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:45,755
Well, I thought that, uh...

289
00:25:45,855 --> 00:25:47,677
Well, I'd like to see more of you.

290
00:25:47,775 --> 00:25:50,295
You could have worded that better.

291
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:52,287
I'm afraid it's impossible.

292
00:25:52,383 --> 00:25:55,416
I'm not being stuffy,
but we haven't been introduced.

293
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,428
Well, do we have to be?

294
00:25:57,535 --> 00:26:02,390
But of course. English giris
don't care to be picked up.

295
00:26:02,495 --> 00:26:05,910
So, until we are properly introduced...

296
00:26:06,015 --> 00:26:07,837
good-bye.

297
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:26,938
Ah, there you are, Mays.

298
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,105
- Oh, hello, sir.
- I'm glad you're in.
I'll have a word with you.

299
00:26:30,207 --> 00:26:32,346
Oh, certainly, sir.
Inside or out?

300
00:26:32,447 --> 00:26:34,334
Out.

301
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:43,348
Well, I expect you know
what I want to talk to you about.

302
00:26:43,455 --> 00:26:45,277
Oh, yes, sir, the race, of course.

303
00:26:45,374 --> 00:26:48,822
No, no, not the race... Patricia.

304
00:26:48,927 --> 00:26:51,774
She's getting rather keen on you.

305
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:54,108
Oh.

306
00:26:54,207 --> 00:26:57,884
Well, are you intending
to propose to her?

307
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,805
Well, with your permissión, sir.

308
00:26:59,903 --> 00:27:02,586
My dear fellow,
you can take that for granted.

309
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,370
Your father was at school with me.

310
00:27:08,414 --> 00:27:10,520
There's just one snag, sir.

311
00:27:10,623 --> 00:27:12,445
Oh?

312
00:27:12,543 --> 00:27:15,674
- It's finding the time for married life.
- What do you mean?

313
00:27:15,775 --> 00:27:19,485
Well, I'm soldiering all day,
and I'm rather busy in the evenings too.

314
00:27:19,582 --> 00:27:23,194
Monday I dine in.
Tuesday's card night at White's.

315
00:27:23,295 --> 00:27:25,466
Wednesday I play snook with the adjutant.

316
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:29,211
Thursday, uh, well,
we like to end up at Romano's.

317
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:31,133
Uh, that only leaves Friday.

318
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:33,686
Yes, but what about the weekends?

319
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:37,271
Well, that's flying, sir.
It's the only time I've got.

320
00:27:39,871 --> 00:27:42,238
But I could give up my card night
if you like, sir.

321
00:27:42,335 --> 00:27:45,433
Oh, I don't think that's necessary.
We don't want to spoil the girl.

322
00:27:45,535 --> 00:27:47,390
You do love her, don't you?

323
00:27:47,487 --> 00:27:50,072
- Oh, I do, sir, very much.
- I thought you did.

324
00:27:50,175 --> 00:27:54,070
Well, glad to have had this little talk.
Nice to know you're serious.

325
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:57,437
So few young people are these days.

326
00:27:57,535 --> 00:27:59,357
Good-bye.

327
00:28:01,727 --> 00:28:03,549
Good-bye, sir.

328
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,654
Well, over there are the hangars.

329
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:14,134
When you get delivery of your plane,
you will put it in the one nearest us.

330
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:17,556
First-a class for a first-a class plane.
Wait till you see it.

331
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:20,630
Oh, my darling, it's-a wonderful.

332
00:28:20,735 --> 00:28:22,873
I'm going to be very happy here.

333
00:28:22,975 --> 00:28:25,658
And I'm very happy for you too.

334
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,734
What is all that water?

335
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,701
<i>Actually, it's the sewage farm.
- What is sewage?

336
00:28:31,807 --> 00:28:34,938
Actually, it's rather nasty, really.
Drains and all that.

337
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,886
Jolly useful. Most of the pilots
crash over there sometimes...

338
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:41,212
- Crash?
- They don't consider themselves
aeroplaners until they have.

339
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:43,133
- Oh, oh.
- Well, now, uh...

340
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:45,980
you'll want to know
all about the practice times.

341
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:48,316
You are scheduled
for 7:30 in the morning...

342
00:28:48,415 --> 00:28:50,237
and 4:00 in the afternoon.

343
00:28:50,335 --> 00:28:54,612
- Ah, first-a class.
- You'll be following the French.

344
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:58,494
I no follow any Frenchman.
Italy come-a first or no come at all.

345
00:28:58,591 --> 00:29:02,006
<i>We go! Finito.
Andiam'a casa. Andiamo.

346
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:06,141
Sir! Sir! I say, sir! Sir!

347
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:09,021
Sir, if you feel so strongly about it,
sir, you can go before the French.

348
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:13,630
I can?

349
00:29:13,726 --> 00:29:15,581
- First-a class.
- Okay, steady on.

350
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,646
Sophia, we go before the French.

351
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:21,620
<i>- Who is this?
- It's Lord Rawnsley.

352
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,501
Ah. This is the English milord.

353
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,014
Good morning, milord!

354
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:31,126
Good heavens.
He's brought his entire family.

355
00:29:31,231 --> 00:29:33,467
- Who is he?
- Emilio Ponticelli.

356
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:35,389
Richard says he's not only a great pilot...

357
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:37,462
he's one of the richest chaps in Italy.

358
00:29:37,566 --> 00:29:39,574
Never stops buying flying machines.

359
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,941
<i>A great enthusiast for everything.

360
00:29:49,887 --> 00:29:52,986
- Morning, milord.
- Morning, sir!

361
00:29:53,086 --> 00:29:56,250
Righto, lads.
Heave-ho, onto the field.

362
00:30:07,615 --> 00:30:09,851
<i>Achtung!

363
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:36,377
Brigitte!
Oh, wonderful!

364
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:38,650
Every time I see you, my heart sings.

365
00:30:38,751 --> 00:30:41,785
Brigitte, no. Ingrid.
I am Swedish.

366
00:30:41,886 --> 00:30:43,708
<i>- Swedish?
- Ja.

367
00:30:43,806 --> 00:30:46,523
- But didn't I see you
on the beach in Normandy?
- It's possible.

368
00:30:46,623 --> 00:30:48,859
Come.
Come and teach me to fly.

369
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,838
Oh!

370
00:30:57,854 --> 00:31:00,538
Oh!

371
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:03,802
Look, Father!
He's teaching her to fly!

372
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:07,929
How ridiculous.
Anyone can see that young woman
isn't in the least mechanically minded.

373
00:31:08,031 --> 00:31:11,544
- Good heavens, what's that?
- Does 35 miles an hour!

374
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:15,678
Wingspan of 30 feet!

375
00:31:15,775 --> 00:31:19,288
Now, when you get up
to about 40 flaps a minute...

376
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,496
use the top power and you're away!

377
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:23,421
You are sure it will fly?

378
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,105
Of course it'll fly! What do you
think it's gonna do, lay an egg?

379
00:31:26,206 --> 00:31:29,818
This has the power of an eagle,
the... the grace of a swan.

380
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,253
- And it's a bargain for 350 guineas.
- Emilio!

381
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:34,490
Don't-a worry.
It's-a going to be first-a class!

382
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,412
Put it on for me, please!

383
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:39,128
No, I don't want that.
Is guaranteed.

384
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,304
Emilio, put it on for me, please!

385
00:31:41,406 --> 00:31:43,992
Ah, Sophia.

386
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,517
Eh.

387
00:31:53,151 --> 00:31:55,158
All right!

388
00:31:55,262 --> 00:31:57,117
Take it away!

389
00:32:13,887 --> 00:32:17,051
Up! Up! Up!

390
00:32:23,487 --> 00:32:25,047
Up! Up!

391
00:32:30,751 --> 00:32:32,212
Oh, God.

392
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,691
Oh, well, we all make mistakes.

393
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,849
Easy with her.

394
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:49,592
- Watch the tail skid, Charlie.
- Right.

395
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:54,909
Morning, sir.

396
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:57,462
Morning, madam.

397
00:32:57,566 --> 00:32:59,738
Morning, Sir Percy.

398
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,572
I hope your hands are clean.

399
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,374
<i>Come on, Courtney!

400
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:14,780
- Switch is off, sir?
- Switch is off, Courtney.

401
00:33:16,446 --> 00:33:18,333
- Switch is on, sir?
- Switch is on, Courtney.

402
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,535
Contact, sir?

403
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:23,127
Contact, Courtney.

404
00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:34,166
Come on, Courtney, you lazy loafer!

405
00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:38,068
Hang on! I haven't revved up yet!
Useless lot!

406
00:33:39,646 --> 00:33:42,134
You! Yes, you! Go and stand over there!

407
00:33:42,238 --> 00:33:44,605
Give my chaps a hand, will you?

408
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:09,084
He's not supposed to carry passengers.

409
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,965
Ooh, heck.

410
00:34:20,607 --> 00:34:24,219
Stand by, lads!
It's Sir Percy!

411
00:34:25,759 --> 00:34:28,476
Make for the sewage farm!

412
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:54,493
Uhh! Oh! Buzz off!

413
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:00,347
What the hell are you doing?

414
00:35:00,446 --> 00:35:03,742
Whoo, that's my toe!
Get your backside out of my face!

415
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:06,326
What the hell are you doing down there?

416
00:35:10,431 --> 00:35:12,471
I can't land the plane!

417
00:35:35,935 --> 00:35:38,106
Back to the sewage farm!

418
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:47,348
- He's gonna crash!
- Yeah.

419
00:36:05,087 --> 00:36:07,705
You bounder!
Look what you've done to my aeroplane!

420
00:36:07,806 --> 00:36:09,629
I'll kill you! Aaah!

421
00:36:26,111 --> 00:36:28,347
- Come on, Courtney! Get on!
- Ooh!

422
00:36:35,134 --> 00:36:38,004
<i>Achtung! Halt!

423
00:37:27,134 --> 00:37:29,436
Is this where
the Yankee fellow hangs out?

424
00:37:29,534 --> 00:37:31,356
Yes, governor, this is the place.

425
00:37:31,454 --> 00:37:34,269
Are you quite certain
he's smaller than me?

426
00:37:34,366 --> 00:37:36,701
- Oh, yes, governor.
- Right.

427
00:37:36,799 --> 00:37:38,621
Stay there.

428
00:37:40,222 --> 00:37:42,295
Hey, you there, Yankee chap.

429
00:37:43,934 --> 00:37:45,789
Oh, howdy.

430
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:50,585
<i>- Did you want me?
- I certainly do.

431
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:53,337
You caused me to crash
my flying machine.

432
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,827
I therefore intend
giving you a jolly good thrashing.

433
00:37:55,934 --> 00:37:57,756
- Ready?
- Ready.

434
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:05,363
I suppose you think that's funny.

435
00:38:06,846 --> 00:38:09,235
- Well, pardon me.
- Eh?

436
00:38:09,343 --> 00:38:11,710
You might wanna
thrash someone else with this.

437
00:38:11,806 --> 00:38:13,629
Yes.

438
00:38:16,254 --> 00:38:18,360
Got a cold, governor?

439
00:38:28,318 --> 00:38:30,140
# Ooh-ooh #

440
00:38:30,238 --> 00:38:32,060
You're late.

441
00:38:37,662 --> 00:38:40,597
Ooh, Richard.
Ooh, you taste of castor oil.

442
00:38:40,702 --> 00:38:42,524
Eww.

443
00:38:44,478 --> 00:38:46,998
Did you fix the extra petrol tank?

444
00:38:47,102 --> 00:38:49,622
Yes. And changed the oil.

445
00:38:49,726 --> 00:38:51,548
Did need changing.
You were quite right.

446
00:38:51,646 --> 00:38:54,493
Of course. I'm always right.

447
00:38:56,862 --> 00:39:01,499
And now you're going to help me
grease the undercarriage.

448
00:39:01,598 --> 00:39:04,216
- Whoops!
- Now, come on.

449
00:39:06,142 --> 00:39:08,924
Right.
You begin greasing here.

450
00:39:09,022 --> 00:39:11,477
On the axle?

451
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,721
Mmm, it could do with it.

452
00:39:19,294 --> 00:39:22,328
Say, you've really got yourself
something here, don't you?

453
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:25,943
- Anything I can do for you?
- Well, I was, uh...

454
00:39:26,046 --> 00:39:29,307
I was hoping that you might let me
borrow a monkey wrench from you.

455
00:39:29,406 --> 00:39:31,740
Monkey wrench?

456
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:34,108
Oh. Well, I can let you have
an adjustable spanner
if that's what you mean.

457
00:39:34,142 --> 00:39:36,379
Oh. Well, I can let you have
an adjustable spanner
if that's what you mean.

458
00:39:36,478 --> 00:39:38,420
Well, I guess
that's what they call it in England.

459
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:41,980
- You're Orvil Newton, aren't you?
- That's right.

460
00:39:42,078 --> 00:39:44,020
- I'm Richard Mays.
- Howdy-do.

461
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,510
I'll get it for you.

462
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:55,828
Oh. May I present
Miss Patricia Rawnsley?

463
00:39:55,934 --> 00:39:57,822
Well, howdy-do.

464
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:04,852
Now, wouldn't you say
this constitutes a formal introduction?

465
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:07,773
Well, y-yes, I suppose so.

466
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,179
<i>Do you have to do that
every time we meet?

467
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,183
Oh, please.

468
00:40:16,286 --> 00:40:18,108
Well, I... Go on.

469
00:40:18,206 --> 00:40:20,028
Hurry up!

470
00:40:27,774 --> 00:40:29,879
Thank you!

471
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:35,860
Your monkey wrench, Mr. Newton.

472
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,355
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

473
00:40:38,462 --> 00:40:41,113
I'll bring it back just as soon
as I'm through with it.

474
00:40:46,206 --> 00:40:48,028
Where'd you meet that fellow?

475
00:40:48,126 --> 00:40:50,231
Oh, I... I met him here.

476
00:40:50,334 --> 00:40:53,978
Oh. Good-looking chap, isn't he?

477
00:40:54,078 --> 00:40:57,394
Is he?
Oh, I-I didn't notice.

478
00:40:58,686 --> 00:41:00,726
Come on, Richard.
On with the greasing.

479
00:41:03,038 --> 00:41:05,886
Oh, thanks, dear.

480
00:41:05,982 --> 00:41:08,830
Here. Just a wee dram
to warm me up a bit, eh?

481
00:41:16,478 --> 00:41:18,267
Oh!

482
00:41:18,366 --> 00:41:20,188
Ingrid!
You are working here.

483
00:41:20,286 --> 00:41:22,228
My name is Marlene.
I'm German.

484
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:24,636
But I've met you somewhere before,
I'm sure.

485
00:41:24,734 --> 00:41:28,727
- Oh, it is possible.
- Oh, never mind. We have met now.

486
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:32,059
And I would like you
to know I adore Germans.

487
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,394
Howdy. May I sit down?

488
00:41:42,494 --> 00:41:46,422
Let me make quite sure
my skirt is out of the way first.

489
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,372
How is the food?

490
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,772
Everything's off
but the chop and chips.

491
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:54,804
Oh. Well, uh,
well, that's what I'll have then.

492
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,732
Can I order you anything?

493
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,285
Oh, no... no, thank you.
I'm just going.

494
00:42:10,142 --> 00:42:12,215
Not bad, huh?

495
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:15,035
Oh. Oh, yes.
It's a very beautiful aeroplane.

496
00:42:15,134 --> 00:42:17,752
- No, I meant me.
- Oh!

497
00:42:17,854 --> 00:42:20,090
- Oh, is that you? Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

498
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:22,329
Well, I don't normally
carry my photograph around.

499
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:24,765
<i>It's just that, uh, well,
Mr. Gascoyne of the Daily Post...

500
00:42:24,862 --> 00:42:27,229
well, he wanted it, you see.

501
00:42:27,326 --> 00:42:29,366
Oh, uh, please begin.

502
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:32,918
That's a Wright biplane, isn't it?

503
00:42:33,022 --> 00:42:36,284
- No, that's a Curtis.
- Oh.

504
00:42:36,382 --> 00:42:38,236
Is that the one
you take passengers up in?

505
00:42:38,334 --> 00:42:43,320
Mm-hmm.
It's got an Anzani engine in it,
developing 70 horsepower.

506
00:42:43,422 --> 00:42:45,244
And you brought it
all the way from Arizona.

507
00:42:45,342 --> 00:42:48,025
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, you must be very rich.

508
00:42:48,126 --> 00:42:49,981
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,
ma'am...

509
00:42:50,078 --> 00:42:52,925
but we came all the way across
by cattle boat.

510
00:42:53,022 --> 00:42:55,640
We're in hock way up to our eyebrows.

511
00:42:55,742 --> 00:42:59,833
Now, if I don't win that race,
I'm going to lose my plane
and everything.

512
00:43:06,206 --> 00:43:08,955
Say, do you know
that you are very beautiful?

513
00:43:10,014 --> 00:43:11,836
Oh, yes,
I know I am.

514
00:43:11,934 --> 00:43:15,065
I also have a very good figure,
I'm rich...

515
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:18,101
and I'm in love
with an extremely handsome man.

516
00:43:18,206 --> 00:43:21,370
Mmm.
Is he in love with you?

517
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,925
- Well, I think so.
- Well, hasn't he told you?

518
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:27,510
Well, no.
No, not exactly.

519
00:43:27,613 --> 00:43:29,785
I mean, yes.
Yes, he has.

520
00:43:29,885 --> 00:43:33,628
- Hmm.
- Well, let's talk about you.

521
00:43:33,725 --> 00:43:36,027
All right. What do you
want to know about me?

522
00:43:36,126 --> 00:43:38,493
Would you take me up?

523
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:41,175
Well, sure. Anytime.

524
00:43:44,478 --> 00:43:46,300
T- Tomorrow?

525
00:43:46,398 --> 00:43:49,365
All right.
First thing in the morning, huh?

526
00:43:53,502 --> 00:43:57,331
Say, um,
you have flown before, haven't you?

527
00:43:58,558 --> 00:44:01,111
Yes. Yes.

528
00:44:01,213 --> 00:44:03,101
Hundreds of times.

529
00:44:03,198 --> 00:44:06,132
Well, l... I just love it. L...

530
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:11,357
Oh, I have to go now.
Until tomorrow then.

531
00:44:11,454 --> 00:44:13,691
I'll be looking forward
to seeing you outside my hangar.

532
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:16,027
<i>- Yes.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

533
00:44:16,126 --> 00:44:18,133
I've brought the car to the door.

534
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,061
Been sitting with that American,
have you?

535
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:24,250
Yes. He was telling me
all about Arizona.

536
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:26,172
Oh, you were quite right,
Richard...

537
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:28,921
he is very good-looking.

538
00:44:32,158 --> 00:44:34,329
Well, I didn't fancy
the way he was looking at you.

539
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:37,179
Richard, I do believe you're jealous.

540
00:44:37,278 --> 00:44:39,547
Me, jealous?
I've never been jealous in my life.

541
00:44:39,646 --> 00:44:43,029
If I catch him
looking at you again like that...

542
00:44:43,134 --> 00:44:44,956
I'll give him a good hiding.

543
00:44:45,054 --> 00:44:47,323
Oh, don't be so pompous.

544
00:45:16,701 --> 00:45:18,905
Who's first off this morning, Courtney?

545
00:45:19,006 --> 00:45:21,340
Mr. Dubois, sir.

546
00:45:21,438 --> 00:45:23,348
Oh, he's one of the dangers.

547
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:27,513
I know, sir. He's got a better
flying machine than you have.

548
00:45:27,613 --> 00:45:29,436
I don't admit that.

549
00:45:29,533 --> 00:45:31,835
But if he has,
it'll have to be nobbled.

550
00:45:31,934 --> 00:45:34,203
You're not going...

551
00:45:34,302 --> 00:45:36,342
You're not going to sabotage it,
governor?

552
00:45:36,446 --> 00:45:39,762
<i>I certainly am not.
You are.

553
00:45:42,654 --> 00:45:44,541
Get back. Get back.

554
00:45:52,062 --> 00:45:54,364
<i>Bonne chance, Pierre!

555
00:45:54,462 --> 00:45:56,829
- Okay!
- Bon voyage, Pierre!

556
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:09,943
I think the Frenchy's taking off.

557
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,092
- Shall I call the lads out?
- No.

558
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:20,151
It's a lovely day. He'll be all right.
He knows what he's doing.

559
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:44,506
You all right, Chief?

560
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:49,976
<i>Halt!

561
00:46:54,046 --> 00:46:56,185
<i>Today we fly, Herr Rumpelstrosse.

562
00:46:56,285 --> 00:46:58,740
You will taxi across the field,
take off...

563
00:46:58,846 --> 00:47:01,082
fly one circle and return.

564
00:47:01,182 --> 00:47:04,565
<i>Understood, Herr Colonel.
Taxi across the field, take off,
fly one... Aaah!

565
00:47:08,734 --> 00:47:12,563
Oh! Aaah!

566
00:47:14,814 --> 00:47:16,701
<i>Ach, Schweinehund!

567
00:47:16,798 --> 00:47:19,700
Take up your flying machine
at once...

568
00:47:19,806 --> 00:47:24,083
and show those French idiots
what a German officer can do!

569
00:47:24,189 --> 00:47:27,004
Jawohl, Herr Colonel.

570
00:47:55,198 --> 00:47:57,086
On the double!

571
00:48:00,894 --> 00:48:03,447
<i>Eins, zwei, drei!

572
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:12,725
Rumpelstrosse!
Come back!

573
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:16,092
<i>Herr Rumpelstrosse!

574
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:24,861
Rumpelstrosse, you fool!
Stop playing the games!

575
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:26,813
Aaah!

576
00:48:29,565 --> 00:48:31,354
How can I stop this damn thing?

577
00:48:35,325 --> 00:48:37,300
Get out of the way!
I can't stop!

578
00:48:45,502 --> 00:48:49,396
Oh, go away!
Idiotic instructions!

579
00:48:49,502 --> 00:48:51,389
Stop in the name of the... Oh!

580
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:56,089
Come back here!

581
00:48:58,109 --> 00:49:01,076
Hey! Just a minute!
Here! Here, what...

582
00:49:08,958 --> 00:49:11,675
- Go faster!
- Put your foot down!

583
00:49:30,974 --> 00:49:33,210
Leave my fire engine alone!

584
00:49:53,118 --> 00:49:57,111
- Hey! No!
- Look out!

585
00:50:05,598 --> 00:50:08,151
<i>Where's that flying machine from?

586
00:50:08,253 --> 00:50:10,141
<i>Somebody do something!

587
00:50:16,702 --> 00:50:19,833
<i>Herr Rumpelstrosse, no!
Not again! Aaah!

588
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:24,157
<i>Hey, Orvil, where you going?

589
00:50:24,253 --> 00:50:27,450
Orvil, you're supposed to be practicing!

590
00:50:39,038 --> 00:50:41,012
Follow that flying machine!

591
00:50:44,669 --> 00:50:47,058
<i>Herr Colonel, what shall I do now?

592
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:50,297
- Look in the book, fool!
- I already did so!

593
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:59,612
- What's he trying to do?
- Stop it, I suppose.

594
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:02,011
Oh, isn't he brave?

595
00:51:04,189 --> 00:51:07,157
Oh, well done!
Whoops!

596
00:51:16,509 --> 00:51:18,778
Oh!

597
00:51:18,877 --> 00:51:20,917
We're heading for the wall!

598
00:51:21,022 --> 00:51:22,964
Come on!
We gotta jump off!

599
00:51:24,701 --> 00:51:26,524
Stop! Stop!
Stop the plane!

600
00:51:26,621 --> 00:51:29,850
- He's stopped him!
- Hear! Three cheers for the American!

601
00:51:29,949 --> 00:51:32,404
<i>- Hey, Orvil, have you gone crazy?

602
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:34,332
- What do you think you're doing?
- Somebody had to.

603
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:36,252
You're supposed to be flying!

604
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:39,067
Hey, put that man down! You hear me?

605
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:41,533
Bravo, Orvil!
Well done!

606
00:51:41,629 --> 00:51:43,734
<i>- It's another German!
- Can't stop!

607
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:48,408
Rumpelstrosse!

608
00:51:49,597 --> 00:51:51,419
<i>Herr Colonel!
Come back!

609
00:51:51,517 --> 00:51:53,972
Rumpelstrosse, save me!

00:51:55,165 --> 00:51:57,238
Rumpelstrosse!

611
00:51:59,165 --> 00:52:01,686
- Rumpelstrosse!
- Hang on! Hang on!

612
00:52:13,405 --> 00:52:17,628
Hey, Orvil, what you doing? What's that
contraption you're sticking on there?

613
00:52:17,726 --> 00:52:21,141
It's a scoop. Produces more pressure
up in the engine.

614
00:52:21,245 --> 00:52:24,344
Yeah, well it might blow up the engine.
Ever think of that?

615
00:52:24,446 --> 00:52:28,188
- You ever think that cigar might too?
- Mmm. Ah.

616
00:52:28,286 --> 00:52:31,068
No, I need the speed.
All these monoplanes around here...

617
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:33,621
are a lot faster than this old buzzard.

618
00:52:33,725 --> 00:52:35,548
Since we've been here,
I been looking around...

619
00:52:35,645 --> 00:52:37,468
getting some new ideas.

620
00:52:37,565 --> 00:52:38,710
Yeah.

621
00:52:38,813 --> 00:52:41,431
Um, may I come in?

622
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,573
Oh. Well, how do you do?

623
00:52:48,381 --> 00:52:50,934
Boy, you sure are pretty.

624
00:52:51,037 --> 00:52:54,747
I, uh... I waited as long
as I could this morning.

625
00:52:54,845 --> 00:52:56,918
Oh, I wanted to apologize...

626
00:52:57,021 --> 00:52:59,477
but I just couldn't get away.

627
00:52:59,581 --> 00:53:02,363
- Why not?
- My father insisted on coming down...

628
00:53:02,461 --> 00:53:04,283
to watch everyone practice.

629
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:06,683
What's he got to do with it?

630
00:53:06,782 --> 00:53:10,197
- He's Lord Rawnsley.
- Lord who?

631
00:53:10,301 --> 00:53:12,756
- Oh! Didn't you know?
- No.

632
00:53:12,861 --> 00:53:15,643
<i>But this is his race.

633
00:53:15,741 --> 00:53:20,181
Ha! Well, I guess he's got every right
in the worid to watch it then, huh?

634
00:53:21,342 --> 00:53:23,316
Oh, I get it.

635
00:53:23,421 --> 00:53:26,421
Well, he won't allow you to...
to fly, will he?

636
00:53:27,613 --> 00:53:30,362
Hmm. What'd you ask me
to take you up for then?

637
00:53:30,461 --> 00:53:32,600
You want me
kicked out of the race?

638
00:53:32,702 --> 00:53:35,931
Why didn't you ask that fellow
you're supposed to be in love with
to take you up?

639
00:53:36,029 --> 00:53:39,739
Oh, I couldn't. He gave my father
his word that he wouldn't.

640
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:41,660
Richard's a man of principle.

641
00:53:41,758 --> 00:53:43,994
Oh, yeah?

642
00:53:44,093 --> 00:53:47,442
I asked you to take me flying...

643
00:53:47,549 --> 00:53:49,404
because I like you.

644
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:53,365
Oh?

645
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:55,412
I like you very much.

646
00:53:57,757 --> 00:53:59,797
And I'm dying to fly!

647
00:54:03,037 --> 00:54:05,590
Well, I have to go now.

648
00:54:05,693 --> 00:54:08,857
Just a second.
Look, I'm going all out to win.

649
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:10,867
Now, do you think I have a chance?

650
00:54:10,973 --> 00:54:14,356
Well, that's entirely up to you.

651
00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:18,716
Isn't it?

652
00:54:18,813 --> 00:54:21,912
Well, yeah.
I guess it is.

653
00:54:24,893 --> 00:54:27,422
I'll see you tomorrow at Dover.

654
00:54:27,678 --> 00:54:30,133
Those are the rules, gentlemen.
Now for the route.

655
00:54:30,237 --> 00:54:33,336
First day, first leg...
London to Dover.

656
00:54:33,438 --> 00:54:36,754
Emergency landing fields here,
here and here.

657
00:54:36,861 --> 00:54:39,895
First aid stations here,
here and here.

658
00:54:39,997 --> 00:54:43,346
Refueling points here and here.

659
00:54:43,453 --> 00:54:45,275
What is all this fuss about?

660
00:54:45,373 --> 00:54:48,155
Why do we have to go to Dover by road?
Why can't we fly?

661
00:54:48,253 --> 00:54:51,831
Good heavens! You can't expect
these machines to fly 62 miles nonstop!

662
00:54:51,934 --> 00:54:53,756
You've got to reconnoiter by road.

663
00:54:53,854 --> 00:54:56,374
None of you foreigners know
which railway lines to follow anyway!

664
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:01,016
On my left, landmark number seven.

665
00:55:02,269 --> 00:55:05,586
The level crossing
five miles west ofTunbridge.

666
00:55:05,693 --> 00:55:07,668
Mark it on your maps, gentlemen...

667
00:55:07,773 --> 00:55:10,293
and follow the railway line to Dover.

668
00:55:15,773 --> 00:55:18,010
<i>It's a hell of a long way
to the other side.

669
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:20,892
- Yeah. What do you think?
- I don't know. What do you think?

670
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:22,812
Can you swim?

671
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:24,732
Look!
You can see France.

672
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:27,099
Yes, but there's
an awful lot of water in-between.

673
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:30,492
<i>It is impossible to cross,
Herr Colonel.

674
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:32,859
Nothing is impossible
for the fatherland.

675
00:55:37,054 --> 00:55:39,956
Aren't you afraid of getting "drownded,"
governor?

676
00:55:41,469 --> 00:55:43,608
Sorry to disappoint you, Courtney.

677
00:55:43,709 --> 00:55:47,451
If anybody's going to get his feet wet,
it isn't going to be me.

678
00:55:47,549 --> 00:55:49,371
Uh, I say.

679
00:55:49,469 --> 00:55:51,771
<i>Pardon.
Uh, pardon moi, monsieur.

680
00:55:51,869 --> 00:55:54,803
<i>Uh, est-ce qu'il, uh, um...

681
00:55:54,909 --> 00:55:57,495
<i>landing field... Calais... Oh.

682
00:55:58,493 --> 00:56:00,053
What's going...

683
00:56:03,773 --> 00:56:06,741
Oh, I say! Oh, boy!

684
00:56:36,765 --> 00:56:38,587
They're all enjoying themselves, sir.

685
00:56:38,685 --> 00:56:40,660
I should hope so.
It's costing enough.

686
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:57,532
Hey, waiter.

687
00:56:58,685 --> 00:57:00,573
Thank you.

688
00:57:04,062 --> 00:57:06,680
Mr. Newton!
Orvil!

689
00:57:06,781 --> 00:57:10,524
- Wanna drink to my health?
- What, the sea water?

690
00:57:10,621 --> 00:57:13,523
No, I mean champagne.

691
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,519
That was a very charming gesture.

692
00:57:26,045 --> 00:57:27,867
It is most strange.

693
00:57:27,965 --> 00:57:31,543
I have been to every seaside resort
all over the continent...

694
00:57:31,645 --> 00:57:33,620
but never have I seen a German dive.

695
00:57:33,725 --> 00:57:36,408
Perhaps their skulls are too thin.

696
00:57:37,885 --> 00:57:41,714
- Come, Rumpelstrosse.
We are going to dive.

697
00:57:55,101 --> 00:57:58,483
Come in, Colonel.
The water is magnificent.

698
00:58:10,845 --> 00:58:14,555
<i>- You don't like our little joke, Colonel?
- Schweinehund!

699
00:58:21,725 --> 00:58:25,041
- Uh, Newton, may I have a word with you?
- Why, sure.

700
00:58:27,805 --> 00:58:29,944
- What's on your mind?
- I think I should mention...

701
00:58:30,045 --> 00:58:34,136
that if you continue to
make advances to my fiancée,
I shall knock your block off.

702
00:58:34,237 --> 00:58:36,059
Champagne?

703
00:58:39,101 --> 00:58:42,549
Well, she's not,
uh, officially engaged to you.

704
00:58:42,653 --> 00:58:46,547
It's an understood thing
between Lord Rawnsley and myself.

705
00:58:47,901 --> 00:58:49,723
But Patricia hasn't agreed...

706
00:58:49,821 --> 00:58:53,944
and until she does,
well, I'll make all the advances I want.

707
00:58:56,221 --> 00:58:58,971
You really are being most tiresome.

708
00:59:04,797 --> 00:59:07,961
What are you doing?

709
00:59:08,061 --> 00:59:11,476
Are you two fighting over me?
Oh, good!

710
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:14,102
I say! I say!
TheJapanese chap has arrived!

711
00:59:17,309 --> 00:59:19,196
It's Yamamoto!

712
00:59:24,253 --> 00:59:26,358
You know he's flown
all the way from Japan?

713
00:59:26,461 --> 00:59:27,835
- Really?
- Yes.

714
00:59:27,933 --> 00:59:30,682
- We don't have the facts yet, sir.
- Don't argue with me.

715
00:59:30,781 --> 00:59:32,854
We must get to the landing field
and welcome him.

716
00:59:32,957 --> 00:59:34,845
Come along, everyone!

717
00:59:38,077 --> 00:59:40,084
Lieutenant Parsons, Royal Navy.

718
00:59:40,189 --> 00:59:42,012
- How do you do?
- How do you do, sir?

719
00:59:42,109 --> 00:59:45,525
- And Mr. Richard Mays,
the Coldstream Guards.
- Excuse me.

720
00:59:45,629 --> 00:59:48,531
Yamamoto, excuse me, sir.
First-a class-a flying machine.

721
00:59:48,637 --> 00:59:51,092
Thank you.

722
00:59:51,197 --> 00:59:53,172
- May I?
- Of course!

723
00:59:53,277 --> 00:59:55,100
Now that theJapanese are here...

724
00:59:55,197 --> 00:59:57,085
nobody's going to stand a chance.

725
00:59:58,301 --> 01:00:00,854
He's right.
This'll be the one to beat, governor.

726
01:00:00,957 --> 01:00:03,957
In that case, we'll have to
nobble the man and not the machine.

727
01:00:05,757 --> 01:00:09,336
Perhaps a little cascara
in his chop suey.

728
01:00:09,437 --> 01:00:11,259
Shut up.

729
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:13,332
Excuse me, sir.
May I have a word with you?

730
01:00:13,437 --> 01:00:15,260
You must've had a remarkable journey.

731
01:00:15,357 --> 01:00:18,140
Ten thousand miles, wasn't it?
Did you fly it all?

732
01:00:18,237 --> 01:00:21,620
Of course. First I came
by mule train to Yokohama...

733
01:00:21,724 --> 01:00:23,579
then by ship to Vladivostok...

734
01:00:23,677 --> 01:00:25,816
to catch the Trans-Siberian Express.

735
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:27,346
Good heavens!

736
01:00:27,453 --> 01:00:30,551
From Moscow, overland to Paris,
then to Dieppe...

737
01:00:30,653 --> 01:00:33,523
where I took the cross-channel ferry
to Folkestone.

738
01:00:33,629 --> 01:00:35,451
Quite a remarkable journey.

739
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:39,510
But at Folkestone I boarded my machine
and flew all the way here!

740
01:00:39,612 --> 01:00:42,133
Four miles!
Amazing.

741
01:00:44,829 --> 01:00:46,389
- Orvil.
- Oh, hello.

742
01:00:46,493 --> 01:00:49,591
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Well, here I am.

743
01:00:49,693 --> 01:00:51,668
- Listen, I've got an idea.
- Yeah?

744
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:54,555
While everyone's still here,
you know what we could do?

745
01:00:54,653 --> 01:00:57,435
I know what we could do
and I know what I'd like to do...

746
01:00:57,533 --> 01:00:59,355
but do you think we dare do it?

747
01:01:01,149 --> 01:01:04,465
- Motorcycles go very much
faster than motorcars.
- Mm-hmm.

748
01:01:04,572 --> 01:01:08,369
If we left now, we could be back
at Brookley before everyone else.

749
01:01:08,477 --> 01:01:11,990
- And then?
- Then...

750
01:01:12,093 --> 01:01:14,330
you could take me up
in your flying machine.

751
01:01:14,428 --> 01:01:18,552
Oh. You're really determined
to get me into trouble, now, aren't you?

752
01:01:18,653 --> 01:01:20,693
Don't you think I'm worth it?

753
01:01:22,333 --> 01:01:24,472
All right. Come on.

754
01:01:46,237 --> 01:01:48,146
<i>Bonjour, mon capitan.

755
01:01:50,109 --> 01:01:52,629
Oh. Colonel.

756
01:01:52,733 --> 01:01:54,838
<i>The name of your second, please.

757
01:01:54,941 --> 01:01:58,290
My second?
Who wishes to be my second?

758
01:01:58,397 --> 01:02:00,404
<i>Oh, Jean Pascal.

759
01:02:06,749 --> 01:02:10,491
Colonel Baron Manfred Von Holstein
demands satisfaction before the race.

760
01:02:10,589 --> 01:02:12,411
I suggest at dawn tomorrow.

761
01:02:12,509 --> 01:02:14,713
Anything you wish.

762
01:02:14,813 --> 01:02:18,129
But you are not serious?
This is 1910, you know?

763
01:02:18,237 --> 01:02:20,310
I'm aware of the date.

764
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:24,892
Tell the idiot I agree.

765
01:02:26,557 --> 01:02:28,891
He agrees.

766
01:02:28,989 --> 01:02:31,542
The choice of weapons is yours.

767
01:02:31,645 --> 01:02:35,027
Do you wish to use pistols,
sabers or rapiers?

768
01:02:43,452 --> 01:02:45,841
Balloons.

769
01:02:47,965 --> 01:02:51,707
- Balloons?
- And blunderbusses.

770
01:02:51,805 --> 01:02:54,008
You are trying to
make the fools of us again.

771
01:02:54,109 --> 01:02:57,458
On the contrary.
There is an historical precedent.

772
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,387
<i>- N'est-ce pas?
- Mm-hmm.

773
01:02:59,485 --> 01:03:02,900
A similar duel between a Frenchman
and German took place in, uh...

774
01:03:03,004 --> 01:03:05,044
- 1817.
- Is right.

775
01:03:05,149 --> 01:03:07,123
1817.

776
01:03:11,325 --> 01:03:13,212
The Frenchman won.

777
01:03:19,101 --> 01:03:22,035
In that case, I accept.

778
01:03:29,021 --> 01:03:31,476
Come along, everybody.
Let's get back to the motors.

779
01:03:31,581 --> 01:03:33,882
I expect you'll be flying back.

780
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:36,119
Come along, Richard!

781
01:03:36,221 --> 01:03:38,425
- Where's Patricia?
- I thought she was with you, sir.

782
01:03:38,524 --> 01:03:40,379
Well, of course she is...

783
01:03:42,301 --> 01:03:45,945
- What the devil is my daughter
doing in that contraption?
- Going back to Brookley, I think.

784
01:03:46,045 --> 01:03:48,118
You think she's persuaded him
to take her up?

785
01:03:48,221 --> 01:03:52,116
I absolutely forbid it. Stop him!
Stop him at once! Absolutely useless.

786
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:02,043
Faster, Richard. Faster!

787
01:04:02,141 --> 01:04:04,791
I'm doing nearly
40 miles an hour as it is, sir.

788
01:04:15,677 --> 01:04:18,065
Come down at once!
I absolutely forbid it!

789
01:04:18,173 --> 01:04:19,417
Marvelous!

790
01:04:19,517 --> 01:04:21,524
- It's fun, isn't it?
- Yes!

791
01:04:21,628 --> 01:04:23,570
Oh, look, look!
Look, there's Father.

792
01:04:25,597 --> 01:04:27,484
Let's give him a fright.

793
01:04:42,877 --> 01:04:45,560
<i>Oh, rats! I broke a wing strut.

794
01:04:45,661 --> 01:04:47,733
You take over the stick
and keep it steady, will ya?

795
01:04:47,837 --> 01:04:50,139
Oh, no. L... l... I can't.

796
01:04:50,236 --> 01:04:52,124
Okay.

797
01:04:59,261 --> 01:05:01,683
I said keep it steady!

798
01:05:11,773 --> 01:05:13,878
Orvil, help!

799
01:06:15,197 --> 01:06:17,084
Orvil!

800
01:06:18,429 --> 01:06:20,316
I can't keep it straight!

801
01:06:25,309 --> 01:06:28,342
<i>Orvil! Help me!

802
01:06:36,348 --> 01:06:38,552
I can't do it. Hurry!

803
01:07:14,653 --> 01:07:17,074
<i>- Did that girl fly the machine herself?
- Yes!

804
01:07:17,181 --> 01:07:20,312
- Are you all right, Patricia?
- Of course I'm all right.

805
01:07:20,413 --> 01:07:23,609
- How dare you take my daughter up!
- He isn't to blame!

806
01:07:23,709 --> 01:07:26,010
This race was organized
to help flying...

807
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:29,043
not for brainless boneheaded nincompoops
to give joyrides.

808
01:07:29,148 --> 01:07:30,971
I tell you, Father, it was my fault.

809
01:07:31,068 --> 01:07:33,851
It didn't occur to you, I suppose, that
if you'd crashed with a woman onboard...

810
01:07:33,948 --> 01:07:35,956
you would have put flying back 20 years.

811
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:37,882
- You might've killed her.
- Now, look...

812
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:39,802
I knew exactly what I was doing.

813
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,810
And I know what I'm doing.

814
01:07:43,132 --> 01:07:45,205
Oh, Richard!

815
01:07:45,308 --> 01:07:47,196
Patricia, come with me.

816
01:07:49,308 --> 01:07:51,447
Yes, Father.

817
01:07:51,549 --> 01:07:54,167
Niven, I'll have that machine
scratched from the race.

818
01:07:54,269 --> 01:07:57,051
<i>- Certainly, sir.
- Oh, not now, Father.
Not in front of everyone.

819
01:07:57,149 --> 01:07:59,604
- I am entirely to blame.
- I know that.

820
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,847
This is the last time
you'll go up flying...

821
01:08:01,949 --> 01:08:04,709
and this is the last time
you'll ride a motorcycle.

822
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:06,532
- Yes, Father.
- And that includes...

823
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:08,539
the one you have hidden in the garden.

824
01:08:08,646 --> 01:08:10,468
- But...
- Get into the motor!

825
01:08:10,566 --> 01:08:12,453
Oh!

826
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:25,979
She's at it again...

827
01:08:26,086 --> 01:08:27,908
Disobeying my instructions.

828
01:08:28,006 --> 01:08:30,373
I don't think so.
It's the American.

829
01:08:30,469 --> 01:08:33,339
The American? What's he doing
prowling around in my garden?

830
01:08:33,445 --> 01:08:36,064
- You suppose he has a gun?
- Why should he, sir?

831
01:08:36,166 --> 01:08:38,621
Well, the fellow's from the Wild West,
isn't he?

832
01:08:38,726 --> 01:08:41,660
- It's only a motorbicycle, sir.
- Oh.

833
01:08:41,766 --> 01:08:45,181
He's trying to get
back into the race, just as I've
been telling you for some time.

834
01:08:45,286 --> 01:08:48,068
Well, he's not going to.
He may have changed your mind.

835
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:50,370
Nothing is going to make me change mine.
Nothing!

836
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:53,318
<i>Well, go and tell him so!
Well, don't stand there!

837
01:08:53,414 --> 01:08:56,447
<i>- Anyone would think you were
frightened of the fellow!
- Yes, sir.

838
01:09:00,006 --> 01:09:03,934
I'm sorry, Newton,
but Lord Rawnsley's quite adamant.

839
01:09:04,038 --> 01:09:05,925
Not only are you out of the race...

840
01:09:06,022 --> 01:09:07,844
but he expects you to move yourself...

841
01:09:07,942 --> 01:09:09,917
and your flying machine
from Brookley as soon as possible.

842
01:09:10,022 --> 01:09:12,324
Are you sure you told him
that I had to see him?

843
01:09:12,422 --> 01:09:15,520
Look, if I don't get back in that race,
I'm gonna lose everything.

844
01:09:15,622 --> 01:09:17,761
Boy, we don't even have enough money
to get back to London...

845
01:09:17,861 --> 01:09:20,796
much less Phoenix, Arizona.

846
01:09:20,902 --> 01:09:22,724
You should have thought of that before.

847
01:09:22,822 --> 01:09:24,796
Let's face it, old chap,
he only has one daughter.

848
01:09:24,902 --> 01:09:28,066
Yes, but...
Aww, shucks!

849
01:09:30,982 --> 01:09:33,829
Well, I wanna thank you
for trying to help me.

850
01:09:33,925 --> 01:09:37,274
- What are you going to do?
- Oh, I don't know.

851
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:39,837
I guess I'll have to sell
my flying machine.

852
01:09:39,941 --> 01:09:41,764
Oh, I'm sorry.

853
01:09:41,861 --> 01:09:44,644
But at least you're in the right place
to do that.

854
01:09:44,741 --> 01:09:48,156
Well, good-bye,
and the best of luck to you.

855
01:09:48,262 --> 01:09:50,466
- You know your way out.
- Thanks for everything.

856
01:10:01,798 --> 01:10:05,376
Orvil, I'm... I'm terribly sorry.

857
01:10:05,478 --> 01:10:08,325
Oh, well.
You were worth it.

858
01:10:10,278 --> 01:10:12,579
Winning the race meant
a great deal to you...

859
01:10:12,678 --> 01:10:14,653
didn't it?

860
01:10:14,757 --> 01:10:16,896
Mm-hmm.

861
01:10:16,998 --> 01:10:19,453
If I'd have won it,
I'd have been somebody.

862
01:10:19,557 --> 01:10:22,013
I might've been able
to go up to any girl...

863
01:10:22,118 --> 01:10:25,533
even a rich
and a beautiful one...

864
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:28,507
and say to her
what I wanted to say...

865
01:10:28,614 --> 01:10:30,719
ask her what I wanted to ask.

866
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:35,361
Only it can't happen now.

867
01:10:35,462 --> 01:10:38,757
Oh, pl-please forgive me.

868
01:10:38,853 --> 01:10:40,958
I've been very, very selfish.

869
01:10:41,062 --> 01:10:43,745
I'll never forget you, Patricia.

870
01:10:48,838 --> 01:10:51,259
- Good-bye.
- Oh, no! No. Wait.

871
01:10:51,366 --> 01:10:53,700
I'm going to talk to Father.

872
01:10:53,798 --> 01:10:55,620
It won't be easy...

873
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:58,685
but I'm going to get you back
into the race.

874
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:01,245
Well, uh...

875
01:11:01,349 --> 01:11:03,389
He'll soon change his mind...

876
01:11:03,494 --> 01:11:07,389
when he hears what the American
ambassador's got to say about this.

877
01:11:07,494 --> 01:11:10,112
Well, does he know
the American ambassador?

878
01:11:10,214 --> 01:11:12,734
No.

879
01:11:12,838 --> 01:11:15,140
Neither do I.

880
01:11:16,134 --> 01:11:18,021
But Father doesn't know that.

881
01:11:28,773 --> 01:11:31,391
<i>Achtung!

882
01:11:46,438 --> 01:11:49,471
No one knows better than you gentlemen
of the international press that...

883
01:12:06,598 --> 01:12:10,373
I guess a lot of innovations have been
introduced by the various competitors.

884
01:12:10,469 --> 01:12:12,292
Oh, yes, indeed!
L... Well, uh...

885
01:12:12,389 --> 01:12:14,212
take young Parsons of the Royal Navy,
for instance...

886
01:12:14,309 --> 01:12:16,132
the fellow alighting now.

887
01:12:16,229 --> 01:12:19,677
He's got a marvelous
new naval idea for stopping
his flying machine. Look.

888
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:34,685
Uh, what's that?

889
01:12:41,158 --> 01:12:42,980
It's a flying machine, I think.

890
01:12:43,078 --> 01:12:46,012
Yes, it must be a flying machine.
It's got, um, propellers.

891
01:12:52,549 --> 01:12:56,259
- Any other questions?
- That's one out.

892
01:12:58,086 --> 01:13:00,868
You guarantee this one
will fly better than the last?

893
01:13:00,966 --> 01:13:03,421
There was nothing wrong
with my ornithopter...

894
01:13:03,525 --> 01:13:06,046
just rotten piloting, if you ask me!

895
01:13:09,285 --> 01:13:11,260
You'll like this one.

896
01:13:11,366 --> 01:13:13,886
Just start the engine,
and you're off, all right?

897
01:13:16,261 --> 01:13:18,204
Contact!

898
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:20,765
Hmm? Oh!

899
01:13:52,933 --> 01:13:55,999
Gentlemen, prepare your weapons!

900
01:14:19,653 --> 01:14:23,036
<i>Gentlemen, I count 10...

901

may foster the spirit...

934
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:10,748
<i>of peace and goodwill
amongst the aeronautists. "

935
01:23:10,849 --> 01:23:13,948
That's the idea. It won't take a minute.
If you could just turn round too, sir.

936
01:23:14,049 --> 01:23:16,504
Could we just get your photograph?
Sir, if you turn this way...

937
01:23:16,609 --> 01:23:19,544
Yes. Hand-to-hand, hands across the sea.
That's the idea.

938
01:23:19,649 --> 01:23:21,471
Now, if you could
just give us a big smile.

939
01:23:21,569 --> 01:23:23,871
That's the idea.
Now, hold it.

940
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:26,108
I always thought
that the English were noted...

941
01:23:26,209 --> 01:23:28,118
for their sense of fair play.

942
01:23:28,226 --> 01:23:30,844
<i>- Oh, we are, indeed. Yes.
- I'm ready, gentlemen.

943
01:23:30,946 --> 01:23:33,247
Well, you punched me
when I wasn't looking.

944
01:23:33,345 --> 01:23:35,800
My dear fellow, if you continue
to pursue a certain party...

945
01:23:35,906 --> 01:23:39,222
<i>I shall take the greatest pleasure
in punching you when you are looking.

946
01:23:39,330 --> 01:23:41,152
<i>Well, you're gonna
have your hands full...

947
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:43,705
because I'm gonna marry
that certain party.

948
01:23:43,809 --> 01:23:45,631
I'm afraid that's going to be
rather awkward...

949
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:47,551
because I'm going to marry her also.

950
01:23:47,649 --> 01:23:50,649
Gentlemen,
could we have a nice smile, please?

951
01:23:53,953 --> 01:23:55,840
Thank you so much.

952
01:24:01,314 --> 01:24:03,223
- Oh!
- I beg your pardon.

953
01:24:14,689 --> 01:24:17,951
Ooh! Buzz off.

954
01:24:26,722 --> 01:24:29,023
Hello!
Care for a glass of wine?

955
01:24:29,121 --> 01:24:32,536
No, thanks, old chap.
I only drink whiskey and water.

956
01:24:32,642 --> 01:24:34,464
Oh, Sir Percy. Very kind.
Is that mine?

957
01:24:34,562 --> 01:24:36,536
Thank you very much.

958
01:24:37,761 --> 01:24:40,827
- Ahhh.
- Serves him right, the greedy blighter.

959
01:24:45,665 --> 01:24:48,382
- Come, Courtney. We've got work to do.
- We can't do nothing tonight.

960
01:24:48,481 --> 01:24:50,336
There's guards all over the place.

961
01:24:50,434 --> 01:24:53,085
Besides, everybody's going to
sleep by their planes.

962
01:24:53,185 --> 01:24:55,258
Not everybody.
Yamamoto's still inside...

963
01:24:55,361 --> 01:24:59,256
and, uh, I've given the Frenchman
the address of a very lovely young lady.

964
01:24:59,361 --> 01:25:01,663
Oh-ho-ho. I'll bet she's
a bit of all right, governor.

965
01:25:01,761 --> 01:25:04,696
Well, you should know.
She's your daughter.

966
01:25:04,801 --> 01:25:07,583
But, governor,
she's an innocent young girl.

967
01:25:07,681 --> 01:25:11,030
Not is, Courtney... was.

968
01:25:12,801 --> 01:25:14,689
<i>Come on.

969
01:25:19,041 --> 01:25:21,343
Now, drop me at the American's hangar...

970
01:25:21,441 --> 01:25:24,060
then pop into Yamamoto's
and see what you can do with this.

971
01:25:25,217 --> 01:25:27,039
What are you gonna do to the Yankee?

972
01:25:27,137 --> 01:25:30,879
It's no business of yours, Courtney,
but if you really want to know...

973
01:25:30,977 --> 01:25:32,865
I'm going to arrange
that one of his wheels falls off.

974
01:25:34,113 --> 01:25:36,153
That's a bit dirty, isn't it, governor?

975
01:25:36,258 --> 01:25:38,494
If he can't land on one wheel,
he shouldn't race.

976
01:25:38,593 --> 01:25:40,415
Yeah, but he might kill himself.

977
01:25:40,513 --> 01:25:42,618
There are plenty more Americans
where he comes from.

978
01:26:46,369 --> 01:26:48,224
Now, sir, just one without your cap.

979
01:26:48,321 --> 01:26:50,143
Certainly not.
I'm a naval officer.

980
01:26:50,241 --> 01:26:52,313
Oh, well, perhaps a bit of a smile, sir?

981
01:26:52,417 --> 01:26:54,556
Oh, very well.
Just a bit of a one.

982
01:26:54,657 --> 01:26:57,919
Lieutenant Parsons, where have you been?
Everybody's been waiting for you.

983
01:26:58,017 --> 01:27:01,115
You've not got your logbook filled in
or your starter's forms or anything.

984
01:27:01,217 --> 01:27:03,770
- Meet Nelson, my passenger.
- You can't take that with you.

985
01:27:03,874 --> 01:27:06,241
- Why not?
- It'll muck up my starter's forms,
for one thing.

986
01:27:06,337 --> 01:27:08,793
And for another, no one has
yet taken an animal aloft.

987
01:27:08,897 --> 01:27:10,719
Nelson doesn't go, neither do I.

988
01:27:10,817 --> 01:27:12,956
Absolutely out of the question.

989
01:27:13,057 --> 01:27:15,959
- Go on.
- Oh, very well then.
Fill in these forms.

990
01:27:18,049 --> 01:27:22,173
Well, that's everybody... all 14 of you.

991
01:27:22,273 --> 01:27:25,055
Oh, no, it isn't.
Where are those blasted Germans?

992
01:27:25,153 --> 01:27:28,349
Over at the hangars, old man.
I don't think they know anything
about your starter's forms.

993
01:27:33,634 --> 01:27:36,830
Rumpelstrosse,
the great moment has arrived. Come.

994
01:27:36,929 --> 01:27:39,514
<i>Herr Colonel, it is no good.

995
01:27:39,617 --> 01:27:41,690
I'm a sick fellow.

996
01:27:41,793 --> 01:27:44,248
I cannot fly.

997
01:27:44,353 --> 01:27:46,655
You must fly!

998
01:27:46,753 --> 01:27:48,663
For the emperor and the fatherland!

999
01:27:48,769 --> 01:27:50,657
For the emp...

1000
01:27:50,753 --> 01:27:52,576
Excuse me.

1001
01:28:02,434 --> 01:28:05,336
It's going to be a busy day
for our lads.

1002
01:28:05,441 --> 01:28:07,863
All spectators away
from the flying machines!

1003
01:28:07,969 --> 01:28:10,391
Spectators away
from the flying machines, please!

1004
01:28:12,513 --> 01:28:14,335
- Ought to be starting them, sir.
- Nonsense.

1005
01:28:14,433 --> 01:28:16,255
I haven't wished the competitors
good luck yet.

1006
01:28:16,353 --> 01:28:18,175
What's theJapanese for "good luck"?

1007
01:28:18,273 --> 01:28:20,095
I have it here, sir.
One moment.

1008
01:28:21,249 --> 01:28:23,071
Here we are.

1009
01:28:25,089 --> 01:28:26,976
Thank you, sir.

1010
01:28:31,297 --> 01:28:32,224
Good luck.

1011
01:28:39,585 --> 01:28:41,472
Get out of it!

1012
01:28:44,289 --> 01:28:47,999
- Aren't you sitting the wrong way round?
- Of course I'm not.

1013
01:28:48,097 --> 01:28:50,269
You take me for an idiot?

1014
01:28:50,369 --> 01:28:52,409
This is my latest invention.

1015
01:28:53,666 --> 01:28:55,553
It's an idea I had in the bath...

1016
01:28:55,649 --> 01:28:58,431
when sitting with my back to the taps.

1017
01:28:58,529 --> 01:29:00,984
You see,
the wind resistance on the tail...

1018
01:29:01,089 --> 01:29:03,293
is less than it would be on the wings.

1019
01:29:03,393 --> 01:29:05,782
Heh. I shall most likely be in Paris...

1020
01:29:05,889 --> 01:29:08,791
before any of this lot
have even got to Calais.

1021
01:29:08,897 --> 01:29:10,719
It's pathetic, isn't it?

1022
01:29:10,817 --> 01:29:12,639
I don't know what he's talking about.

1023
01:29:12,737 --> 01:29:14,395
Neither does he, sir.

1024
01:29:14,497 --> 01:29:16,766
Well, let's see, now...

1025
01:29:16,865 --> 01:29:19,712
what was the French
for "give us the money"?

1026
01:29:19,809 --> 01:29:22,045
<i>Ah, bonne chance, Monsieur Dubois.

1027
01:29:22,145 --> 01:29:25,822
<i>Ah, merci, monsieur.
Mmm. Mmm.

1028
01:29:25,921 --> 01:29:28,409
Wrong frog, sir.

1029
01:29:28,513 --> 01:29:30,488
<i>Bonne chance, Monsieur Dubois.

1030
01:29:33,537 --> 01:29:35,479
<i>Ah. Bonjour, mademoiselle.

1031
01:29:41,857 --> 01:29:43,745
Really, Monsieur Dubois!

1032
01:29:45,762 --> 01:29:48,128
Uh, forgive me, mademoiselle.
I was carried away.

1033
01:29:48,225 --> 01:29:51,542
<i>The spirit of the occasión, sir.
The entente cordiale.

1034
01:29:51,649 --> 01:29:54,911
<i>If you asked me, too much entente
and far too cordiale.

1035
01:29:57,665 --> 01:30:01,014
The trouble with
these international affairs
is that they attract foreigners.

1036
01:30:03,073 --> 01:30:04,961
<i>Achtung!

1037
01:30:06,337 --> 01:30:08,192
<i>Ja!

1038
01:30:14,113 --> 01:30:17,855
<i>But I thought Captain Rumpelstrosse
was your pilot, Herr Colonel.

1039
01:30:17,953 --> 01:30:21,182
I am taking his place.
He is indisposed, sir.

1040
01:30:21,281 --> 01:30:23,289
I didn't know you could fly.

1041
01:30:23,393 --> 01:30:26,175
Oh, there's nothing
a German officer cannot do.

1042
01:30:28,321 --> 01:30:32,958
So, "Number One. Sit down." Ah, so...

1043
01:30:37,505 --> 01:30:40,352
Surely, you're not taking your family
with you, are you?

1044
01:30:40,449 --> 01:30:42,271
You always make-a the joke.

1045
01:30:42,369 --> 01:30:45,151
They come to wish their papa good-bye.

1046
01:30:45,249 --> 01:30:49,177
No, no. Sophia, no.
No, no, no, no, no. Sophia.

1047
01:30:49,281 --> 01:30:51,648
I see you have
another new flying machine.

1048
01:30:51,745 --> 01:30:53,818
Presented to me personally...

1049
01:30:53,921 --> 01:30:56,191
by his majesty the King of Italy.

1050
01:30:56,289 --> 01:31:00,381
<i>- Generale Parlonni.
- Fsst. Fsst.

1051
01:31:00,481 --> 01:31:02,903
Well, good luck to you
and the King of Italy.

1052
01:31:03,009 --> 01:31:05,213
Thank you, milord.
Thank you, milord.

1053
01:31:05,313 --> 01:31:07,866
No, no, Sophia.
Sophia, no, no, no.

1054
01:31:07,969 --> 01:31:11,351
- Excuse me, can you tell me
where you come from?
- Phoenix, Arizona.

1055
01:31:11,457 --> 01:31:12,798
Good luck.

1056
01:31:12,897 --> 01:31:14,872
If it wasn't for
my daughter's persuasiveness...

1057
01:31:14,977 --> 01:31:18,555
and my native sporting instinct,
you'd be out of this race.

1058
01:31:18,657 --> 01:31:21,112
Fortunately,
I am a very reasonable man.

1059
01:31:21,217 --> 01:31:23,355
Good luck to you.

1060
01:31:23,457 --> 01:31:25,759
At least if he breaks his neck,
my daughter won't be with him.

1061
01:31:25,857 --> 01:31:28,312
- Good luck, Orvil.
- Oh, thank you, Patricia.

1062
01:31:28,417 --> 01:31:30,556
Say, will I get to see you in Paris?

1063
01:31:30,657 --> 01:31:34,551
There's something
I want to talk to you about...
something very important.

1064
01:31:34,657 --> 01:31:37,024
Oh, yes, I'll be there.

1065
01:31:38,497 --> 01:31:41,813
Mm. We're going over
on Father's private yacht.

1066
01:31:41,921 --> 01:31:43,776
Richard.

1067
01:31:43,873 --> 01:31:46,720
- Oh. Well...
- Oh.

1068
01:31:46,817 --> 01:31:48,792
I'm not going to wish you luck, my boy.

1069
01:31:48,897 --> 01:31:51,744
- I expect you to win without it.
- Well, I'll do my best, sir.

1070
01:31:51,841 --> 01:31:53,663
Thank you.

1071
01:31:53,761 --> 01:31:56,379
- Well, good luck, me dear fellow.
- Thank you, sir.

1072
01:31:58,657 --> 01:32:00,544
Good luck, Richard.

1073
01:32:00,641 --> 01:32:04,023
Uh, well, thanks.
And thanks for all your help too.

1074
01:32:04,129 --> 01:32:06,976
Listen, Patricia,
as soon as I get to Paris,
I've got to talk to you.

1075
01:32:07,073 --> 01:32:09,375
It's very important.
You'll be there, won't you?

1076
01:32:09,473 --> 01:32:11,545
- Yes, I'll be there.
- Bye.

1077
01:32:11,649 --> 01:32:13,787
Bye-bye.

1078
01:32:13,889 --> 01:32:17,369
There they are, Courtney.

1079
01:32:17,473 --> 01:32:19,677
- I've done everything you said, sir.
- Good.

1080
01:32:19,777 --> 01:32:22,810
Right, now get down to Dover
and carry out the rest of
your master's instructions.

1081
01:32:22,913 --> 01:32:25,847
Oh, can't I wait
and see the nip take off?

1082
01:32:25,953 --> 01:32:27,447
All right.

1083
01:32:27,553 --> 01:32:30,236
Don't think you're gonna get treats
like this all the time, Courtney.

1084
01:32:36,257 --> 01:32:38,591
I say, the wind's getting up a bit, sir.

1085
01:32:38,689 --> 01:32:41,274
- We're 20 minutes late as it is.
- We've just got to start.

1086
01:32:49,633 --> 01:32:51,455
I can't start without Lord Rawnsley.

1087
01:32:51,553 --> 01:32:53,691
Well, can you start it quickly
when he does arrive?

1088
01:32:53,793 --> 01:32:56,214
Of course.
I've only got to do this to start it.

1089
01:33:03,072 --> 01:33:04,895
Look, they're off!

1090
01:33:04,992 --> 01:33:06,815
I didn't tell them they could start.

1091
01:33:39,521 --> 01:33:41,408
A knife!

1092
01:33:42,689 --> 01:33:44,631
Get me a knife.

1093
01:33:44,737 --> 01:33:46,559
You ain't going to commit hari-kari?

1094
01:33:46,657 --> 01:33:48,664
Of course not, you bloody fool.

1095
01:33:48,769 --> 01:33:51,486
I've got to cut my way out, haven't I?

1096
01:33:54,849 --> 01:33:57,697
All right, Courtney, shoot off.
You've had your treat.

1097
01:33:57,792 --> 01:33:59,615
- Yeah...
- Well, go on!

1098
01:34:09,601 --> 01:34:11,674
Away you go!

1099
01:34:42,048 --> 01:34:45,594
- Mama! Mama, he's up!
- Yes, but he's got to get down again,
you know?

Oh, mamma mia.

into our privacy.

Be good enough to remove yourself
and your machine immediately.

so I can take off. Fsst!

Yes, governor,
if you give them 10 guineas each.

1180

Ten guineas? I can get a chambermaid
for a year for that.

Do they guarantee

Yes, governor.

Uh, a hundred and ten.

- What railway lines?
- I never thought he had the courage.

01:56:26,335 --> 01:56:29,237
He's so far in the lead,
nothing can stop him.
Nothing at all. Ha!

1234
01:56:29,344 --> 01:56:31,253
<i>Vive Sir Percy!

1235
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:33,531
What am I saying?
He's a most ghastly person.

1236
01:56:43,552 --> 01:56:45,112
Buzz off!

1237
01:56:46,815 --> 01:56:49,336
<i>Go on! Bug off!

1238
01:59:21,311 --> 01:59:23,929
Blast it!

1239
01:59:26,783 --> 01:59:28,671
Driver!

1240
01:59:42,239 --> 01:59:44,890
Driver!
Stop the train!

1241
01:59:48,863 --> 01:59:51,962
<i>Arretez le train!

1242
02:00:30,335 --> 02:00:32,091
Blast!

1243
02:01:13,855 --> 02:01:15,797
Look! Go!

1244
02:01:18,976 --> 02:01:22,838
Hey, you!
Where can I get some...

1245
02:01:22,943 --> 02:01:25,813
<i>Françoise, what are you doing here?

1246
02:01:25,919 --> 02:01:27,741
Pardon, monsieur?

1247
02:01:27,839 --> 02:01:31,352
- Uh, you are not Françoise?
- No, Yvette. Why?

1248
02:01:31,456 --> 02:01:33,278
Hey.

1249
02:01:34,944 --> 02:01:37,180
Um, where can I get some gasoline?

1250
02:01:37,279 --> 02:01:40,628
At Amiens.
It is five kilometers from here.

1251
02:01:40,735 --> 02:01:42,710
Uh-huh.

1252
02:01:42,815 --> 02:01:46,612
Be a good fellow
and bring me as much as possible.

1253
02:01:46,720 --> 02:01:51,226
The honor of France is at stake.

1254
02:01:51,327 --> 02:01:54,327
- But, Yvette!
- You must go. Go, go, go!

1255
02:01:54,431 --> 02:01:59,865
All right! All right,
but I will be a good 30 minutes.

1256
02:02:04,895 --> 02:02:08,278
We have 30 minutes.

1257
02:02:52,447 --> 02:02:55,611
Excuse me.
Can you see anyone yet?

1258
02:02:55,711 --> 02:03:00,446
Yes! Ponticelli is first
round the Eiffel Tower.

1259
02:03:00,543 --> 02:03:02,397
There are two more on his tail!

1260
02:03:21,215 --> 02:03:24,564
<i>This is going to be a close finish,
very close indeed.

1261
02:03:24,671 --> 02:03:27,737
<i>Count Ponticelli's still ahead,
followed by...

1262
02:03:27,839 --> 02:03:30,522
<i>Orvil Newton, Richard Mays.

1263
02:04:29,983 --> 02:04:32,023
Jump!

1264
02:04:54,495 --> 02:04:57,811
<i>And here they come now!
Here's the winner!

1265
02:05:00,191 --> 02:05:03,769
<i>It's Richard Mays!
Richard Mays of England!

1266
02:05:18,335 --> 02:05:20,091
You get ready to jump now!

1267
02:05:43,519 --> 02:05:46,585
- Ponticelli. Ah, Ponticelli!
You all right?
- Eh?

1268
02:05:46,687 --> 02:05:49,338
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

1269
02:05:49,439 --> 02:05:51,544
<i>Emilio! Emilio!

1270
02:05:51,647 --> 02:05:57,179
Emilio! Ohh!

1271
02:06:03,711 --> 02:06:06,012
Patricia?

1272
02:06:06,111 --> 02:06:09,973
Oh, Richard! Oh, Richard!
You won!

1273
02:06:10,079 --> 02:06:15,032
<i>Oh, Richard! You won! You won!
You won! I'm so pleased.

1274
02:06:15,135 --> 02:06:18,004
- What happened to Ponticelli?
- Well, his machine caught fire.

1275
02:06:18,111 --> 02:06:21,788
Orvil was marvelous!
He had to stop to pick him up.

1276
02:06:21,886 --> 02:06:24,308
He could have won though.

1277
02:06:25,630 --> 02:06:27,867
Hey, Richard! Richard.

1278
02:06:27,967 --> 02:06:29,974
Richard, congratulations.

1279
02:06:31,263 --> 02:06:33,849
Well done, Richard!
Congratulations!

1280
02:06:33,951 --> 02:06:37,595
Well, you deserve it more than I do.
It was a wonderful thing you did.

1281
02:06:37,695 --> 02:06:39,932
You'd have done the same thing
if you'd have seen him.

1282
02:06:40,030 --> 02:06:42,397
Well, you did it.

1283
02:06:42,495 --> 02:06:44,600
Let's call it a tie.
We'll share the prize.

1284
02:06:49,215 --> 02:06:52,892
The city of Paris
salutes the gallant victor!

1285
02:06:57,215 --> 02:06:59,964
Pierre Dubois is coming!

1286
02:07:30,783 --> 02:07:32,605
Pierre!

1287
02:07:36,318 --> 02:07:38,707
You remember me, don't you?

1288
02:07:38,815 --> 02:07:43,005
<i>- Yes, of course. You-You are... You are...
- Betty.

1289
02:07:43,103 --> 02:07:46,299
Betty! Of course. Oh.
How could I ever forget?

1290
02:07:46,399 --> 02:07:48,733
Every time I look at you,
my heart sings.

1291
02:07:48,831 --> 02:07:50,936
Oh!

1292
02:07:52,734 --> 02:07:54,807
Will you pardon me?

1293
02:07:54,910 --> 02:07:58,969
I better have a look at my undercarriage.
It's been taking an awful beating.

1294
02:08:01,567 --> 02:08:03,389
I think we ought to go
and find somewhere to put...

1295
02:08:03,487 --> 02:08:06,357
We must have your photograph
by your machine, monsieur.

1296
02:08:06,463 --> 02:08:10,009
Over here. This way.

1297
02:08:10,111 --> 02:08:12,151
And now you stop flying, huh?

1298
02:08:12,255 --> 02:08:14,164
- Do I have to?
- You have to.

1299
02:08:14,271 --> 02:08:16,158
Not for me, but for bambinos.

1300
02:08:16,255 --> 02:08:19,833
By now they're used to it.

1301
02:08:19,935 --> 02:08:23,644
- Another one?
- Uh-huh.

1302
02:08:23,743 --> 02:08:26,394
In that case, I give up.

1303
02:08:26,494 --> 02:08:29,494
- Emilio.
- Sophia.

1304
02:08:29,599 --> 02:08:32,948
Turn around.

1305
02:08:52,799 --> 02:08:56,094
- Whoops!
- Oh!

1306
02:08:58,143 --> 02:09:01,274
<i>So ended the 1910 air race.

1307
02:09:01,375 --> 02:09:05,499
<i>- The winner's time:
25 hours, 11 minutes.

<i>Today the same distance can be covered
by supersonic jets in seven minutes...

1309
02:09:18,815 --> 02:09:22,263

02:09:25,854 --> 02:09:27,764
May I have your attention, please?

1311
02:09:27,871 --> 02:09:31,668
We regret to announce that the departure
of all planes from London to Paris...

1312
02:09:31,774 --> 02:09:34,043
- have been delayed again,
owing to bad weather.

1313
