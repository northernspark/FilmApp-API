2
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,900
Whoa! Whoa!

3
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,000
Whoa!

4
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,200
Whoa.

5
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,100
- Easy.
- Mornin'.

6
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,700
Mornin'. Y'all mind
steppin' aside?

7
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,400
- You know what l think?
- No, sir, l don't.

8
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,500
l think you got yourselves
a shipment of gold in that wagon...

9
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,200
that you're bringin'
to General Lee.

10
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,000
- Just who might you be?
- A friend of the Confederacy.

11
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,900
Why don't y'all show us what a
good friend you are by steppin' aside?

12
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
l'd be most happy to,
'cept first...

13
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,800
l'd be much obliged
if you'd give me that gold.

14
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,100
l don't think l heard you correct.

15
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,300
l think you did.
l'd like that gold now.

16
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,000
Listen, mister, it ain't
very nice out here, as you can see.

17
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,400
There are five of us.

18
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,000
lf you don't step aside now,
l'd just as soon kill you as not.

19
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,300
You wanna die out here in this
miserable weather, that's your choice.

20
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,900
l'm gonna ask you
one more time.

21
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,900
Would you please
give me the gold?

22
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,100
Good afternoon, senators.

23
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,100
The president is very
grateful for your time here.

24
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,200
Believe me, this is a matter
of the utmost importance.

25
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,200
l cannot stress too much
the utmost secrecy.

26
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,800
Why don't you just
cut out the shit, George?

27
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,700
You're here to ask the committee
for money, so come out and ask for it.

28
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,500
Thanks for the advice.
l am gonna ask you for money.

29
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Guess what else?
You're gonna give it to me.

30
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,600
You all remember
Dr. Hans Kleindast...

31
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,800
the Nobel Laureate who helped us
during the space program?

32
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,400
For 20 years...

33
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,600
he's been keeping his face
off of Time magazine doing research.

34
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,100
His field of research
has been time travel.

35
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,300
- Time travel.
- Time travel.

36
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,700
- Well, beam me up, Scotty.
- That's very funny, Senator.

37
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,900
- Wanna know what's funnier than that?
- He's gonna tell us.

38
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,900
The funny thing is...
the good doctor actually did it.

39
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,900
l thought that'd
get your attention.

40
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,700
He did it. The technology is
in the folders in front of you.

41
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,600
You won't understand it
any better than l can.

42
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,000
Now, you can't go forward,
because the future hasn't happened yet.

43
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,800
However, you can go back,
and that's where things get tricky.

44
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,300
lf you go back and change something,
it's serious. lt could be catastrophic.

45
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,600
lt's like throwing
a stone in a lake...

46
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,900
only now there
are ripples in time.

47
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,300
So you can't go back and kill Hitler,
much as we'd like to...

48
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,300
because it could cause
a chain reaction of events...

49
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,900
that could alter
or even destroy mankind.

50
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,300
And that, my good senators,
is where you come in.

51
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,900
We have to form a new agency to police
this technology and protect time.

52
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,300
lt will be called the Time Enforcement
Commission or the T.E.C.

53
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,400
Eugene Matuzak of the Washington P.D.
is our choice to run the commission.

54
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,100
- How much is this gonna cost?
- A lot.

55
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,300
- How much is a lot?
- More than a little
and less than too much.

56
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,700
This is not a good time
to ask for money. The economy--

57
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,700
Suppose one of our competitors goes
back in time and invents the computer?

58
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,700
Or the airplane or the automobile?

59
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,800
You wanna talk about
the American economy, Senator?

60
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,100
How about this one?
Saddam Hussein finances a trip to 1944.

61
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,700
He gets our technology...

62
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,500
and lraq becomes the first country
to have the atomic bomb.

63
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,500
- Oh, you like that one.
- Not bad.

64
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,300
Try this one.
We think there's already been a ripple.

65
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,100
Ten days ago, the C.l.A. broke up
an arms sale to terrorists...

66
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,000
in Hamburg, Germany.

67
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,700
Ordinarily, that sort of news
doesn't cross the president's desk.

68
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,300
What made this different...

69
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
was that the purchase
was made with gold bullion...

70
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,000
and the bullion
was dated 1863...

71
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,900
and stamped
''Confederate States of America.''

72
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,700
We had it carbon-tested
and authenticated. lt's real.

73
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,100
Now, just think
about what l'm saying.

74
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,400
Going back in time
is a pretty easy way to make money.

75
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Our committee would have exclusive
jurisdiction over this program?

76
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,600
Yours and yours alone. No one can know
about this. lt's too dangerous.

77
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,100
That's very good, George.

78
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,400
Personally...

79
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,100
l think this sounds like that
bullshit Star Wars program.

80
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,000
You'll get your money. Anyone here want
to chair the oversight on this program?

81
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,800
Yeah, l'll do it.

82
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,900
Ah, young Senator McComb.

83
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,800
Why not?
Oh, you'll like him, George.

84
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,200
Very much like you,
except his dorsal fin's a bit bigger.

85
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,900
There's never enough time.

86
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,400
Never enough for what?

87
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,100
To satisfy a woman.

88
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,400
Then you never want
to miss an opportunity.

89
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,300
Are you busy?

90
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,300
l'm meeting my husband.

91
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,500
lf l were him,
l would not keep you waiting.

92
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,300
lf he's not here when l turn around,
l'll go home with you.

93
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,900
You'll do.

94
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,700
Mmm.

95
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,700
l didn't hear you
leave this morning.

96
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,500
lt was early.
l was meeting with Matuzak.

97
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,000
Are you gonna
take that job?

98
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
- What?
- Be right back.

99
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,500
Read it.

100
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,700
- ''Wolverine''?
- Between the lines.

101
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,600
l should get
the fuck outta here.

102
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,500
Good.

103
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,700
You know that purse?
Doesn't look good on you.

104
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,400
Thank you.

105
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,800
- Glad you're not hurt.
- Thank you.

106
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,900
Smart kid.
He read my mind.

107
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,800
With your English,
he doesn't have much choice.

108
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,900
Hey, l know all the good words.

109
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,600
You didn't answer my question.

110
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,400
- Are you gonna take this job?
- l think so.

111
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,800
ls this T.E.C. thing dangerous?

112
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,000
l don't bake cookies for a living.

113
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,700
Will you have to travel?

114
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,600
Not the way you think.

115
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,700
Pictures bring back your memories.

116
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,000
Aw, you're gonna
be very happy you have this.

117
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
Why?

118
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,400
l can see into the future.

119
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,300
- You can see the future, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

120
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,100
- What do you see?
- l see it's gonna rain.

121
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,800
We both have
the afternoon off.

122
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:48,200
Why don't we go and practice some of
those words you seem to like so much?

123
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Max?

124
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,900
Hmm? What?

125
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,900
l have something l want to tell you.

126
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,800
Shit. l'm sorry.

127
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,400
Don't answer it.
Just this once, don't answer it.

128
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,000
l have to.

129
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,400
Walker.

130
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,400
Now?

131
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,200
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Can you find somebody else?

132
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,100
Look, uh, somebody
called in sick and--

133
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,100
And there's nobody
but Max Walker...

134
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,400
- to keep the streets safe.
- l said l was sorry.

135
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,700
- lt's not like l have a choice.
- Of course you have a choice.

136
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,700
- This is what l do.
- l know that's what you do.

137
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,600
lt's just that things
are different now.

138
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,900
What are you
talking about?

139
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,300
This isn't the way
l wanted to do this.

140
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,300
l have to go.

141
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,500
There's something
you need to tell me?

142
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,000
Yes.

143
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,400
Can you wait
until l get back?

144
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,300
Sure.

145
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,900
Surprise.

146
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,000
Max!

147
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,500
Melissa!

148
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,700
Max!

149
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,300
- Finish him.
- Who are you?

150
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,900
You're a smart boy.
Why don't you sleep on it a while?

151
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,100
Nothing to see over there.
lt's just another jumper.

152
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,000
Hang on, there, buddy!

153
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,500
All right, close enough! That's it!

154
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,900
Thank you!
Stand back, folks!

155
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,800
Come on! Break it up!
There's nothin' to see!

156
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,300
Go back to work. Come on!
Come on, now! Come on, now.

157
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Break it up.
Go back to work.

158
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,000
Come on. Come on,
get out of here.

159
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,500
- Good morning, Mr. Atwood.
- Good morning, Charlie.

160
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,200
- lt's a terrible day, sir.
- Beat it.

161
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,500
- What's goin' on?
- Mr. Floatbauer.

162
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,700
He went off the roof.

163
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,200
Ah, yeah.

164
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,500
Well, shit happens.
Excuse me.

165
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh, that poor man!

166
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,900
Good morning, Pete.

167
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,800
Good morning, Mr. Atwood.

168
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,900
Third jumper this week. They keep
this up, you're gonna be out of a job.

169
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,900
Only going down, sir.

170
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,300
There he is!

171
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,500
- Mr. Atwood, isn't it terrible?
- Tragic.

172
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,400
...little lovebirds

173
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,400
We're not above birds

174
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,600
Let's misbehave

175
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,200
Slip and slide

176
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,800
Slip inside

177
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,200
Slip and slide

178
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,100
l learn to love
l learn to live

179
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Get me Ross.

180
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,300
Ross! Hi!
Yeah, listen.

181
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,800
l want another 100,000 shares
of Middle States Oil.

182
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,900
No, no. Just buy it.
lt's an act of faith.

183
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,700
l really think things
are gonna turn around.

184
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,100
l got a feeling
about the future.

185
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,500
Look, l gotta go.
l'm-- l'm very busy.

186
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,100
- Walker.
- How've you been, Lyle?

187
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,700
How ya doin', partner?

188
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,700
- Ex-partner.
- Max.

189
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,400
l'm not gonna change a thing. The only
ripples'll be in my swimming pool.

190
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,500
lt's a nice place.
You couldn't do this by yourself.

191
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,500
- Who are you working for?
- l'm not hurtin' anybody.

192
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,100
lt's America, man! l'm just
takin' an opportunity, that's all.

193
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,000
l've got to take you back.

194
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,800
l went ten rounds with
John L. Sullivan himself.

195
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,800
Oh.

196
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,500
l saw Tyson beat Spinks on TV.

197
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,200
- Mr. Atwood-- Oh, my god!
- Get down.

198
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,000
Doesn't look too good, Lyle.

199
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,900
Let me go, Max.

200
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
l'll stay here.
l won't go back.

201
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,200
Who sent you?
l want the name.

202
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,100
Like it'll make any difference.

203
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,000
ln a few weeks,
this guy's gonna run the whole country.

204
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,100
lf he doesn't get the money here,
he's gonna get it somewhere else.

205
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,900
l can't tell you. He'll send somebody
back to wipe out my grandparents.

206
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,300
lt'll be like l never existed:

207
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,200
my mother, my father, my wife,
my kids, my fuckin' cat!

208
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,300
You ever hear of the name Aaron McComb?
Senator McComb?

209
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Bullshit.

210
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,300
You don't understand.
He's gonna be president.

211
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,200
He's doin' this to get
money for his campaign.

212
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,000
Shit, Max, he already
owns most of the guys we work with!

213
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,000
When we get back,
you'll point them out.

214
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,000
You're out of your mind.
This guy's gonna roll right over you.

215
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,400
- We'll see. Let's go.
- Listen to me!

216
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,100
lf l go back and talk,
my family is dead.

217
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,300
l'm talkin' about my f--
my family!

218
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
lf l die here, it's only me.
l can't go back!

219
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,700
l have to bring you back.
l have no choice.

220
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,000
Neither do l.

221
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,600
Holy Mother of Mary!

222
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,400
Lieutenant Clapton, 0316.

223
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,400
Lieutenant Clapton.

224
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
Testify and l'll do what l can.

225
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,800
Communication relays
rerouted to Alpha 02.

226
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,900
Captain Lyle Atwood,
you are charged with violations...

227
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,400
of T.E.C. code 40.8,
subsection nine...

228
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,000
time travel with intent
to alter the future.

229
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,800
Charges are compounded by your current
status as a time enforcement officer.

230
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,000
Does the defendant
have any statement?

231
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,600
- Tell her.
- Something to say on your own behalf?

232
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,200
- Yes.
- No.

233
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,000
Then l will pass sentence
as mandated by our charter.

234
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,000
Say something.
Come on. Say something!

235
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,400
The defendant has been
found guilty...

236
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,800
Take care of yourself, Max.

237
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,200
and is sentenced to death,
immediately.

238
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,800
Poor bastard.

239
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,700
Tomorrow might've been
a brighter day.

240
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
We're pickin' up
some noise outside Camp David, '79.

241
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,900
lntelligence thinks
it's a kill team out of lran.

242
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,800
lt's their third
try this year.

243
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,700
C.l.A.'s trying to locate
their launch facility.

244
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,600
l want two teams on this date.
Let's smoke these guys.

245
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,300
- Right.
- Number two: Los Angeles, 1902.

246
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,000
Somebody's trying to get a jump on
real-estate, buying up Beverly Hills.

247
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,000
- Burr and Swain got the deal.
- Yes, sir.

248
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,800
You look like shit.

249
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,700
- We have to talk.
- ln a minute.

250
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,000
- Now.
- l said in a minute.

251
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,400
Temporary wave guide
shutdown in three minutes.

252
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,800
Shit. Go over your dispatch notes
and check with me before you launch.

253
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,000
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- George. Welcome.

254
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,100
Gene. Senator Nelson, this is
T.E.C. Director Matuzak.

255
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Senator Nelson is the newest member
of the oversight committee.

256
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,300
Since he's gonna be voting
on your budget...

257
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,000
he'd like to see how it's spent.

258
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,500
Senator McComb,
our long-standing committee chairman...

259
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,400
agreed to take time out from his
presidential campaign to accompany us.

260
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,400
Senator.

261
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,800
Well. Be a pleasure
to show you around.

262
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,200
Are these all of your agents?

263
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Most of 'em. Agent Monroe.
Agent Anderson.

264
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,800
Agents Burr, Bartolo and Shepherd.

265
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,800
- Agent Walker.
- Agent Walker.

266
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,100
l've heard a great deal about you.

267
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,100
- And l've heard a lot about you.
- Not all of it bad, l hope.

268
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,700
Agent Walker just returned
from a successful mission.

269
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,300
Well, congratulations,
Agent Walker.

270
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,200
Senator, now Director Matuzak
will show you the launch room.

271
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,600
Follow me.
l'll show you where we kick off.

272
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,100
You wouldn't mind
if Agent Walker accompanied us?

273
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,300
l'd love to hear about
his most recent mission.

274
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,800
- l have a report to file.
- Agent Walker would be delighted.

275
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,800
All units switch to TEC channel three.

276
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,900
All units switch
to TEC channel three.

277
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,100
As you can see,
we've spared every expense.

278
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,000
No comfort, no convenience,
no necessities. Watch your head.

279
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,200
So, Agent Walker,
who were you after?

280
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,900
A man named Atwood.
Ring a bell?

281
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,500
Atwood. No.
Should that name be familiar to me?

282
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,600
-Unfortunately, Atwood was a TEC agent.
-Really?

283
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,500
See, George, l don't
want to sound like a broken record...

284
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,400
but that's one of the dangers
of having an agency like this.

285
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,500
- lmagine the dangers of not having it.
- Did you know this Atwood?

286
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,400
He was my partner.

287
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,200
Oh, l'm sorry.
Nothing worse than a rogue cop.

288
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,700
- Except the guy who paid him.
- lf there is such a guy.

289
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,600
- There always is.
- Do you know who the man is?

290
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,800
- Oh, yeah.
- Why don't you arrest him?

291
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,700
- l lost my witness.
- Oh.

292
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,600
Well, l trust you'll
keep working on it.

293
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,300
You can bet on it.

294
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,900
Hydrogen specialists,
prepare for inspection.

295
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,500
We've updated our entire operation
to Parker Datalink Systems...

296
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
utilizing their
superconducting chip.

297
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,900
Senator McComb
was Jack Parker's partner...

298
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,700
and sold out before the company
got the patent on that chip.

299
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,400
- Bet that cost you a few billion.
- Whoa, bad luck.

300
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,000
My deal with Jack Parker
is not important, Mr. Spota.

301
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,100
What is important is talking about
the dangers of this program.

302
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,500
- You got my vote.
- Excuse me. What dangers?

303
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,000
Well, dishonest agents
like this, uh, Atwood.

304
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,400
Every time an agent goes back,
he risks making contact with
the past version of himself.

305
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,200
- That could be a disaster.
- And why is that?

306
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,900
The same matter can't occupy
the same space at the same time.

307
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,200
lt's never happened.

308
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,100
Not yet, but what l propose...

309
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
is far less costly
yet accomplishes the same thing.

310
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,200
Why don't we just
prevent time travel...

311
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,200
rather than spend money
trying to police it?

312
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,200
l have to get back
to the Hill.

313
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:13,000
Malcolm, this is a project
that we could do without.

314
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,200
l hope you vote against
continued appropriations.

315
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,000
l admire your dedication,
Agent Walker.

316
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,400
l hope you keep trying
to get your man.

317
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,100
l never quit.

318
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,000
We've done a breakdown
of the latest poll results.

319
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,800
While the trends
are not what we want...

320
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,000
there are some good things
we can utilize.

321
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,400
The numbers in the suburbs
are encouraging...

322
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,600
but they are killing you
in the urban centers.

323
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,700
But you're gaining with the pro-life,
pro-death-penalty coalition...

324
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,900
and with the close-our-border,
anti-immigration faction.

325
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,500
The bad news is the campaign chairman
put together a projected budget...

326
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,700
from now to Election Day,
and it's a big number.

327
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,400
Even going back again, l don't see how
you could get it all in time.

328
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Lawrence, l love you.
l really do.

329
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,100
But don't tell me
what l can't do.

330
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,800
Elections are won with television.

331
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,000
You don't need the press, endorsements.
You don't even need the truth.

332
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,800
You need money.

333
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,100
So... tell me.

334
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,500
How much is it gonna cost
to buy the network time l need?

335
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,900
- $50 million.
- $50 million.

336
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Agent Walker has already
cost me that much.

337
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,100
We're gonna chat with him, the kind
of chat a man remembers for a lifetime.

338
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,200
Sure is a handsome devil, isn't he?

339
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,700
- He's not my type.
- What did you want to talk about?

340
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,000
What do you know
about him?

341
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,400
Capable of eating
his young.

342
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,900
He sure seemed interested
in you this afternoon.

343
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,900
He interests me.

344
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,800
Atwood named him.

345
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,800
- You're shittin' me.
- He's the one who sent him back.

346
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,300
- Why didn't he testify?
- McComb would go after his family.

347
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,900
He also said McComb
has half of the agency. l believe him.

348
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,800
He doesn't have me.

349
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,700
l said, he doesn't have me.

350
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,600
- Well, fuck you too.
- He's gonna close the agency.

351
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,000
Then no one can stop him
from going back.

352
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,700
- This one is mine.
- Not unless l say it is.

353
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,400
The son of a bitch
is a presidential candidate.

354
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,500
lf you haul him in, you better have
enough evidence to plug up the Potomac.

355
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,400
- You believe me.
- l always believe you...

356
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,100
but you're not always right.

357
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,300
Yeah.

358
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,300
Come over to the house for dinner.

359
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,400
Carol would love to see you.

360
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,800
Thanks. Some other time.

361
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,200
You're allowed to have a life.
l read it in a manual.

362
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,600
l'll tell you this:
lf l cannot go back to save her...

363
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,900
this scumbag is not
going back to steal money.

364
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,900
Go home, Max.

365
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,100
lf you won't come to mine,
go to yours.

366
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,600
By the way, when l said
McComb hasn't bought me...

367
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,800
you were supposed to say,
''l know that.''

368
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,800
l know that.

369
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,600
System initialized.

370
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,000
Destination, please.

371
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,300
Home.

372
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,700
There are no new messages.

373
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,300
Television.

374
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,700
Play tape.

375
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,000
lt's going to look like
this when l'm finished.

376
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,400
See? Very nice.

377
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,100
''Victorian Villa Deluxe Birdhouse.''

378
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:10,600
This thing is gonna be bigger
than our house by the time l'm done.

379
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,600
Okay. Uh-huh.

380
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,400
- Want some help?
-Want some help?

381
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,300
Yeah. You can buy the birdseed.

382
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,200
Okay. Divide all these parts...

383
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,600
into groups to determine
their structural function.

384
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,000
- l should buy more videotapes.
- l should buy more videotapes.

385
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,900
Gotta be in the mood to do this.

386
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,100
- You were a second ago.
- You were a second ago.

387
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,100
l think that l should...

388
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,200
start with something
easier to put together.

389
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,500
Huh? Honey?

390
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,400
Maybe you should lay out
all the parts first, then...

391
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,600
- You know--
- l think l wanna try from memory.

392
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,400
Just find part ''A''
and work from there.

393
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,400
The controversy...

394
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,200
over government-provided campaign funds
is in the news again.

395
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,600
The White Supremacist Party has
qualified for matching funds...

396
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,500
sparking many groups to petition
for the abolition of the practice.

397
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,400
Meanwhile, Senator McComb's
fading presidential bid...

398
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,900
received another blow...

399
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,800
when today it was denied
federal campaign matching funds.

400
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Sources indicate
the senator is out of money...

401
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,900
and may be forced
to withdraw from the race.

402
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,300
Though no official
statement has been made...

403
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,100
independent party leaders claim that
the denial will bolster their play...

404
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,000
for the upcoming
presidential election.

405
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,200
With the polls showing
independent candidate Elgin Michaels...

406
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,100
trailing the incumbent
by only six points--

407
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,400
There are no new messages.

408
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,200
Who are you?
Who sent you?

409
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,600
Who sent you?

410
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,600
Fifty thousand volts, motherfucker.

411
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,600
Have a nice day.

412
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,700
Walker?

413
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,200
Walker!

414
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,600
My name's Fielding.
l'm with lnternal Affairs.

415
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,400
He messed up my apartment.
You can kill him.

416
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
You've got some more inside.

417
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,700
- Everybody freeze!
- l'm a cop! l'm a cop!

418
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
l.D.
l.D.

419
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,700
Get in there.

420
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
You, he's under arrest.

421
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,800
They're all under arrest.

422
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,400
Assault, attempted murder,
makin' a mess.

423
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,600
Sector 17, Sector 19.

424
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,800
Report for duty
in five minutes.

425
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,600
lf you'd like,
l'll have the door removed.

426
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,500
l had company
this morning.

427
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,100
- You look like they stayed awhile.
- McComb sent them.

428
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,500
- Did they say that?
- l said that.

429
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,200
- And what does l.A. want?
- Atwood was your partner.

430
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,800
lnternal Affairs isn't convinced
you can be trusted anymore.

431
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,900
- She's not going to follow me.
- We've got a phase four. You take it.

432
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,400
Send somebody else.
l want to be where McComb is.

433
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,800
A little refresher course in Agency
etiquette: l'm the director, l direct.

434
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,900
l authorize the missions. l make
the assignments. This one's yours.

435
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,200
This agency isn't dead yet, but if l
can't keep you from McComb, it will be!

436
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,200
- Fielding, get in here!
- She'll get in my way.

437
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,200
Ask her to stay behind you.
You've got an hour until launch.

438
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,100
-You're not funny.
- l'm never funny.

439
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
Yeah?

440
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,800
Disturbance has jumped
from four to six, sir.

441
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,200
Yes.

442
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,200
Yes.

443
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,400
l catch you fuckin' this machine again,
l'll break your neck.

444
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,100
- Sorry, Chief.
- Looks like safe sex to me.

445
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,200
- Show me.
- Okay.

446
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:06,400
Here we go. The ripple was steady
at four, then spiked past five to six.

447
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,000
On the board, it looks
like it set off Waimea.

448
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,400
Somebody's really doing a number.

449
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,800
We've located the point
of origin and...

450
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,700
- it's right here in Washington.
- Shit.

451
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,300
Come on.
You're out of here.

452
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,400
You should have an exhibit.

453
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:26,200
Oh, really? All my best stuff's
at home.

454
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,600
l really could care less
whether you like me or not...

455
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,500
but you don't know
a thing about me.

456
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,100
T minus three minutes and counting.

457
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,000
l've been with l.A. for two years.

458
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,800
l'm field-rated in weapons and tactics
and speak three languages. lmpressed?

459
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,100
- l'm blown away.
- l read the Atwood file.

460
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,100
You didn't mention you could read.

461
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,500
He was your friend,
and you still asked to go after him.

462
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,500
- He crossed the line.
- Or he crossed you.

463
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,000
Launch sequence activated.

464
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,700
Authorized personnel only in the area.

465
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,800
She looks just like the Vollmers!

466
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,000
T minus two minutes and counting.

467
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,900
Why is everyone so nervous?

468
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,900
When a launch goes wrong,
they're the guys who scrape the wall.

469
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,100
And you do look like
the Vollmer twins.

470
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
Who are the Vollmer twins?

471
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,600
Launch personnel only in the bay.

472
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,700
T minus one minute 30 seconds
and counting.

473
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,500
Magnetic field polarity
initiation in ten seconds.

474
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,600
Telemetry check is initiated.

475
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,200
Are we gonna blast to the past!

476
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,400
Yee-hah!

477
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,800
Green for launch!

478
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,200
l've run dozens
of simulated launches...

479
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,300
but l-l never noticed
that wall before.

480
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,100
- ''Simulated''?
- This is my first real launch.

481
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,300
Great. Don't stick
your head out of the window.

482
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,600
- She's a little shaky.
- Blood pressure'll loosen her teeth.

483
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,500
Her pulse is pushing 140.

484
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,600
lf she farts, she'll get
ahead of the pod.

485
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,100
Fielding, listen to me.
it helps to concentrate...

486
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,300
on something relaxing
during a launch.

487
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,700
What do you think about?

488
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,100
Not swallowing my tongue.

489
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,300
- How's Walker?
- You'd have to shake him...

490
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,700
to be sure he's awake.

491
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,200
- He's awake.
-T minus 30 seconds.

492
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,700
29... 28... 27... 26...

493
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,700
25... 24... 23...
22... 21... 20...

494
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,100
- Have they ever lost a pod?
- Ask the Vollmers.

495
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,000
- Where are they?
- See those two red spots?

496
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,600
12... 11... 10...

497
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,100
- Oh, God.
- Nine... eight... seven...

498
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,600
Six... five... four...

499
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,800
Three... two... one...

500
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,300
Zero.

501
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,100
They're away.

502
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,300
ls this the hottest thing or what?

503
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,600
Goddamn Ricky.

504
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,200
So much for a dry run.

505
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,300
We're alive.

506
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,500
- Are we where we're supposed to be?
- Give me a date.

507
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,900
Sunday, October 9, 1994.

508
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,500
Target.

509
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,900
- We're close.
- October 9?

510
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,800
- l'll be 16 tomorrow.
- Where?

511
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:42,300
l was living in Colorado.
Man, this is weird. Whew.

512
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,500
Yeah? Well, don't get sentimental
and try to visit yourself.

513
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,300
l'd like to call myself, tell me not to
sleep with Bobby Morgan after my party.

514
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,300
lt's really disappointing.

515
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,600
A smart woman
would call Bobby...

516
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,000
and give him
some advice.

517
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,500
Aw, yeah, right.

518
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,600
- How long was Atwood your partner?
- Three years.

519
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:14,300
- Was it difficult to bring him back?
- What do you think?

520
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,300
You got a family?
Hmm?

521
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,900
Mine's still in Colorado.

522
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,100
When my dad started
reading about time travel...

523
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,300
he said it was a bigger threat
to the world than the nuclear bomb.

524
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,500
He's right.

525
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,500
That's why l joined the agency.

526
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,500
The world should be able to party
on Saturday night...

527
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,300
and not worry whether the planet's
going to be here on Monday.

528
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,200
- You sound like a woman l knew.
- Someone remarkable, l hope.

529
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,100
- Yeah.

530
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,500
Someone you knew, huh?
So, where is she?

531
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,400
She was killed.

532
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,300
Sorry.

533
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,900
You must've thought
about going back and changing that.

534
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,600
We're here.

535
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,300
Huh.

536
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,800
l thought it was
just Parker Datalink.

537
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,100
Take the back
and wait for my call.

538
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,000
Keep your head down.
Tomorrow's your birthday.

539
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,200
- l have a problem.
- You do?

540
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,100
Yes. Let me tell you
what my problem is.

541
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,900
This isn't working.
l can't keep paying for this.

542
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
- Hey, it doesn't matter to me.
- Oh, but it should, Jack.

543
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,900
You're taking the goddamn company
into bankruptcy.

544
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,800
We have a difference of opinion.

545
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,500
The chip is the future of this company.

546
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,700
- Since you don't agree, walk away.
- This isn't the first time
we've had this conversation.

547
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,300
Come up with money
and l'm out of here.

548
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,600
You know l can't afford it...

549
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:18,500
but l've found an enterprising
banker with faith in the future.

550
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,300
Take it.

551
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,500
You're out.
You've got no faith in the company...

552
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,900
and l've got none in politicians.

553
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:44,500
lf l were you,
l wouldn't cash that check.

554
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,700
lt's gonna cost you
more than you'll ever know.

555
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,700
Hey, Jack, it's been a while.

556
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,500
- What is this?
- lt's me.

557
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,400
Well, it's, it's him.

558
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,800
No, it's us.

559
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,900
W-W-Where did you come from?

560
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:09,000
- Are you his father?
- Do l look that old?

561
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:13,800
l'm a United States senator.
Hurting me is a federal offense.

562
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,300
- l don't know about Jack's business.
- Will you stop it?

563
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,900
J-Just stop it.
Get a grip.

564
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
l remember having bigger balls.

565
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,000
l'm gonna have to get
this fixed. Right--

566
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,400
Don't touch me.

567
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,000
Same matter can't occupy
the same space.

568
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,400
Same matter?

569
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,700
So, you got
a special N.S.A. briefing coming up.

570
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,900
Secret session.

571
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
That's not for another week.

572
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:51,500
Time travel, someone says,
gets a big laugh.

573
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,600
Oh, Christ, you're me.

574
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,400
How far back have you come?

575
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,300
Never interrupt me
when l'm talking to myself.

576
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,500
- We're gonna take them.
- What's the signal?

577
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,100
You were a visionary.
The computer market was saturated.

578
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,100
The software stocks
were in the toilet...

579
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,600
and your fuckin' coldware
revolutionizes the industry.

580
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,900
l made a mistake.

581
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,100
-l came to tell you l changed my mind.
-Now.

582
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:37,700
Freeze!

583
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,400
Do you realize how inappropriate
that word is? Do l look frozen to you?

584
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,900
You look like shit to me.
Get away from him!

585
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,700
Move!

586
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,500
Drop the guns, now.

587
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,100
Under your jacket there's
a track-and-return module.

588
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,700
Throw it to me.

589
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,500
You, uh, gonna
leave me back here?

590
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,300
Do it.

591
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:16,000
Agent Walker, l wanna see how you get
down here and keep the gun on us.

592
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,000
What are you gonna do?
You gonna jump?

593
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,500
That's how the Vollmers
would do it.

594
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,800
Move back.

595
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,700
Give me the envelope.

596
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,700
Thank you.

597
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:43,000
The country's going down the drain
because of the special interests.

598
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:46,900
We need someone rich in the White House
who doesn't have to listen to anybody.

599
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,100
- What's that?
- The senator was having a fund-raiser.

600
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,500
When l'm in office,
it's gonna be like the '80s.

601
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:57,500
Top 10%% will get richer, the rest can
emigrate to Mexico, live a better life.

602
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,700
So, you goin' or stayin'?

603
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,400
l think you plan too far ahead.

604
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,600
Obviously, you don't.

605
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,800
Anything else you want
to tell me about yourself?

606
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,300
Don't tell anyone l killed ya.
l'm out on bail.

607
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,900
Okay, let's finish up
and get out of here.

608
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,400
He's running for president.
l'm voting early.

609
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,600
Good seeing you again, Jack.

610
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,900
Maybe he'll calm down
after the election.

611
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,800
What's the big deal?

612
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,200
Point it, pull the trigger...

613
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,400
and, boom, somebody dies.

614
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,700
Get up there!
Get the module!

615
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,700
Fuckin' great!
Will you get him?

616
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,900
Goddamn it.

617
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,600
Oh!

618
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,900
Aaron!

619
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,000
Come here.

620
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,100
You own the company,
do you understand?

621
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:01,000
The chip is going to be worth billions,
my billions.

622
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,900
Now, read this.
Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

623
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,800
You just read it
and do what it says.

624
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,700
Now, you get out of here.

625
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,000
Oh. And will you do me a favor?

626
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,100
Will you lay off
the fuckin' candy bars?

627
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,600
Have a nice day.

628
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,300
- l should've said, ''Freeze.''
- l think he got the idea.

629
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,600
Do me a favor.
Don't give up without a fight.

630
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,400
Never crossed my mind.

631
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,400
l don't want
to fight a woman.

632
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,300
Then don't.

633
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,200
Changed my mind.

634
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,300
Tell me he's gonna
kill your family.

635
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,700
- Don't you leave me, damn it!
- Who are you talking to?

636
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,700
Stay here, Walker.

637
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,300
ln my future, you're dead.

638
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,300
Look at this!

639
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,500
Let's get a canine unit
up there.

640
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,500
- What the hell's going on here?
- You're lucky you got back.

641
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,400
They're gettin' ready
to tear up these tracks.

642
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,800
- McComb?
- Who else?

643
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,200
- He hasn't got the power.
- Are you kiddin'?

644
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:49,400
He's ahead in the polls. He's probably
out buying running shoes for his team.

645
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:54,300
Senate committee caved in. They want
to be on the good side of the new boss.

646
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,300
What's the matter?
lt's been headed this way for months.

647
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,200
When l left,
nothing had happened.

648
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,500
Hey, Walker, when they tear up the
launcher, you get the pod as a memento.

649
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,500
He's changed the future.

650
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,400
What are you talking about?

651
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:12,300
McComb.
He's buying the presidency.

652
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,200
What's new?
lt's been done before.

653
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,100
- The guy is a killer.
- Doesn't surprise me.

654
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,300
- He killed my agency.
- He shot two people.

655
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:23,700
- Who?
- Who? A guy named Parker and Fielding.

656
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,000
- Do l know them?
- Fielding was with me.

657
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,900
- You sent her.
- l don't like this guy one bit...

658
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:35,300
but just who can l sell this story to
without 50 eyewitnesses?

659
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,500
- How about one?
- You don't count.

660
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:41,300
There's a chance she's still alive.

661
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,000
- Who?
- Fielding. The cops were there.

662
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,000
l'm gonna be looking
for a new government job.

663
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,000
l don't think it will
help my chances...

664
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,700
if l'm the guy that tried to put
our next president in jail.

665
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,900
- You think l'm making this up?
- Forget it! You're not going back!

666
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,100
lf she's alive, we've got him.

667
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,000
You understand that?
We've got the guy.

668
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,600
We're shut down.
Take a look around. We're history.

669
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,900
Wait, l'm gonna
show you something.

670
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,300
You come with me.

671
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,500
Those files are supposed to be sealed.
l don't know why l'm doing this.

672
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,500
You say you were my best friend?

673
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,700
- For a long time.
- l liked you?

674
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:18,600
- Oh, yeah.
- What are you looking for?

675
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:22,600
Fielding's friends or family;
anyone she would go to in 1994.

676
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:26,100
- Who was she?
- l.A., but she had a deal with McComb.

677
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,500
He's got to go back
to be sure she's dead.

678
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,800
Since you say
we were close friends...

679
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:37,100
l'm gonna ask you a question
the prison psychiatrist will ask you.

680
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,200
How's our leading
presidential candidate...

681
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,800
making these expeditions into the past
without our equipment, old pal?

682
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:47,200
The prototype was never dismantled.

683
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,200
Kleindast's.
lt's in Calverton, Maryland.

684
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,800
Short drive from Washington.

685
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,400
We have no authority
to get in there.

686
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,800
What about Ricky?

687
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,400
lf you were my best friend,
you wouldn't do this to me.

688
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,100
l would have had him killed
right here, but if he's back...

689
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,000
he's already told the story to Matuzak.
God knows who else.

690
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:18,900
They won't get it, but they'll sure
give it thought if he comes up dead.

691
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,800
- Right.
- He'll have to be erased.

692
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:22,900
Erased.

693
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,600
Have him killed
before he joined T.E.C.

694
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,400
That way nobody in the Agency
ever talked to him or even knew him.

695
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,000
-Perfect.
-lt's not perfect. lt's all we've got.

696
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,900
Don't expect to be
my chief of staff...

697
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,800
if slamming you
into the side of the car...

698
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,900
turns you into a sniveling worm.

699
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,800
Well, what do you know?

700
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:50,600
At random intervals, Maryland Utilities
shows spikes in demand and duration...

701
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,700
- that are almost identical to ours.
- Send me back.

702
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,200
- No, they won't let us do that.
- Stay out of it, Ricky.

703
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,300
Would it be too much trouble
to call me Richard?

704
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,200
Richard, do l have
a best friend around here?

705
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,200
lt isn't me.
Maybe Gordon.

706
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,200
Gordon is a putz. l can tell you
who my best friend was...

707
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,200
in school, in the marines,
when l was a cop.

708
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,100
Gordon doesn't fit.
l'm not saying you do...

709
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,500
but since l'd like to see McComb take a
fall, you get the benefit of the doubt.

710
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,400
- Whoa! Where you goin'?
- We've got to vent the fuel shunts.

711
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,100
Oh, is that right? You'll have
to wait while l get authori--

712
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,300
Was l your only friend?

713
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,500
A launch is not
a one-man operation.

714
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,400
Yeah, l know.

715
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,500
lf l'm off on velocity or trajectory,
you're gonna be an omelette.

716
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,500
- You trying to scare me?
- Yeah.

717
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:42,200
- Just hit the right year.
- l'll see ya.

718
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:46,400
l've had your wife's goulash
a hundred times; always too much salt.

719
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,600
Here goes the pension.

720
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,500
Emergency launch system
on-line warning.

721
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:03,100
Emergency launch system
on-line warning.

722
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,400
Manual launch
initiation alert.

723
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,700
Manual launch
initiation alert.

724
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,900
Shut it down! Now!

725
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,400
Telemetry on-line.
lgnition firing on-line.

726
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,300
- Launch now on hold for--
- Last chance!

727
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,200
Launch is now--

728
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,600
- Launch now on hold--

729
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,600
Damn it!

730
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,700
Get me the police mainframe computer.

731
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,800
l want all Jane Does admitted
to local hospitals on October 9.

732
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:09,500
Check if any of the Jane Does
are victims of multiple gunshot wounds.

733
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,400
Gotcha.

734
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:44,000
Dr. Lemon, call line one-five.

735
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,900
Dr. Lemon, call line one-five.

736
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,900
Police. Jane Doe.

737
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,600
Happy birthday.

738
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:17,200
Thanks.
Get me anything?

739
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,100
- Tell me what you want.
- l want to go home.

740
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:23,600
l already know who's gonna
win the next ten World Series.

741
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:27,600
- No problem.
- Why'd you come back?

742
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,400
l need you to testify
against McComb.

743
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:34,700
Mmm.
That would be my pleasure.

744
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,000
- lt could be dangerous.
- l know that.

745
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,500
lt's not that simple.
McComb has made some changes.

746
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:43,800
- You were never in the T.E.C.
- No, that can't be.

747
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,100
l had the training for six years.

748
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,300
- l have friends.
- l've got to move fast.

749
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,000
lf l can find you, so can he.

750
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
What can l do?

751
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:57,500
l need proof
that you existed here.

752
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:01,600
ln case l don't
make the trip, huh?

753
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,900
They just took some blood.

754
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,900
lt would be in the lab.

755
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,300
- l'll be right back.
- Hey.

756
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:14,200
- l really screwed up.
- Yes, you did.

757
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,400
l want to make things right.

758
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:22,000
You may find you can make
things right for yourself.

759
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,000
l'll be right back.

760
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,600
Wheelchair to Admitting,
please. Wheelchair to Admitting.

761
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,900
Dr. Ryan,
report to Obstetrics.

762
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,900
Dr. Ryan,
report to Obstetrics.

763
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,800
Nurse Remington,
report to main desk.

764
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,800
Nurse Remington,
report to the main desk.

765
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:33,800
Melissa.

766
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
l'm gonna take you
to someplace safe.

767
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
What are you doing?

768
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,300
Help! Security!

769
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:17,000
Help! Security!
Somebody call security!

770
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:21,100
Help!

771
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,400
Security!
Call security!

772
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,200
Hey! Hold it!
Don't move!

773
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,300
Pictures bring back
your memories.

774
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,800
- This is for what you're going to do.
- Hey, wha--

775
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:24,400
- What the--

776
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:38,700
- Melissa... don't turn around.
- Why? What's wrong?

777
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,800
lt's okay.

778
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,800
- Listen. Listen.
- Who are you?

779
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:47,000
lt's me. Look.
lt's Max.

780
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,700
Max? Max, what happened?

781
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,900
l can't tell you right now.
We have to go.

782
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,900
Trust me.

783
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Trust me.

784
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,900
Come on.

785
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,200
Let's go.

786
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:15,200
Here! Here!

787
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:21,800
Please! Just tell me
what happened to you!

788
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Just try to believe me.
l love you.

789
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,100
Trust me.

790
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,500
- You're not Max.
- lt's me.

791
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,500
Ten years from now,
it's me.

792
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,500
- That's not possible.
- Remember:

793
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:07,200
- Matuzak, the new job, time travel.
- Time travel?

794
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:11,600
lf one day l need a birdhouse built,
l know who to talk to.

795
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:15,100
- Oh, my god.
- lt's me. lt's Max.

796
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:19,600
- l can't believe this.
- Try.

797
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,600
What am l like
ten years from now?

798
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,500
Just like now.

799
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,500
Perfect.

800
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:36,100
You time traveled,
and what? Why?

801
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,000
Let me show you.

802
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,600
Today you have something
very special to tell him.

803
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,300
- How do you know that?
- l've just told you.

804
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,800
What are you here to prevent?

805
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,600
Changes in the past.

806
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:09,200
Why? What's gonna happen?

807
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,700
Later. Stay and meet with him.

808
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,800
Don't tell him
anything, please.

809
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,300
There's never enough time.

810
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:10,200
Never enough for what?

811
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:13,100
To satisfy a woman.

812
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,700
Then you never want
to miss an opportunity.

813
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,800
- Are you busy?
- l'm meeting my husband.

814
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:32,200
Senator McComb!
Sir!

815
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:36,000
That message came
from the senate operator, sir.

816
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,500
- lt's 3:30. You have a 4:00 with--
- Clear my schedule.

817
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,500
- All of it.
- Yes, sir.

818
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,400
Kelly, have you ever been
inside the president's limo?

819
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,300
No, sir.

820
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,500
You keep in touch.

821
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,600
l'll send you a photograph of it.

822
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,700
l have something l want to tell you.

823
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,600
- Oh, shit.
- Don't answer it.

824
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:18,000
l have to.

825
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:28,400
- Did not tell him?
- He didn't give me a chance.

826
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:32,300
You should have tried.

827
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,300
Are we still together
in ten years?

828
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,000
Yes, we're together.

829
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,100
- Do you have a picture?
- No, nothing recent.

830
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:50,400
- Am l dead?
- No. You're not dead.

831
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,400
What about tomorrow?

832
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,100
Everything is going
to be fine, okay?

833
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:59,400
Why can't we just get out? Why can't we
just run away from whatever it is?

834
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:02,400
lt would come back
as many times as it takes.

835
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,400
lt has to end tonight.

836
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,200
Hurry!
Keep him upstairs.

837
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:11,200
Whatever you do,
keep him upstairs.

838
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:14,500
Just do what l say.
Please! Go!

839
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,600
Max, l don't want you to go.

840
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:31,200
l'll be back soon.

841
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,600
l-- l'm pregnant.

842
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:38,300
- Great.
- l love you.

843
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,200
- Surprise.
- Who the fuck are you?

844
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,200
Friend of the family.

845
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:01,700
Don't go down!

846
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:28,100
Upstairs.

847
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,000
- How did you miss him?
- He knew it was comin'.

848
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:31,700
lt was a T.E.C. cop.

849
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,800
Son of a bitch
doesn't know how to die.

850
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:35,300
He'll learn tonight.

851
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,800
You don't kill him,
you don't go back.

852
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Upstairs.

853
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,400
Max.

854
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,700
Oh, my god, Max.
Look out!

855
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:04,100
You have nothing soft
to land on, do you?

856
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,800
Go! Go!

857
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,800
- l'll get help!
- Go!

858
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:58,100
Say, ''Ah.''

859
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,100
Oh, shit.

860
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,900
Boy, that's gotta hurt.

861
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,500
Lousy night to be out.

862
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,000
Don't hurt her.

863
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:18,500
You were at a disadvantage
in this from the beginning.

864
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,800
l'm an ambitious
Harvard-educated visionary...

865
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:23,300
who deserves to be
the most powerful man in the world...

866
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:26,500
and you, you're a fuckin' idiot
who never figured out...

867
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:30,100
that the only way to make anything of
all that fancy kicking is on Broadway.

868
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,900
Thanks for clearing that up.

869
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:33,800
The polls have me winning
by 28 points.

870
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:36,500
That's the biggest landslide
since Nixon back in '72.

871
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:40,600
l find it reassuring to know
what the future holds, don't you?

872
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,700
That's C-4.

873
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:47,300
lt'll turn this house into dust
and also separate every part of you...

874
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:50,400
- from every other part of you.
- Let her go. You've got me.

875
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:53,900
l don't want you.
Agent Walker is too visible.

876
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:59,100
But Officer Walker, dead,
is just another D.C. statistic.

877
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:02,300
When he's gone,
you're gone.

878
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,200
Get the younger one.
l want him to see this.

879
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:06,300
- He's dead.
- No, he's not, you moron.

880
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,200
lf he were dead,
he would not be here. Get him.

881
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:12,300
Let her go!

882
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:20,900
- What do you want?
- You're a bright boy.

883
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,200
Why don't you sleep on it?

884
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,200
l did that.

885
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:04,700
lt's different
than before, isn't it?

886
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,500
lt's what happens
when you change time.

887
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:10,300
Lines of confluence,
probability scales, all that shit.

888
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:14,800
Put your gun
on the floor.

889
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:17,900
What were you gonna do? Shoot me?

890
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:22,900
A bomb is gonna go off any second now.
You know what happens then?

891
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,100
We're all gonna be dead.
l'm gonna win by default.

892
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,300
My young self
is still gonna be president...

893
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,900
and you can't save your wife.

894
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:32,400
Just like you couldn't
save her once before.

895
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:34,900
She died because you came back
and made some changes.

896
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,300
Now you're gonna
fuck with time.

897
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:41,400
- You're as bad as me.
- Wrong. l'm setting it right.

898
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,200
Usually l hate doing things
more than once...

899
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:47,300
but in this case,
l don't see any other option.

900
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,700
l do.

901
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:54,400
What the fuck are you doing here?

902
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:57,000
You called me. You left a message
with the senate operator.

903
01:23:57,100 --> 01:24:00,100
l didn't leave any message,
you fucking idiot!

904
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,300
Don't argue among yourself.
l left it.

905
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,800
Now nobody's got a future.

906
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:08,900
Okay.
This is a real mess now.

907
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:11,100
l hope you're happy.
This is a real mess.

908
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:13,800
You turned a simple, ordinary murder
into a bloodbath.

909
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:19,800
You get out of here. Get out of here.
Go! Now! Go!

910
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,900
- You two should be closer.
- Keep him away from me.

911
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,900
The same matter
can't occupy the same space.

912
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:32,400
l'm still kicking.
l must be on Broadway.

913
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,400
No!

914
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,400
Coordinates downloaded
to G.P.S. sequencer.

915
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,500
Re-entry sequence
is completed.

916
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:23,500
Launch bay alert
is now terminated.

917
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:51,100
Hey, where you goin'?

918
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:55,700
- What happened to you?
- What are you talkin' about?

919
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,800
You're walking around.

920
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:02,800
l've been doing that since l was
about two. Does that seem abnormal?

921
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:06,600
l--

922
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:12,500
- What's going on with Senator McComb?
- Senator McComb?

923
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:15,700
lf you want time off, ask. Don't act
like you're out of your head.

924
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:19,300
- l've got a blank spot.
- You've got a hole in your head.

925
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:22,600
Ten years ago, McComb left his office,
