(Sonar Pings)

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,300
Okay, take her up
and over the bow rail.

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,400
(Over Radio):
Okay, Mir 2,we're going over the bow.

Okay, quiet. We're rolling.

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,600
Seeing her coming out of
the darkness like a ghost ship

12
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,600
still gets me every time...

13
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:22,200
To see the sad ruin
of the great ship sitting here

in the morning of April 15, 1912

Yeah, Brock... Launching Dunkin now.
Go, Charlie.

31
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,200
- All right, tether out.
- Man: Tether out.

32

Man (Over Radio): Okay, Brock,
we're dropping down along the hull.

33
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,100
Roger that. Okay, drop down and go
into the first-class gangway door.

We're headed down the stairwell.

40
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,800
Okay, Lewis, drop down to B deck.
A deck.

Right there. That's it!

get closer.

- Take it easy, it might come apart.
- Okay.

62

Go, go, go, go.
Flip it over. Flip it over. Go.

would like to know how it's going.

Hey, Dave, Barry, hi.
Look, it wasn't in the safe

00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
but hey, hey,
don't worry about it.

85

There's still plenty
of places it could be.

Hell yes! Floor debris in the suite, the

- Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.
- Brock: A dozen other places.

Guys, look, you've just got to trust
my instincts. I know we're close.

89
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,200
We just got to go through
a little process of elimination.

90
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,000
Hang on a second.

91
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,300
- Let me see that.
- We might have something here, guys.

92
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,100
Where's the photograph
of the necklace?

It's okay.
I'll feed you in a minute.

97
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,300
Now he has chartered
Russian subs to reach

98
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,400
the most famous shipwreck
of all: The Titanic.

via satellite

100
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,500
from the research ship Keldysh
in the North Atlantic.

00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,300
- Hello, Brock.
- Brock: Hello, Tracy.

102
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,900
Everyone knows the familiar
stories of Titanic...

103
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,900
the nobility, the band playing
till the very end and all that.

104
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,400
But what I'm interested in
are the untold stories

105
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,200
the secrets locked deep
inside the hull of Titanic.

106
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,700
We're out here using
robot technology

107
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,500
to go further into the wreck
than anybody's ever done before.

108
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,800
Your expedition is at the center
of a storm of controversy

109
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,900
over salvage rights
and even ethics.

110
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,900
Many are calling you
a grave robber.

111
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,200
Nobody called the recovery of artifacts
of King Tut's tomb "grave robbing."

112
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,400
- Woman: What is it?
- Turn that up, dear.

113
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,400
I have museum-trained experts
out here making sure

114
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,100
that these relics are preserved
and catalogued properly.

115
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,000
Take a look at this drawing
that we found just today:

116
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,100
A piece of paper that's been
underwater for 84 years

117
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,000
and my team were able
to preserve it intact.

118
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,700
Should this have remained unseen at
the bottom of the ocean for eternity?

119
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
I'll be goddamned.

There's a satellite call for you.

122
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,000
Bobby, we're launching. You see
these submersibles going in the water?

123
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,800
Trust me, buddy.
You want to take this call.

124
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,100
This better be good.

125
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,300
You got to speak up.
She's kind of old.

126
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,100
Great. This Brock Lovett.

127
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,800
- How can I help you, Mrs...
- Calvert. Rose Calvert.

128
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,800
Mrs. Calvert?

129
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,100
I was just wondering if you had found
the Heart of the Ocean yet, Mr. Lovett.

130
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,300
Told you you wanted
to take the call.

131
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,100
All right, you have
my attention, Rose.

132
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,100
Can you tell us who the woman
in the picture is?

133
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,500
Oh, yes.
The woman in the picture is me.

134
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,100
(Yelling Over Engine Noise):
She's a goddamned liar...

135
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,600
Some nut case seeking
money or publicity.

136
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,600
God only knows why, like that
Russian babe, Anesthesia.

137
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,900
They're inbound!

138
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,500
Rose Dewitt Bukater died on the Titanic
when she was 17, right?

139
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,500
- That's right.
- If she had lived, she'd be over 100.

140
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,900
101 next month.

141
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,100
Okay, so she's a very old
goddamned liar.

142
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,000
Look, I've already done
the background on this woman

143
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,500
all the way back to the '20s
when she was working as an actress.

144
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,800
An actress! There's
your first clue, Sherlock.

145
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,300
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

146
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,700
They move to Cedar Rapids
and she punches out a couple of kids.

147
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,200
Now, Calvert's dead, and from what
I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.

148
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,300
And everybody who
knows about the diamond

149
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,200
is supposed to be dead
or on this boat, but she knows.

150
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,100
Doesn't exactly
travel light, does she?

151
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,900
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.
Welcome to the Keldysh.

152
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,600
Okay, let's get her
inside there.

153
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,600
- Hi, Ms. Calvert.
- Hi.

154
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,000
Welcome to the Keldysh.

155
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,900
Man:
Hey. Hey!

156
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,400
- (Knocking)
- Rose: Yes?

157
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,400
- Are your staterooms all right?
- Rose: Oh, yes, very nice.

158
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,600
Have you met
my granddaughter Lizzie?

159
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,300
She takes care of me.

160
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,500
We met just
a few minutes ago.

161
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,000
Remember, Nana, up on deck?

162
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,700
There, that's nice.

163
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,500
Have to have my pictures
when I travel.

164
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,100
Can I get you anything?
Is there anything you'd like?

165
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
Yes.

166
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,100
I would like to see my drawing.

167
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,200
Brock:
Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone

168
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,200
that was called
the Blue Diamond of the Crown

169
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,300
which disappeared in 1792

170
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,200
about the same time old Louis
lost everything from the neck up.

171
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,900
The theory goes that
the crown diamond was chopped, too

172
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,900
recut into a heart-like shape that
became known as "Heart of the Ocean."

173
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,700
Today it would be worth more
than the Hope Diamond.

174
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,700
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.
I only wore it this once.

175
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,400
Lizzie:
You actually think this is you, Nana?

176
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,200
It is me, dear.
Wasn't I a dish?

177
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,900
I tracked it down
through insurance records...

178
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,900
An old claim that was settled
under terms of absolute secrecy.

179
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,000
Can you tell me
who the claimant was, Rose?

180
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,700
I should imagine
someone named Hockley.

181
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,100
Brock: Nathan Hockley, that's right.
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

182
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Claim was for
a diamond necklace

183
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,300
his son Caledon
bought his fiancee... you

184
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,400
a week before
he sailed on Titanic.

185
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,500
It was filed right
after the sinking

186
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,700
so the diamond had to have
gone down with the ship.

187
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,500
You see the date?

188
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,800
"April 14, 1912."

189
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,600
Which means if your grandmother is
who she says she is

190
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,800
she was wearing the diamond
the day the Titanicsank.

191
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,300
And that makes you
my new best friend.

192
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,800
These are some of the things
we recovered from your stateroom.

193
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,700
This was mine.

194
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,600
How extraordinary!

195
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,100
And it looks the same as it did
the last time I saw it.

196
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,600
The reflection
has changed a bit.

197
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,800
(Gasps Quietly)

198
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,700
Are you ready to go
back to Titanic?

199
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,500
Lewis: Okay, here we go. She hits
the berg on the starboard side, right?

200
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,700
She kind of bumps along punching holes
like Morse code... dit-dit-dit...

201
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,400
along the side,
below the waterline.

202
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,600
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

203
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,700
Now as the water level rises, it
spills over the watertight bulkheads

204
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,500
which unfortunately
don't go any higher than E deck.

205
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,200
So now as the bow goes down,
the stern rises up

206
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,000
slow at first, then faster
and faster until finally

207
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,600
she's got her whole ass is sticking
up in the air and that's a big ass.

208
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,400
We're talking
20,000, 30,000 tons, okay?

209
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,800
And the hull's not designed to deal
with that pressure, so what happens?

210
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,100
She splits,
right down to the keel

211
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,500
and the stern
falls back level.

212
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:42,400
Then as the bow sinks, it pulls the
stern vertical and finally detaches.

213
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,600
Now, the stern section just
kind of bobs there like a cork

214
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,100
for a couple of minutes, floods and
finally goes under about 2:20 a.m.

215
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,800
Two hours and 40 minutes
after the collision.

216
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,500
The bow section planes away
landing about a half a mile away

217
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,300
going 20, 30 knots when
it hits the ocean floor.

218
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,400
(Imitates Crashing)

219
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,400
Pretty cool, huh?

220
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Thank you for that fine
forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.

221
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Of course,
the experience of it was

222
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,800
somewhat different.

223
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,300
Will you share it with us?

224
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
(Music Playing)

225
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,900
(Crying)

226
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,200
- I'm taking her to rest.
- No.

227
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,700
- Come on, Nana.
- No!

228
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,700
Tape recorder.

229
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Tell us, Rose.

230
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,200
It's been 84 years.

231
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,700
It's okay. Just try to remember
anything... anything at all.

232
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,600
Do you want to hear this
or not, Mr. Lovett?

233
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,500
It's been 84 years...

234
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,900
and I can still smell
the fresh paint.

235
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,900
The china had never been used.

236
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,000
The sheets had never
been slept in.

237
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:08,500
Titanicwas called
"The Ship of Dreams"

238
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,100
and it was, it really was.

239
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,700
Man: All third-class passengers
with a forward berth

240
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,100
this way, please, this queue.

241
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,400
- Right here.
- Big boat, huh?

242
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,800
- Daddy, it's a ship.
- You're right.

243
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,100
(Car Horn Tooting)

244
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
I don't see what
all the fuss is about.

245
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,000
It doesn't look any bigger
than the Mauritania.

246
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,600
You can be blase about some things,
Rose, but not about Titanic.

247
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,200
It's over 100 feet longer than
Mauritania and far more luxurious.

248
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,100
Your daughter is far too difficult
to impress, Ruth.

249
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,600
So this is the ship
they say is unsinkable.

250
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,600
It is unsinkable.
God Himself could not sink this ship.

251
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,700
Sir, you have to check
your baggage through the main terminal.

252
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,600
- It's round that way, sir.
- I put my faith in you, good sir.

253
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,200
- Now, kindly see my man.
- Yes, sir, my pleasure, sir.

254
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,700
- If I can do anything at all.
- Oh, yes, right.

255
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,200
All the trunks
from that car there

256

12 from here, and the safe...

257
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,900
to the parlor suite,
rooms B-52, 54, 56.

- Ladies...

259
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,400
better hurry.

- My coat?
- Woman: I have it.

262
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,900
Man: All third-class passengers
due here for a health inspection.

263

All third-class passengers
due here for health inspection.

264
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,800
Head up.

265
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,500
Welcome aboard, ma'am.
Welcome to Titanic.

266
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,800
Rose: It was the Ship of Dreams
to everyone else.

267
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,500
To me it was a slave ship

268
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,700
taking me back to America
in chains.

269
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,000
Outwardly, I was everything
a well-brought-up girl should be.

270
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,800
Inside, I was screaming.

Jack, you are pazzo.
You bet everything we have.

you got nothing to lose.

00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,200
- We're Americans, both of us.
- Right, come aboard.

306
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,300
We're the luckiest sons of bitches
in the world, you know that?

307

(Ship's Horn Blares)

308
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,600
Good-bye!

309
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,400
- You know somebody?
- Of course not. That's not the point.

310
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,400
Good-bye! I'll miss you!

311
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,200
Good-bye! I'm going
to never forget you.

(Crowd Cheering)

313
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,400
All the way, darling.

314
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,200
360, 360.

315
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,900
Excuse me, ma'am.

316
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,200
Oh, right here.
Hey, how you doing?

317
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,600
Jack. Nice to meet you.

318
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,700
I'm Jack Dawson.
Nice to meet you.

319
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,500
How you doing?
Who says you get the top bunk?

320
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,000
(Speaking Swedish)

321
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,400
This is your private
promenade deck, sir.

322
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,500
Would you be
requiring anything?

323
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,500
- Hmm.
- Excuse me.

324
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,400
- Woman: This one?
- Rose: No. It had a lot of faces on it.

325
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,500
This is the one.

326
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,700
Would you like
all of them out, miss?

327
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,000
Yes, we need a little color
in this room.

328
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,000
Put it in there,
in the wardrobe.

329
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,000
God, not those finger paintings again.
They certainly were a waste of money.

330
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,600
The difference between Cal's taste
in art and mine is that I have some.

331
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:00,100
They're fascinating, like being
inside a dream or something.

332
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,200
- There's truth, but no logic.
- What's the artist's name?

333
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,300
- Something Picasso.
- "Something Picasso."

334
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,400
He won't amount to a thing.
He won't, trust me.

335
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,600
- Put the Degas in the bedroom.
- At least they were cheap.

336
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,200
Ah, put it in the wardrobe.

337
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,400
At Cherbourg, a woman came
aboard named Margaret Brown.

338
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,400
We all called her Molly.

339
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,900
History would call her
"the Unsinkable Molly Brown."

340
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,500
Well, I wasn't about to wait
all day for you, sonny.

341
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,100
Here, you think you can manage?

342
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,300
Her husband had struck gold
someplace out West

343
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,500
and she was what mother called
"new money."

344
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,600
By the next afternoon, we were steaming
west from the coast of Ireland

345
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,400
with nothing out ahead of us
but ocean.

346
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,000
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.

347
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,400
- Let's stretch her legs.
- Yes, sir.

348
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,400
- All ahead full, Mr. Moody.
- Very good, sir.

350

- Man (Shouting): All ahead full!

351
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,300
Come on, lads. Get moving.

352
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,500

(Crew Talking And Shouting)

354
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,400
All right,
let's stoke them right up!

355
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,000
We're going full ahead!

356
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,000

357
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,500
Hey, look, look, look!
Look, look!

358
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,400
See it?

359
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,800
There's another one. See him?

360
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,300
Look at that one.
Look at him jump!

361
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,500
Whoo-hoo!

362
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,400
Whoo!

363
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,900
I can see the
Statue of Liberty already!

364
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,100
Very small, of course.

365
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,600

by the hand of man
in all history.

370
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,400
And our master shipbuilder,
Mr. Andrews here

371
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,700
designed her
from the keel plates up.

372
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,900
Well, I may have
knocked her together

373
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,400
but the idea was Mr. Ismay's.

374
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,900
He envisioned a steamer so grand
in scale and so luxurious

375
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,500
in its appointments that its
supremacy would never be challenged.

376
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,300
And here she is
willed into solid reality.

377
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
Man:
Hear, hear.

378
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,300
You know I don't
like that, Rose.

379
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,300
She knows.

380
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,300
We'll both have the lamb, rare,
with very little mint sauce.

381
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,900
Hmm, you like lamb,
right, sweet pea?

382
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,800
Are you going to cut her meat
for her, too, there, Cal?

383
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,900
Hey, uh, who thought
of the name "Titanic"?

384
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,400
- Was it you, Bruce?
- Well, yes, actually.

385
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:42,600
I wanted to convey sheer size
and the size means stability

386
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:47,000
luxury, and above all,
strength.

387
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,400
Do you know of Dr. Freud,
Mr. Ismay?

388
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,000
His ideas about the male
preoccupation with size

389
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,200
might be of particular
interest to you.

390
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,200
- What's gotten into you?
- Excuse me.

391
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,500
- I do apologize.
- She's a pistol, Cal.

392
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,400
- Hope you can handle her.
- Well, I may have to start minding...

won't I, Mrs. Brown?

Fabrizio:
The ship is nice, huh?

398
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,700
- Yeah, it's an Irish ship.
- Is English, no?

399
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,800
No, it was built in Ireland.
15,000 Irishmen built this ship.

400
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,800
Solid as a rock.
Big Irish hands.

401

That's typical. First-class dogs
come down here to take a shit.

402

in the scheme of things.

Hi. Do you make any money
with your drawings?

407
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:10,900
Oh, forget it, boyo. You'd as like
have angels fly out your arse

00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,200

to the likes of her.

(Laughs)

410
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,500
- Do you mind?
- I hope you're proud of this.

411
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,000
I saw my whole life
as if I'd already lived it...

always the same narrow people,
the same mindless chatter.

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,100
I felt like I was standing
at a great precipice

416
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,000
with no one to pull me back

No! Stay where you are.

429
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,500
Don't presume to tell me what I will
and will not do. You don't know me.

00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,800
Well, you would have
done it already.

I'm a lot more concerned

about that water being so cold.

and I'm telling you...

00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,900
water that cold,
like right down there

00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,900
at least not about anything
but the pain.

460
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:18,000
Which is why I'm not looking forward
to jumping in there after you.

461
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,600
Like I said...

462
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,800
I don't have a choice.

463
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,400
I guess I'm kind of hoping
you'll come back over the rail

464
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,700
and get me off the hook here.

465
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,400
You're crazy.

466
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,700
That's what everybody says,
but with all due respect, miss

467
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,000
I'm not the one hanging off
the back of a ship here.

468
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,200
Come on.

469
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,800
Come on, give me your hand.
You don't want to do this.

470
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,200
Whew!

471
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,300
I'm Jack Dawson.

472
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,400
Rose Dewitt Bukater.

473
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,500
I'm going to have to get you
to write that one down.

474
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,600
Come on.

475
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,800
- (Screams)
- (Grunting)

476
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,800
I got you! Come on.

477
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,900
Come on!

478
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
(Screams)
Help! Please!

479
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,900
Help! Please!

480
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,100
- Please get me!
- Listen. Listen to me.

481
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,300
I've got you. I won't let go.
Now pull yourself up. Come on.

482
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,900
(Grunts)

483
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,600
Come on. That's right.

484
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,100
You can do it.

485
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,700
I got you.

486
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,700
What's all this?

487
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:12,100
You stand back!
And don't move an inch!

488
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,700
- Fetch the master-at-arms!
- Care for a brandy?

489
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,800
Cal: This is completely unacceptable!
What made you think

490
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,900
that you could put your hands
on my fiancee?

491
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,800
- Look at me, you filth!
- Cal...

492
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,000
- What do you think you were doing?
- Cal, stop.

493
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,500
- It was an accident.
- An accident?

494
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,400
It was. Stupid really.

495
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,700
I was leaning over,
and I slipped.

496
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,800
I was leaning far over
to see the, uh...

497
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,500
uh... uh...
the, uh... uh...

498
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,600
- Propellers?
- Propellers and I slipped.

499
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,200
And I would have gone overboard
but Mr. Dawson here saved me

500
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,800
and almost went over himself.

501
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,000
You wanted to see...
She wanted to see the propellers.

502
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,500
Like I said,
women and machinery do not mix.

503
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,100
Was that the way of it?

504
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,900
Yeah. Yeah,
that was pretty much it.

505
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,700
Well, the boy's a hero then.
Good for you, son. Well done.

506
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,000
So it's all's well
and back to our brandy, eh?

507
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:22,400
Look at you. You must be freezing.
Let's get you inside.

508
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,900
Perhaps a little something
for the boy.

509
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:32,700
Of course. Mr. Lovejoy,
I think a 20 should do it.

510
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,600
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?

511
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,100
Rose is displeased.
What to do?

512
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,800
I know.

513
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,800
Perhaps you could join us
for dinner tomorrow evening

514
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,100
to regale our group
with... your heroic tale.

515
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,400
Sure, count me in.

516
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,500
Good. Settled then.

517
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,700
This should be interesting. Mmm.

518
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,200
(Whistles)

519
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,700
Can I, uh... bum a smoke?

520
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,600
You'll want to tie those.

521
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,600
It's interesting.

522
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,300
The young lady slips so suddenly
and you still had time

523
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,200
to remove your jacket
and your shoes.

524
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,200
- (Music Box Playing Tune)
- (Knock At Door)

525
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,700
(Door Opens)

526
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,300
I know you've been melancholy.

527
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,200
I don't pretend to know why.

528
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,500
I intended to save this

529
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,200
until the engagement gala

530
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,500
next week.

531
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:11,000
But I thought tonight.

532
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,200
Good gracious.

533
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,300
Perhaps as a reminder
of my feelings for you.

534
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,700
- Is it a...
- Diamond? Yes.

535
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,600
56 carats to be exact.

536
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,600
It was worn by Louis XVI

537
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,100
and they called it
"Le Coeur De La Mer."

538
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,100
Both:
The Heart of the Ocean.

539
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,100
Yes.

540
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,100
It's overwhelming.

541
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,100
Well, it's for royalty.

542
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,600
We areroyalty, Rose.

543
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,600
You know, there's nothing
I couldn't give you.

544
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,400
There's nothing I'd deny you

545
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,100
if you would not deny me.

546
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,900
Now open your heart
to me, Rose.

547
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,000
Jack: Well, I've been on my own since
I was 15 since my folks died.

548
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,300
And I had no
brothers or sisters

549
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,800
or close kin in that part
of the country.

550
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,100
So I lit on out of there
and I haven't been back since.

551
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,900
You could just call me
a tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

552
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,300
Well, Rose...

553
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,800
we've walked about a mile
around this boat deck

554
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,000
and chewed over how great
the weather's been and how I grew up

555
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,800
but I reckon that's not why
you came to talk to me, is it?

556
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,800
- Mr. Dawson, l...
- Jack.

557
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,100
Jack...

558
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,600
I want to thank you
for what you did.

559
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:05,900
Not just for... for pulling me back
but for your discretion.

560
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,900
You're welcome.

561
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,300
Look, I know
what you must be thinking.

562
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,200
Poor little rich girl.
What does she know about misery?

563
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:21,900
No. No, that's not what
I was thinking.

564
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,600
What I was thinking was
what could have happened to this girl

565
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,100
to make her think
she had no way out?

566
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,600
Well, l...

567
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,600
It was everything.

568
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,000
It was my whole world
and all the people in it

569
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,600
and the inertia of my life
plunging ahead

570
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,600
and me, powerless to stop it.

571
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,800
God! Look at that thing.

572
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,900
You would have gone
straight to the bottom.

573
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,300
500 invitations have gone out.

574
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,500
All of Philadelphia society
will be there

575
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,800
and all the while
I feel I'm...

576
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,200
standing in the middle
of a crowded room

577
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,200
screaming at the top of my lungs
and no one even looks up.

578
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,300
Do you love him?

579
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,400
- Pardon me?
- Do you love him?

580
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,600
You're being very rude.
You shouldn't be asking me this.

581
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,800
Well, it's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

582
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,100
This is not
a suitable conversation.

583
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:24,200
- Why can't you just answer the question?
- (Nervous Laughter)

584
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,600
This is absurd. You don't know me,
and I don't know you

585
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,400
and we are not having
this conversation at all.

586
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,900
You are rude and uncouth
and presumptuous and I am leaving now.

587
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,600
Jack. Mr. Dawson,
it's been a pleasure.

588
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:40,300
I sought you out to thank you
and now I have thanked you...

589
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,800
- And you've insulted me.
- Well, you deserved it.

590
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,100
- Right.
- Right.

591
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,700
- I thought you were leaving.
- I am.

592
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,000
You are so annoying.

593
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,700
- (Chuckles)
- Wait.

594
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,000
I don't have to leave.
This is my part of the ship. You leave.

595
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,500
Oh-ho-ho,
well, well, well.

596
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,100
Now who's being rude?

597
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,200
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

598
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,900
So what are you,
an artist or something?

599
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:21,600
Well, these are rather good.

600
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,000
They're, uh...
They're very good actually.

601
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,300
Jack, this is exquisite work.

602
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,300
They didn't think too much
of them in old Paree.

603
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,800
Paris! You do get around
for a poor...

604
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,200
Well, uh, uh, a person
of limited means.

605
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,400
Go on, a poor guy,
you can say it.

606
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,400
Well, well, well.

607
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,100
And these were drawn from life?

608
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,900
Well, that's one
of the good things about Paris...

609
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,800
lots of girls willing
to take their clothes off.

610
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,600
You liked this woman.

611
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:23,400
You used her several times.

612
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,100
Well, she had beautiful hands,
you see?

613
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,700
I think you must have had
a love affair with her.

614
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,900
No, no, no, no, no.
Just with her hands.

615
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,700
She was a one-legged prostitute.

616
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,200
See?

617
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,000
- (Aghast): Oh!
- (Both Chuckle)

618
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,400
Ah, she had a good sense
of humor, though.

619
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,600
Oh, and this lady...

620
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,900
she used to sit
at this bar every night

621
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,000
wearing every piece
of jewelry she owned

622
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,100
just waiting
for her long-lost love.

623
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,600
Called her Madame Bijou.

624
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,300
See how her clothes
are all moth-eaten?

625
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,400
Well, you have a gift, Jack.

626
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,700
You do. You see people.

627
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,900
I see you.

628
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,400
And?

629
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,300
You wouldn't have jumped.

630
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:31,300
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

631
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,500
Rose has already done that.

632
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,100
Look, here comes
that vulgar Brown woman.

633
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:40,000
Quickly, get up
before she sits with us.

634
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:43,000
Hello, girls. I was hoping
I'd catch you at tea.

635
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
We're awfully sorry
you missed it.

636
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,400
The countess and I were just off
to take the air on the boat deck.

637
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,500
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.

638
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,400
Molly:
Countess.

639
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,700
So you've not yet
lit the last four boilers?

640
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,400
No, I don't see the need.
We are making excellent time.

641
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,400
The press knows
the size of Titanic.

642
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,300
Now I want them to marvel
at her speed.

643
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,100
We must give them
something new to print.

644
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,700
This maiden voyage of Titanic
must make headlines.

645
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,100
Mr. Ismay, I would prefer
not to push the engines

646
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:26,400
until they've been
properly run in.

647
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,500
Of course
I'm just a passenger.

648
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,000
I leave it to your good offices
to decide what's best.

649
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:34,000
But what a glorious end
to your final crossing

650
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,300
if we were to get into New York
on Tuesday night and surprise them all.

651
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,500
Make the morning papers.
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

652
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,400
Good man.

653
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,000
Well, after that I worked on
a squid boat in Monterey.

654
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:54,000
Then I went down to Los Angeles
to the pier in Santa Monica

655
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:58,000
and started doing portraits there
for ten cents apiece.

656
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:02,200
Why can't I be like you, Jack...
just head out for the horizon

657
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:05,300
whenever I feel like it?

658
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:08,200
Say we'll go there
sometime to that pier

659
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,500
even if we only
ever just talk about it.

660
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,500
No, we'll do it.

661
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:17,000
We'll drink cheap beer. We'll ride
on the roller coaster till we throw up.

662
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:20,300
Then we'll ride horses on the beach
right in the surf.

663
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:24,500
But you'll have to do it like a real
cowboy. None of that sidesaddle stuff.

664
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,700
- You mean, one leg on each side?
- Yeah.

665
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:32,100
- Can you show me?
- Sure... if you like.

666
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:38,400
- Teach me to ride like a man.
- And chew tobacco like a man.

667
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,800
And spit like a man.

668
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,800
They didn't teach you that
in finishing school?

669
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,400
- No.
- Well, come on, I'll show you.

670
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,000
Let's do it.
I'll show you how. Come on.

671
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,600
Jack, no! Jack, no!

672
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,100
Wait, Jack. No, Jack.
I couldn't possibly, Jack.

673
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,600
Watch closely.

674
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,300
- That's disgusting!
- All right, your turn.

675
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,100
That was pitiful!

676
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,500
Come on, you really got
to hawk it back, you know?

677
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,700
Get some leverage to it.
Use your arms, arc your neck.

678
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,700
(Hawks)

679
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,700
- See the range on that thing?
- Mm-hmm.

680
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,100
- (Rose Hawking)
- Jack: Okay, go.

681
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,900
(Hawks)

682
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
- That was better. You got to work on it.
- Really?

683
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,500
Really try and hawk it up
and get some body to it, you know?

684
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,600
You got to...
(Snorting)

685
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,000
(Swallows)

686
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,700
Mother.

687
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,300
May I introduceJack Dawson?

688
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,200
Charmed, I'm sure.

689
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,200
The others were gracious
and curious

690
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,500
about the man
who had saved my life

691
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:57,600
but my mother looked at him
like an insect...

692
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:02,300
a dangerous insect
which must be squashed quickly.

693
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:07,000
Well, Jack, sounds like you're a good
man to have around in a sticky spot.

694
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,000
(Trumpet Playing Fanfare)

695
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:12,800
Why do they always insist on announcing
dinner like a damn cavalry charge?

696
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:16,900
- (Laughs)
- Shall we go to dress, Mother?

697
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,900
See you at dinner, Jack.

698
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,800
Uh, son? Son!

699
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,300
Do you have the slightest comprehension
what you're doing?

700
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,300
Not really.

701
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,400
Well, you're about to go
into the snake pit.

702
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,100
What are you planning to wear?

703
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,600
I figured. Come on.

704
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,700
I was right.

705
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,300
You and my son
are just about the same size.

706
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,300
Pretty close.

707
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,700
- (Whistles)
- You shine up like a new penny.

708
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,700
(Laughs)

709
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,000
Good evening, sir.

710
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:19,000
(Orchestra Playing
"On The Beautiful Blue Danube")

711
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,800
Good evening.

712
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,000
Man:
Hello.

713
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,200
Cal: Do you know that there are
several thousand tons

714
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,300
of Hockley steel
in this very ship?

715
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,000
- Ruth: Hmm. Which part?
- Cal: All the right ones, of course.

716
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,200
Then we'll know who to hold
accountable if there's a problem.

717
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,200
- Where's my daughter?
- Oh, she'll be along.

718
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,700
- There is the countess.
- Hello, my dear.

719
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,700
- Good evening, Cal.
- Cal: So good to see you.

720
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:57,900
I saw that in a nickelodeon once
and I always wanted to do it.

721
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,100
(Snickers)

722
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,200
Ruth:
I'll see you at dinner.

723
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:16,600
Darling? Surely
you remember Mr. Dawson.

724
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,000
Dawson?
(Chuckles)

725
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:23,800
Well, it's amazing.
You could almost pass for a gentleman.

726
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,700
- Almost.
- Extraordinary.

727
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,300
Ruth:
My dear, it's delightful to see you.

728
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,500
What a remarkable
voyage this is.

729
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,600
- It's mad, isn't it?
- Ruth: I love your perfume.

730
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,600
There's the Countess of Rothes.

731
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:55,800
And, um, that'sJohn Jacob Astor...
the richest man on the ship.

732
00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:00,300
His little wifey there, Madeleine,
is my age and in delicate condition.

733
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,000
See how she's
trying to hide it?

734
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,000
- Quite the scandal.
- Hmm.

735
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:09,800
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim
and his mistress Madame Aubert.

736
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,700
Mrs. Guggenheim is at home
with the children, of course.

737
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:15,700
And over here we have
Sir Cosmo and Lucille Lady Duff-Gordon.

738
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,400
She designs naughty lingerie,
among her many talents.

739
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,700
Very popular with the royals.

740
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,600
Congratulations, Hockley.
She's splendid.

741
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,500
Why, thank you.

742
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,600
- Care to escort a lady to dinner?
- Certainly.

743
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:33,100
- (Chuckling)
- Sweat pea?

744
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,900
- Cal: Sweet pea.
- Ain't nothin' to it, is there, Jack?

745
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,600
Remember, they love money, so just
pretend like you own a gold mine...

746
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,600
and you're in the club.

747
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:48,400
- Hey, Astor!
- Well, hello, Molly. Nice to see you.

748
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,300
J.J. Madeleine,
I'd like you to meetJack Dawson.

749
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,400
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.

750
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,500
Hello, Jack.
Are you of the Boston Dawsons?

751
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,200
No... the Chippewa Falls Dawsons,
actually.

752
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,900
Oh, yes. Yes.

753
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:08,400
He must have been nervous,
but he never faltered.

754
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,700
They assumed
he was one of them...

755
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,400
Heir to a railroad fortune,
perhaps.

756
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:19,500
New money, obviously,
but still a member of the club.

757
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,900
Mother, of course,
could always be counted upon.

758
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:26,000
Tell us of the accommodations
in steerage, Mr. Dawson.

759
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,400
I hear they're quite good
on this ship.

760
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:33,000
The best I've seen, ma'am.
Hardly any rats.

761
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,800
(Laughter)

762
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,800
Mr. Dawson is joining us
from the third class.

763
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:42,000
He was of some assistance
to my fiancee last night.

764
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,800
It turns out that Mr. Dawson
is quite a fine artist.

765
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,700
He was kind enough to show me
some of his work today.

766
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,800
Rose and I differ somewhat
in our definition of fine art.

767
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,900
Not to impugn your work, sir.

768
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:57,300
(Clears Throat)

769
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,500
Ismay:
She may be mine on paper

770
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,400
but in the eyes of God,
she belongs to Thomas Andrews.

771
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,400
(Whispering):
Are these all for me?

772
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,600
Just start from the outside
and work your way in.

773
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,900
He knows every rivet
in her, don't you, Thomas?

774
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,400
- Your ship is a wonder, truly.
- Thank you, Rose.

775
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:19,600
- And how do you take your caviar, sir?
- No caviar for me, thanks.

776
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:21,700
Never did like it much.

777
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:26,200
And where, exactly,
do you live, Mr. Dawson?

778
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,400
Well, right now, my address
is the R.M.S. Titanic.

779
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,900
After that,
I'm on God's good humor.

780
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:34,300
And how is it
you have means to travel?

781
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:36,500
I work my way
from place to place...

782
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,800
You know,
tramp steamers and such.

783
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:41,200
But I won my ticket
on Titanichere

784
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,400
at a lucky hand at poker.

785
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:46,500
A very lucky hand.

786
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,000
- All life is a game of luck.
- Mmm.

787
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,000
A real man makes
his own luck, Archie.

788
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,600
- Right, Dawson?
- Mmm.

789
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:58,500
And you find that sort of
rootless existence appealing, do you?

790
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:02,300
Well, yes, ma'am, I do.

791
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,100
I mean, got everything I need
right here with me.

792
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,100
Got air in my lungs
and a few blank sheets of paper.

793
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:13,000
I mean, I love waking up in the morning
not knowing what's going to happen

794
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:17,300
or who I'm going to meet,
where I'm going to wind up.

795
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:21,100
Just the other night, I was sleeping
under a bridge, and now here I am

796
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:24,300
on the grandest ship in the world
having champagne with you fine people.

797
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,000
- (Laughter)
- I'll take some more of that.

798
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,200
I figure life's a gift,
and I don't intend on wasting it.

799
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:34,500
You never know what hand
you're going to get dealt next.

800
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:38,300
You learn to take life
as it comes at you. Here you go, Cal.

801
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,200
To make each day count.

802
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,300
- Well said, Jack.
- Hear, hear!

803
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,900
To making it count.

804
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:51,600
- All: To making it count.
- Archie: Bravo.

805
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,500
(Molly Laughing)

806
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,200
Mr. Brown had no idea
I'd hidden the money in the stove.

807
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,200
(Laughter)

808
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:07,700
So he comes home drunk as a pig,
celebrating and he lights a fire.

809
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,600
(Laughter)

810
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,500
(Softly): Next it'll be
brandies in the smoking room.

811
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:17,700
Archie:
Well, join me in a brandy, gentlemen?

812
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,600
(Men Agree)

813
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:21,900
Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke
and congratulate each other

814
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
on being masters of the universe.

815
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,200
Ladies, thank you for
the pleasure of your company.

816
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:29,200
Rose, may I escort you
back to the cabin?

817
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,900
- No, I'll stay here.
- Here you go, Molly.

818
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,300
Archie:
Joining us, Dawson?

819
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,800
You don't want to stay out here
with the women, do you?

820
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:39,700
No, thanks.
I've got to be heading back.

821
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,700
- Ah.
- Probably best.

822
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:44,300
It'll be all business
and politics, that sort of thing...

823
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,700
Wouldn't interest you.

824
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,400
But Dawson, good of you to come.

825
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,300
Jack, must you go?

826
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,900
Time for me to go row
with the other slaves.

827
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,600
Good night, Rose.

828
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,600
(Clock Begins Chiming)

829
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,600
(Sighs)

830
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,800
So you want to go
to a real party?

831
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:51,500
- (Drums Pounding, Men Whooping)
- (Playing Lively Tune)

832
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:59,100
Is okay I put my hand here? Okay.

833
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,500
- Talla frikken svenska?
- What?

834
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,000
(Repeats Phrase)

835
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,200
I can't understand you.

836
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,800
(Glass Shatters)

837
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:48,000
Hey! Bravo, bravo!

838
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,900
- Thank you. Come on, guys.
- Let's go!

839
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:55,400
I'm going to dance
with her now, all right?

840
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,900
- Come on.
- What?

841
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,100
- Come with me.
- What? Jack... Jack, wait!

842
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,400
- (Band Playing At Fast Tempo)
- I can't do this.

843
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,600
We're going to have to
get a little bit closer.

844
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,000
Like this.

845
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:12,900
- (Pipes And Drums Playing Dance Tune)
- You're still my best girl, Cora.

846
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:18,200
- I don't know the steps.
- Neither do I.

847
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,400
Just go with it.
Don't think.

848
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,400
- (Laughing)
- Hey.

849
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,500
(Rose Squealing With Delight)

850
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:43,200
Wait, Jack, Jack!
Wait! Stop, Jack!

851
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:51,600
- Ba-ba-ba.
- (Dancers Whooping)

852
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,900
- Rose: Wait!
- Hey! Hey!

853
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,400
(Whooping)

854
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,400
- Jack: Yeah!
- Jack, no!

855
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,900
Whaaa!

856
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:42,900
(Squeals, Giggling)

857
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:46,900
...jurisdiction of the Sherman Act
so my lawyers will argue.

858
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,800
That's what Rockefeller said, but
the Supreme Court is not swallowing it.

859
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:55,300
(Men Shouting And Cheering,
Drums And Pipes Playing)

860
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:14,500
What? You think
a first-class girl can't drink?

861
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:17,900
- (Squeals)
- Get out of here.

862
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,100
- You all right?
- (Laughing)

863
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:23,500
- I'm fine.
- (Growls)

864
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,100
Two out of three,
two out of three.

865
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,500
So...

866
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,400
you think you're
big, tough men?

867
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,400
Let's see you do this.

868
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:38,300
Hold this for me, Jack.
Hold it up.

869
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,100
Ow!
(Laughing)

870
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,700
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
- You all right?

871
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,500
I haven't done that in years.

872
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,100
Go see Maggie, lads.
Give her the holley! Let's go!

873
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,100
Musicians:
Ho!

874
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,400
Coffee, sir?

875
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,100
I had hoped you would
come to me last night.

876
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,900
I was tired.

877
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:59,100
Your exertions below decks
were no doubt exhausting.

878
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,800
I see you had that undertaker
of a manservant follow me. How typical.

879
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:09,000
You will never behave like that
again, Rose. Do you understand?

880
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:16,000
I'm not a foreman in one
of your mills that you can command.

881
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:18,700
I'm your fiancee.

882
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,500
My fiancee?
My fiancee?!!

883
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,800
Yes, you are, and my wife!

884
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,700
My wife in practice if not yet by law,
so you will honor me.

885
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,000
You will honor me the way a wife
is required to honor a husband.

886
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:36,200
Because I will not be
made out a fool, Rose.

887
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,800
Is this in any way unclear?

888
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:42,500
- No.
- Good.

889
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,500
Excuse me.

890
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,400
Miss Rose!

891
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,900
- We had a little... accident.
- That's all right, Miss Rose.

892
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
- That's all right.
- I'm sorry, Trudy.

893
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,300
Let me help you.
It's all right, miss.

894
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,900
It's all right, miss.

895
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:16,300
- Tea, Trudy.
- Yes, ma'am.

896
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:36,700
You're not to see that boy again,
do you understand me?

897
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:41,000
- Rose, I forbid it.
- Oh, stop it, Mother.

898
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,400
You'll give yourself
a nosebleed.

899
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,400
This is not a game.

900
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:49,300
Our situation is precarious.
You know the money's gone.

901
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,000
Of course I know it's gone.

902
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,100
You remind me every day.

903
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:59,900
Your father left us nothing but a legacy
of bad debts hidden by a good name.

904
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,900
That name is the only card
we have to play.

905
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,300
I don't understand you.
It is a fine match with Hockley.

906
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:12,800
- It will ensure our survival.
- How can you put this on my shoulders?

907
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:17,200
- Why are you being so selfish?
- I'm being selfish?

908
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,700
Do you want to see me
working as a seamstress?

909
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,800
Is that what you want?

910
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:33,800
To see our fine things
sold at auction?

911
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:36,200
Our memories
scattered to the winds?

912
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,900
(Sighs)
It's so unfair.

913
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:53,300
Of course it's unfair.

914
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:55,300
We're women.

915
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,600
Our choices are never easy.

916
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,500

& O wind of heaven,
by Thy might &

922
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:50,900
& Save all who dare
the eagle's flight &

923
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:55,100
& And keep them
by Thy watchful... &

924
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,900
- Hello, Mr. Andrews.
- Hello, Jack.

925
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:12,000
- Sir.
- I need to talk to somebody for a sec.

926
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:14,500
You're not supposed
to be in here.

927
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:18,200
&... fire and foe
Protect them... &

928
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,100
I was just here last night.
You don't remember me?

929
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,700
No, I'm afraid I don't.
Now you're going to have to turn around.

930
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,200
He'll tell you.
I just... I just need...

931
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:28,600
Mr. Hockley
and Mrs. Dewitt Bukater

932
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:31,600
continue to be appreciative
of your assistance.

933
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:35,400
They asked me to, uh...
give you this in gratitude.

934
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:38,500
- I don't want your money. Please, l...
- And also to remind you...

935
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,700
that you hold
a third-class ticket

936
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:43,300
and that your presence here
is no longer appropriate.

937
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,300
Please, I just want
to speak to Rose for...

938
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:49,300
Gentlemen, will you please see that
Mr. Dawson gets to where he belongs

939
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,600
and that he stays there?

940
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,600
Yes, sir.
Come along, you.

941
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,500
& Oh, hear us
when we cry to Thee &

942
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:05,400
& For those in peril
on the sea. &

943
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,500
Ruth: And why do you have
two steering wheels?

944
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,500
We really only use
this near shore.

945
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,800
Excuse me, sir. Another ice warning.
This one's from the Noordam.

946
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:15,500
Thank you, Sparks.

947
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,300
Oh, not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.

948
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,400
In fact, we're speeding up.

949
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:25,300
I've just ordered
the last boilers lit.

950
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:32,100
Man: Okay, son,
wind it up tight like I showed you.

951
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,600
Okay, now, let it go.

952
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:39,500
- Was good, wasn't it?
- Quite nice.

953
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:42,100
That's excellent, son.

954
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,500
Rose:
Mr. Andrews, forgive me...

955
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,900
I did the sum in my head
and with the number of lifeboats

956
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,400
times the capacity you mentioned

957
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:59,100
forgive me, but it seems that there
are not enough for everyone aboard.

958
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:02,200
About half, actually.

959
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:06,900
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?
In fact, I put in these new type davits

960
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:09,800
which can take an extra row
of boats inside this one

961
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:14,200
but it was thought by some
that the deck would look too cluttered

962
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:17,300
so I was overruled.

963
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,600
Waste of deck space as it is
on an unsinkable ship.

964
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:25,300
Sleep soundly, young Rose. I have built
you a good ship, strong and true.

965
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,300
She's all the lifeboat you need.

966
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:30,800
Just keep heading aft.
The next stop will be the engine room.

967
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:33,100
Come on.

968
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:40,200
Jack, this is impossible.
I can't see you.

969
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:44,700
- I need to talk to you.
- No, Jack, no.

970
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,900
Jack, I'm engaged.

971
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:52,000
I'm marrying Cal.
I love Cal.

972
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:58,100
Rose, you're no picnic.

973
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:01,000
All right, you're a spoiled
little brat, even

974
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,800
but under that you're the most
amazingly astounding

975
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:10,000
wonderful girl... woman...
that I've ever known and...

976
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,600
- Jack, I...
- No, let me try and get this out.

977
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:16,400
You're, you're ama...

978
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,800
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.

979
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,800
I've got ten bucks
in my pocket.

980
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:24,700
I have nothing to offer you
and I know that.

981
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,400
I understand.

982
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:31,600
But I'm too involved now.
You jump, I jump, remember?

983
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:35,900
I can't turn away
without knowing you'll be all right.

984
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:38,500
That's all that I want.

985
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,000
Well, I'm fine.

986
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:44,200
I'll be fine, really.

987
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,700
Really?

988
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:52,800
I don't think so.
They've got you trapped, Rose

989
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,700
and you're going to die
if you don't break free...

990
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:58,300
Maybe not right away
because you're strong, but

991
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:02,000
sooner or later that fire
that I love about you, Rose...

992
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:04,800
that fire is going to burn out.

993
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,500
It's not up to you
to save me, Jack.

994
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:18,000
You're right.
Only you can do that.

995
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:27,300
I'm going back.
Leave me alone.

996
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:42,000
Countess: Tell Lucille about the
disaster you had with the stationer's.

997
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:45,200
Well, of course, the invitations
had to be sent back twice.

998
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:48,200
- Oh, my dear!
- And the dreadful bridesmaid's gowns...

999
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,600
Let me tell you what an odyssey
that has been.

1000
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:54,000
Rose decided
she wanted lavender.

1001
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:57,000
She knows I detest the color,
so she did it only to spite me.

1002
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,400
Lucille:
If only you'd come to me sooner.

1003
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:02,400
Ruth saw some of my designs
in "La Mode Illustree."

1004
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:05,900
They were for Trousseau of the Duchess
of Malborough's youngest daughter.

1005
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:09,300
They were quite charming, but I think
you'll agree, my dear, that together

1006
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,600
we've created something of a phoenix
from the ashes.

1007
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:13,600
(Women Laugh Politely)

1008
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:29,100
Hello, Jack.

1009
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,900
I changed my mind.

1010
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,100
- They said you might be...
- Shh.

1011
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:47,400
Give me your hand.

1012
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:57,500
Now close your eyes.

1013
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,500
Go on.

1014
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,100
Step up.

1015
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:09,100
Now hold on to the railing.

1016
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:12,200
- Keep your eyes closed, don't peek.
- I'm not.

1017
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:16,100
Step up onto the rail.

1018
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:23,000
Hold on. Hold on.
Keep your eyes closed.

1019
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:26,100
- (Giggles)
- Do you trust me?

1020
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,400
I trust you.

1021
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:40,900
All right, open your eyes.

1022
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:50,600
I'm flying! Jack!

1023
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,300
(Softly):
& Come, Josephine, my flying machine &

1024
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,200
& Going up, she goes &

1025
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:24,200
& Up, she goes... &

1026
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:14,100
That was the last time Titanic
ever saw daylight.

1027
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:18,300
So we're up to dusk
the night of the sinking.

1028
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,800
- Six hours to go.
- Incredible.

1029
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:23,500
There's Smith and he's standing there
and he's got the iceberg warning...

1030
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:28,000
in his fucking hand... excuse me...
his hand, and he's ordering more speed.

1031
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,900
26 years of experience
working against him.

1032
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,400
He figures anything big enough
to sink the ship

1033
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,700
they're going to see
in time to turn

1034
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,600
but the ship's too big
with too small a rudder.

1035
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:41,400
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1036
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:44,400
Everything he knows is wrong.

1037
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:58,700
(Laughing)
It's quite proper, I assure you.

1038
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,200
This is the sitting room.

1039
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:04,300
- Will this light do?
- What?

1040
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,600
Don't artists need good light?

1041
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:08,600
(In French Accent):
That is true

1042
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:11,500
but I'm not used to working
in such horrible conditions.

1043
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:14,300
Monet!

1044
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,500
- Do you know his work?
- Of course.

1045
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,700
Look at his use of color here.
Isn't he great?

1046
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,700
I know, it's extraordinary.

1047
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:28,000
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

1048
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,300
Should we be expecting him
anytime soon?

1049
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:35,300
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.

1050
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:41,700
- That's nice.
- What is it, a sapphire?

1051
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:45,500
A diamond,
a very rare diamond.

1052
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:54,500
Jack, I want you to draw me like one
of your French girls... wearing this.

1053
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,400
All right.

1054
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,700
Wearing onlythis.

1055
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:37,100
The last thing I need
is another picture of me

1056
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:40,000
looking like a porcelain doll.

1057
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,800
As a paying customer...

1058
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:49,800
I expect to get what I want.

1059
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:09,300
Over on the bed...
the couch.

1060
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:19,400
Go... lie down.

1061
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,700
- Tell me when it looks right.
- Put your arm back the way it was.

1062
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:28,700
Right.

1063
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:32,600
Put that other arm up,
that hand right by your face there.

1064
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:35,800
Right.

1065
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:38,400
Now, head down.

1066
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,600
Eyes to me,
keep them on me.

1067
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,700
And try to stay still.

1068
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:51,300
(Exhales)

1069
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,500
So serious.

1070
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:52,600
I believe you are blushing,
Mr. Big Artiste.

1071
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,500
I can't imagine
Monsieur Monet blushing.

1072
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:03,900
He does landscapes.
Just relax your face.

1073
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,600
- Sorry.
- No laughing.

1074
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:09,000
(Exhales)

1075
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,900
My heart was pounding
the whole time.

1076
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,000
It was the most erotic moment
of my life.

1077
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:51,300
Up until then, at least.

1078
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:56,900
- So what happened next?
- You mean, did we do it?

1079
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,600
Sorry, to disappoint you,
Mr. Bodine.

1080
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,500
Jack was very professional.

1081
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:14,900
Thank you.

1082
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,100
(Rose Laughing)

1083
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,400
What you doing?

1084
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,800
Will you put this back
in the safe for me?

1085
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:27,800
Mm-hmm.

1086
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:40,700
Would you excuse me?

1087
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:47,300
- None of the stewards have seen her.
- This is absurd.

1088
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:50,700
It's a ship, there's only
so many places she could be.

1089
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,700
Lovejoy, find her.

1090
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:12,700
- Clear.
- Yes.

1091
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:17,000
I don't think I've ever seen
such a flat calm.

1092
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:21,700
Like a mill pond.
Not a breath of wind.

1093
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:25,200
It will make the bergs
harder to see

1094
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:29,100
with no breaking water
at the base.

1095
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:31,100
Hmm.

1096
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:42,900
Well, I'm off. Maintain speed
and heading, Mr. Lightoller.

1097
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Yes, sir.

1098
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:58,200
It's getting cold.
You look nice.

1099
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,500
- (Knock At Door)
- Lovejoy: Miss Rose?

1100
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,500
My drawings!

1101
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:11,200
(Door Closes)

1102
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:30,600
Come on!

1103
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,300
- No, wait, wait!
- Wait, wait, wait!

1104
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,600
Go, go! Down, down!

1105
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:41,800
Rose:
Quickly, quickly!

1106
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,700
(Giggling)
Bye!

1107
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,700
- Sorry!
- (Giggling)

1108
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:04,900
- It's all right!
- (Laughing)

1109
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,500
Pretty tough for a valet,
this fellow.

1110
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,300
- Seems more like a cop.
- I think he was.

1111
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,700
- Jack: Oh, shit.
- (Rose Screams)

1112
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,500
No, over here!

1113
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,500
Quick!

1114
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,100
(Boiler Blasting)

1115
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,400
- Now what?!
- What?!

1116
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:48,000
Hold up! What're you two
doing down here?

1117
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,800
You shouldn't be down here!
It could be dangerous!

1118
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:58,300
Jack: Carry on! Don't mind us.
You're doing a great job!

1119
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,300
Keep up the good work!

1120
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:18,900
Ah, look what
we have here, huh?

1121
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:31,800
(Rose Clears Throat)

1122
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:38,700
Thank you.

1123
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:52,400
- (Honks Horn)
- Where to, miss?

1124
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:54,700
To the stars.

1125
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,500
You nervous?

1126
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,900
No.

1127
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:38,100
Put your hands on me, Jack.

1128
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:03,000
Crewman:
God, it's bloody cold.

1129
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:08,300
You know, I can smell ice,
you know, when it's near.

1130
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,900
- Bollocks.
- But I can, all right!

1131
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Murdoch: Did you ever find
those binoculars for the lookouts?

1132
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Haven't seen them
since Southampton.

1133
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,100
Well, I'll be on my rounds.
Cheerio.

1134
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:53,700
You're trembling.

1135
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:58,000
Don't worry.
I'll be all right.

1136
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:22,000
- They ran down there.
- Right.

1137
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:33,400
Lovejoy:
Anything missing?

1138
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:00,000
I've got a better idea.

1139
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:13,600
Gotcha!

1140
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:19,000
(Rose Laughing)

1141
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:23,000
(Laughing)

1142
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:26,200
Did you see those guys' faces?

1143
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:28,800
Did you see the...

1144
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:37,400
When the ship docks...

1145
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,400
I'm getting off with you.

1146
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:41,700
This is crazy.

1147
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:44,800
I know.
It doesn't make any sense.

1148
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,800
That's why I trust it.

1149
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:59,700
(Quietly):
Oh, yes. Here, look at this.

1150
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:02,600
Oh, look at that, would you?

1151
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:05,800
- They're a bit warmer than we are.
- Well, if that's what it takes

1152
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:09,500
for us to get warmer I'd rather not,
if it's all the same to you.

1153
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:24,400
- Bugger me!

(Phone Ringing)

1156
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:35,500
- Is there anyone there?
- Yes, what do you see?

1157
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:39,900
- Iceberg! Right ahead!
- Thank you.

1158
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:43,000
Iceberg! Right ahead!
Hard to starboard!

Full astern!

1163
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:04,400
- Hard over.
- Helm's hard over, sir.

1164

- Go, lads! Go!

Shut them!

(Dampers Slamming)

1168
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:27,000
Hold it.

1169
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,600
Hold it!

1170
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:31,600
Now, engage
the reversing engine!

Why aren't they turning?!

1174
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:06,100
- Is it hard over?!
- Crewman: It is, yes, sir, hard over!

1175
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:12,600
(Softly):
Come on, come on, come on.

1176
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:14,600
Turn.

1177
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:26,600
Yes.

1178
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:33,400
It's going to hit!

1179
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:47,300
Jesus Christ.

Get out the door!
They're closing the doors! Get out!

(Softly): Oh, my God.
That was a close shave, weren't it?

1196
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:44,500
Smell ice, can you?
Bleeding Christ.

1197
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:52,300
Note the time
and enter it in the log.

1198
01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:58,800
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

1199
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:03,000
An iceberg, sir.
I put her hard to starboard

1200
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:05,800
and ran the engines full astern
but it was too close.

1201
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:08,700
I tried to port round it
but she hit and the...

1202
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:12,400
- Close the watertight doors.
- Murdoch: The doors are closed, sir.

1203
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,300
- All stop.
- Crewman: Aye, sir!

(Ringing)

1205
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:26,600
Find the carpenter.
Get him to sound the ship.

1206
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:28,700
Yes, sir!

1207
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:34,000
Fabrizio:
Porca puttana!

1208
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:36,600
Che cazzo e?

1209
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,600
Come on, let's get the hell
out of here! Come on, hurry up.

1210
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:50,400
Excuse me. Why have the engines stopped?
I felt a shudder.

1211
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:53,100
I shouldn't worry, madam.
We've likely thrown a propeller blade.

1212
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:56,100
That's the shudder you felt.
May I bring you anything?

1213
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:58,200
No, thank you.

1214
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,200
Man:
Did you see anything?

1215
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:07,700
Man:
I don't see anything now, do you?

1216
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:09,700
(Commotion)

1217
01:44:09,700 --> 01:44:13,000
If this is the direction the rats
are going that's good enough for me.

1218
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:18,300
Crewman: Please, sir, please.
Everything's under control.

1219
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,800
- You there.
- Sir, there is no emergency.

1220
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:24,700
- Yes, there is, I have been robbed.
- Get the master-at-arms.

1221
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,500
- Now, you moron!
- Yes, sir.

(Men Laughing)

1223
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:35,000
Hey, you're going to miss the fun.
Did you see what happened?

1224
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:38,200
No, I missed it.
Apparently, it hit over there.

1225
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:40,900
Crewman: Boiler room six
is flooded eight feet above the plate.

1226
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,900
And the mail hold is worse. She's
all buckled in in the forward hold.

1227
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,300
- Can you shore up?
- Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1228
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:48,600
Have you seen the damage
in the mail hold?

1229
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:51,600
- No, she's already underwater.
- This is bad.

1230
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:55,600
We should tell
Mother and Cal.

1231
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:59,500
I think they're very good, sir.

1232
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:04,500
Don't touch anything.
I want the entire room photographed.

1233
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:07,000
Rose:
Just keep holding my hand.

1234
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:11,600
We've been looking
for you, miss.

1235
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:17,600
Rose (Sighs):
Well, here we go.

1236
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:26,400
Something serious has happened.

1237
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:28,400
Yes, it has.

1238
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:33,000
Indeed. Two things dear to me
have disappeared this evening.

1239
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,400
Now that one is back I have a pretty
good idea where to find the other.

1240
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:39,000
- Search him.
- Take your coat off, sir.

1241
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:41,000
- Now what?
- Come on.

1242
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:44,800
Cal, what are you doing? We're in the
middle of an emergency. What's going on?

1243
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:47,000
- Is this it?
- That's it.

1244
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:49,400
This is horseshit!

1245
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:53,200
- Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
- He couldn't have.

1246
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:55,900
Of course he could.
It's easy enough for a professional.

1247
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,700
But I was with him the whole time.
This is absurd.

1248
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:03,400
Perhaps he did it while you were putting
your clothes back on, dear.

1249
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:05,700
Real slick, Cal.
Rose, they put it in my pocket.

1250
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:08,800
- Shut up.
- It isn't even your pocket, is it, son?

1251
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:12,000
Property of A. L. Ryerson.

1252
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:17,200
- That was reported stolen today.
- I just borrowed it.

1253
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:20,900
- I was going to return it.
- We have an honest thief here, do we?

1254
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,200
You know I didn't do this, Rose.
You know it.

1255
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:27,200
Don't you believe them, Rose.
You know I didn't do it.

1256
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:29,500
- Come on, let's go.
- You know I didn't do it, Rose. Rose!

1257
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:32,000
Come on, son.
There's a good lad.

1258
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:35,500
- Come on.
- You know I didn't do it! You know me!

Ismay:
Most unfortunate, Captain.

1260
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:46,600
Water... 14 feet above
the keel in ten minutes...

1261
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:50,200
In the forepeak, in all three holds
and in the boiler room six.

1262
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:52,900
- That's right, sir.
- When can we get under way, damn it?

1263
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
That's five compartments.

1264
01:46:56,500 --> 01:47:00,200
She can stay afloat with the first
four compartments breached

1265
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:02,800
but not five... not five.

1266
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:05,500
As she goes down by the head
the water

1267
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:09,900
will spill over the tops of bulkheads
at E deck from one to the next.

1268
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,900
Back and back.
There's no stopping it.

1269
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:14,900
The pumps...
If we opened the doors...

1270
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:17,800
The pumps buy you time,
but minutes only.

1271
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:20,700
From this moment,
no matter what we do

1273

But this ship can't sink.

1274
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,000
She's made of iron, sir.
I assure you, she can...

1275
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:33,500
and she will.

1276
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:36,100
It is a mathematical certainty.

1277
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:41,300
How much time?

1278
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:51,300
An hour. Two at most.

1279
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:59,100
And how many aboard,
Mr. Murdoch?

1280
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:02,200
2,200 souls on board, sir.

1281
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:13,300
Well, I believe you may get
your headlines, Mr. Ismay.

1282
01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:34,500
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it? Will
you look at me when I'm talking to you.

- Not now, we're busy.

Sir, I've been told to ask you to please
put on your lifebelts and come up to...

01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:43,800
I said not now.

1287
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:47,000
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,
Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.

1288
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,600
Now, please, dress warmly.
It's quite cold out tonight.

1289
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:53,900
Now, may I suggest
topcoats and hats.

1290
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,100
- This is ridiculous.
- Not to worry, miss.

1291
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:00,200
I am sure
it's just a precaution.

- Just put your lifebelts on!

Sir?

1298
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:18,500
That's right... C. QD.
The distress call.

1299

That's our position.

that we're going down by the head.

where are the passengers?

01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:21,000
We moved them back inside.
It's too damn cold and noisy for them.

You got us all trussed up here
and now we're cooling our heels.

Sorry, ma'am.
Let me go and find out.

Go back and turn

Please tell me the truth.

01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:06,000
- (Screaming)
- Hold the left side! Right side only!

1380
01:55:06,100 --> 01:55:08,900
Right side only!
Right side only!

1381
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,500
Hold the left side!
Right side down!

1382
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:13,800
Lower away together!

1383
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:16,800
Steady, lads!

1384
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,100
(Explosion)

1385
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:25,200
(Passengers Gasp)

1386
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:08,200
You know, I do believe
this ship may sink.

1387
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:11,200
I've been asked to give you

1388
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:14,200
this small token
of our appreciation.

1389
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:19,500
Compliments of
Mr. Caledon Hockley.

1390
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:29,100
Come on, sister, you heard
the man... into the boat.

1391
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:31,300
Any room for a gentleman,
gentlemen?

1392
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:34,600
Crewman:
Only women at this time, sir.

1393
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:38,900
Will the lifeboats be seated
according to class?

1394
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:43,300
I hope they're
not too crowded.

1395
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:45,800
Oh, Mother, shut up!

1396
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:50,200
Don't you understand? The water is
freezing and there aren't enough boats.

1397
01:56:50,300 --> 01:56:55,300
Not enough by half. Half the people
on this ship are going to die.

1398
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:57,300
Not the better half.

1399
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:03,100
Come on, Ruth, get in the boat.
First-class seats are right up here.

1400
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:05,500
You know, it's a pity
I didn't keep that drawing.

1401
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:08,500
It'll be worth
a lot more by morning.

1402
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:14,600
You unimaginable bastard.

1403
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:19,100
Molly: Come on, Rose, darling.
There's plenty of room for you.

1404
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:21,400
Come on, Rose.
You're next, darling.

1405
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:23,400
Come into the boat, Rose.

1406
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:30,700
- Come.
- Rose, get into the boat.

1407
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:33,100
Rose.

1408
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:35,200
Good-bye, Mother.

1409
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,800
Rose! Rose, come back here!

1410
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:43,000
Where are you going?
To him?

1411
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,800
To be a whore to a gutter rat?

1412
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:48,600
I'd rather be his whore
than your wife.

1413
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:53,600
No. No!

1414
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:56,800
- I said no!
- (Hawking)

1415
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:58,900
Ruth:
Rose! Please stop!

1416
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:01,000
Crewman:
And lower away!

1417
01:58:01,100 --> 01:58:03,000
- Rose!
- Man the tiller!

1418
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:05,400
- No, wait!
- Lower away!

1419
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:07,800
- Rose!
- Lower together!

1420
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:15,100
Help!

1421
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:17,400
Can anybody hear me?

1422
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:20,400
(Banging Pipe)
Hello, help me!

1423
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:23,700
(Distantly):
Help me!

1424
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:26,400
Can anybody hear me?

1425
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:30,500
Somebody help me, please!

1426
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:32,800
Rose:
Mr. Andrews?

1427
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:38,200
- Steward, check the starboard corridor.
- Yes, Mr. Andrews.

1428
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:40,800
Madam, please put on a lifebelt.
Get to the boat deck immediately.

1429
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:43,000
Lucy, for God's sake,
put on your lifebelt.

1430
01:58:43,100 --> 01:58:45,300
- Set a good example.
- Yes, sir.

1431
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:48,800
- Anyone in here?
- Mr. Andrews? Mr. Andrews, thank God.

1432
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:51,100
Where would the master-at-arms
take someone under arrest?

1433
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:53,900
What? You have to get
to a boat right away.

1434
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:58,400
No! I'm doing this with or without your
help, sir, but without will take longer.

1435
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:04,900
Take the elevator to the bottom. Go
to the left down the crewman's passage.

1436
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:09,300
Then go right and left again at the
stairs. You'll come to a long corridor.

1437
01:59:14,100 --> 01:59:16,700
- This could be bad.
- (Water Gurgling)

1438
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:22,700
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

1439
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,400
(Struggling)

1440
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:30,700
- Excuse me, thank you.
- Crewman: The lifts are closed.

1441
01:59:30,700 --> 01:59:33,500
- Woman: I do not care...
- The lifts are...

1442
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:37,000
I'm sorry, miss,
but the lifts are closed.

1443
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:41,800
I'm through being polite, goddamn it!
Now take me down!

1444
01:59:41,900 --> 01:59:43,800
E deck.

1445
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:50,100
Come on. Oh, come on.

1446
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:54,600
(Yells)

1447
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:07,500
(Screams)

1448
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:10,300
- I'm going back up!
- No!

1449
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:12,600
No, no!

1450
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:17,600
Come back!
I'm going back up.

1451
02:00:17,700 --> 02:00:20,000
I'm going back up!

1452
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:30,500
Crew passage.

1453
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:32,700
Crew passage.

1454
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:45,800
(Breathing Hard)

1455
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:53,900
Jack?

1456
02:00:57,200 --> 02:00:59,000
Jack?

1457
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:05,100
Jack?!

1458
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:07,200
- Jack?
- Rose!

1459
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:09,400
Jack?!

1460
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:12,000
Rose, I'm in here!
I'm in here.

1461
02:01:12,100 --> 02:01:14,600
- Jack?!
- I'm in here.

1462
02:01:14,700 --> 02:01:16,600
- Jack?!
- Rose!

1463
02:01:16,700 --> 02:01:18,900
Jack! Jack! I'm sorry.

1464
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,300
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1465
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:26,100
- That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
- I know, I know, I know, I know.

1466
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:29,400
Listen, Rose, you're going to have
to find a spare key, all right?

1467
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:32,200
Look in that cabinet
right there.

1468
02:01:32,300 --> 02:01:34,800
It's a little
silver one, Rose.

1469
02:01:34,900 --> 02:01:36,800
Silver.

1470
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:40,900
- These are all brass ones!
- Check right here, Rose.

1471
02:01:44,900 --> 02:01:46,900
Rose...

1472
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,200
how did you find out
I didn't do it?

1473
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:51,200
I didn't.

1474
02:01:51,300 --> 02:01:54,300
I just realized I already knew.

1475
02:01:55,300 --> 02:01:57,900
- Keep looking.
- Oh.

1476
02:02:04,700 --> 02:02:08,200
No key. There's no key!

1477
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:11,800
All right, Rose, listen. You're going
to have to go find some help.

1478
02:02:11,900 --> 02:02:14,000
It'll be all right.

1479
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:20,300
I'll be right back.

1480
02:02:27,600 --> 02:02:30,100
I'lljust wait here.

1481
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:44,000
Hello, is there anyone here?

1482
02:02:45,200 --> 02:02:48,700
Hello? Is there anybody
down here?

1483
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
We need help! Hello!

1484
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:53,800
Damn it.

1485
02:03:00,100 --> 02:03:04,500
Can anybody hear me?
Please, hello! Hello!

1486
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:09,300
Oh, thank God.
Wait, please, I need your help.

1487
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:11,800
There's a man back here and...
Wait!

1488
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:18,500
Hello?

1489
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:32,200
(Loud Rumbling)

1490
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:35,500
(Rose Breathing Hard)

1491
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:46,700
- Hello?
- Ah, miss, you shouldn't be here now.

1492
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:49,400
- Please, I need your help.
- This way, quickly.

1493
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:52,500
There is a man down here
and he is trapped. Please.

1494
02:03:52,600 --> 02:03:54,700
- There's no need to panic.
- No, I'm not panicking.

1495
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:57,000
You're going the wrong way!

1496
02:03:57,100 --> 02:03:59,400
Let go of me, listen!

1497
02:04:04,100 --> 02:04:07,800
- To hell with you.
- Oh!

1498
02:04:07,900 --> 02:04:10,400
(Ship Creaking)

1499
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:45,200
(Softly):
Oh, my God...

(Loud Rumbling)

1503
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:36,700
- Jack!
- Rose!

1504
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:40,900
- Will this work?
- I guess we'll find out.

1505
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Come on.

1506
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,900
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Try a couple
of practice swings over there.

1507
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,600
All right.

1508
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:57,900
Good, now try to hit
the same mark again, Rose.

1509
02:05:57,900 --> 02:05:59,900
You can do it.

1510
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:07,000
Okay, that's enough practice.

1511
02:06:07,100 --> 02:06:10,100
Come on, Rose,
you can do it. Listen.

1512
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:13,000
Just hit it really hard
and really fast.

1513
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:17,700
Wait, open your hands up
a little more.

1514
02:06:17,800 --> 02:06:20,000
- Like that?
- Right.

1515
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,800
Listen, Rose, I trust you.

1516
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:29,100
Go!

1517
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:31,600
- (Clang)
- (Gasps)

1518

(Screaming And Laughing)

1519
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:37,800
You did it!
Come on, let's go.

1520
02:06:37,900 --> 02:06:40,500
Oh, shit, this is cold.
Oh, shit!

1521
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:42,300
Shit, shit.

1522
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:52,900
- This is the way out.
- We have to find another way. Come on.

1523
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,800
- Tiller: Pull.
- (Orchestra Playing)

1524
02:06:55,900 --> 02:06:59,800
Pull!
Put your backs into it, pull!

(Distant Shouting)

1526
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:05,700
Pull!

1527
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:08,700
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

1528
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:11,200
Pull!

1529
02:07:14,700 --> 02:07:17,100
(Distant Explosion)

02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:21,800
(Shouting)

1531
02:07:31,100 --> 02:07:33,400
Crewman:
What's this luggage doing here?

1532
02:07:33,500 --> 02:07:38,400
- Get rid of it, we need the room.
- (Crewman Giving Orders)

1533
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:40,400
(Crying)

1534
02:07:40,500 --> 02:07:42,400
Keep calm.

1535
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:44,600
No!

1536
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:52,200
- Lovejoy.
- She's not on the starboard side either.

1537
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:54,900
We're running out of time
and this strutting martinet

1538
02:07:54,900 --> 02:07:56,900
isn't letting
any men on at all.

1539
02:07:56,900 --> 02:07:59,500
There's one on the other side
letting men on.

1540
02:07:59,600 --> 02:08:04,300
Well, then, that's our play. We'll need
some insurance first. Come on.

1541
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:06,400
- (Pounding)
- This way.

1542
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:10,100
- All the way down here.
- (Jack Yelling)

1543
02:08:10,100 --> 02:08:14,400
Steward:
Here! What do you think you're doing?

1544
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:17,900
You'll have to pay for that, you know.
That's White Star Line property.

1545
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,900
Both:
Shut up!

1546
02:08:20,900 --> 02:08:25,100
Will you hold the boat a moment?
I just have to run back to my room...

1547
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:28,800
Sit down! She's the last.
All right to lower.

1548
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:31,900
Mr. Lightoller, why are the boats
being launched half full?

1549
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:35,100
- Not now, Mr. Andrews.
- There, look, 20 or so

1550
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:38,900
in a boat built for 65,
and I saw one boat with only 12... 12!

1551
02:08:38,900 --> 02:08:43,300
Well, we weren't sure of the weight,
Mr. Andrews. These boats may buckle.

1552
02:08:43,300 --> 02:08:47,700
Rubbish! They were tested in Belfast
with the weight of 70 men!

1553
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:51,300
Now, fill these boats,
Mr. Lightoller, for God's sake, man!

1554
02:08:57,400 --> 02:09:00,600
Please, I need more women
and children, please.

1555
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:07,600
Crewman: Get back in there.
This is not an exit.

1556
02:09:07,700 --> 02:09:10,300
Get back in there.
This is not an exit.

1557
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:16,200
You can't keep us locked in here like
animals. The ship's bloody sinking!

1558
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:19,800
Bring forward the women!
Unlock the gates.

1559
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:25,400
Women only! No men!

1560
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:29,600
(Shouting)

1561
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:33,800
Get back!

1562
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:37,800
Lock the gates!

1563
02:09:37,900 --> 02:09:40,800
Get them back
from those gates!

1564
02:09:40,900 --> 02:09:42,800
Don't touch the gates!

1565
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:49,000
For God's sake, man, there are
women and children down here!

1566
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,600
Let us up so we
can have a chance!

1567
02:09:51,700 --> 02:09:53,600
Get back!

1568
02:09:56,200 --> 02:09:58,200
- Jack!
- Tommy!

1569
02:09:58,300 --> 02:10:00,200
- Can we get out?
- It's hopeless that way!

1570
02:10:00,300 --> 02:10:03,100
Whatever we do,
we've got to do it fast.

1571
02:10:03,200 --> 02:10:05,100
- Jack!
- Fabrizio!

1572
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:08,500
- The boats are all gone.
- The whole place is flooding.

1573
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:11,300
- There is nientethis way.
- All right.

1574
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:14,100
Let's go this way,
all right? Come on.

1575
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:22,000
- I make my own luck.
- So do I.

1576
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:33,100
- Come on!
- No, come on. Let's go this way.

1577
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:39,400
- (Crying)
- (Speaking Arabic)

1578
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:44,100
- This way.
- Steward: Just go back

1579
02:10:44,200 --> 02:10:47,400
to the main stairwell
and everything will be sorted out there.

1580
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:49,400
Man:
Hell, it will.

1581
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:53,000
It will all get sorted out back there.
Go back to the main stairwell.

1582
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,300
- Open the gate.
- Go back down the main stair.

1583
02:10:55,300 --> 02:10:57,700
- Open the gate right now!
- Go back down the main stair...

1584
02:10:57,800 --> 02:11:00,700
like I told you.

1585
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:04,500
- Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!
- Stop that.

1586
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:07,900
Man:
Open the damn gate! Open it!

1587
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:11,800
Fabri, Tommy,
give me a hand here!

1588
02:11:11,900 --> 02:11:14,000
Rose:
Move aside. Move aside. Come on, pull!

1589
02:11:14,100 --> 02:11:16,600
Pull! Pull!

1590
02:11:16,600 --> 02:11:18,700
- Move aside!
- Steward: Put that down.

1591
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:21,900
- Move aside!
- One! Two!

1592
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
- Stop that!
- Three!

1593
02:11:24,100 --> 02:11:26,100
(Screaming)

1594
02:11:26,200 --> 02:11:29,100
Again!
(Screaming)

1595
02:11:29,200 --> 02:11:31,700
Jack:
Let's go!

1596
02:11:31,700 --> 02:11:34,600
- Jack: Let's go, Rose.
- You can't go up there.

1597
02:11:34,600 --> 02:11:36,700
You can't do this!

1598
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:47,600
Lightoller:
Keep order here. Back, back, back.

1599
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:50,600
(Screaming)

1600
02:11:51,800 --> 02:11:54,700
Hold on to her!

1601
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:59,200
Pull her in!
Get back I say

1602
02:11:59,300 --> 02:12:01,600
or I'll shoot you all like dogs.

1603
02:12:01,700 --> 02:12:04,200
Keep order here!

1604
02:12:04,300 --> 02:12:06,800
Keep order, I say.

1605
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:09,900
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

1606
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:16,300
Lowe:
Right, is everybody all right?

1607
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:18,400
Nobody panic.

1608
02:12:24,500 --> 02:12:27,800
- Crewman: Stay back!
- We're too late.

1609
02:12:27,900 --> 02:12:29,800
There are more boats
down the front.

1610
02:12:29,900 --> 02:12:32,900
Stay with this one... Murdoch.
He seems to be quite practical.

1611
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:34,900
(Women Screaming)

1612
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Lowe:
Sit down!

1613
02:12:50,100 --> 02:12:52,900
Stay back, you lot.
Stay back!

1614
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,300
Stay back, the lot of you!
Stay back!

1615
02:12:55,300 --> 02:12:58,900
- (Gunshots)
- It's starting to fall apart.

1616
02:12:58,900 --> 02:13:01,500
We don't have much time.

1617
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:04,600
- Mr. Murdoch?
- Mr. Hockley.

1618
02:13:04,600 --> 02:13:06,600
You two, with me, now.

1619
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:10,600
I'm a businessman, as you know and I
have a business proposition for you.

1620
02:13:10,700 --> 02:13:14,400
Crewman:
Easy now. All together.

1621
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:17,300
Lower away, lower away.

1622
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:19,300
Jack:
Come on, Rose.

1623
02:13:22,300 --> 02:13:24,300
The boats are gone!

1624
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:30,200
Colonel, are there
any boats on that side?

1625
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:33,400
No, miss, but there are a couple
of boats all the way forward.

1626
02:13:33,500 --> 02:13:35,800
This way, I'll lead you.

1627
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,800
(Playing Final Chord)

1628
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:44,600
What's the use?
Nobody's listening to us anyway.

1629
02:13:44,700 --> 02:13:47,600
Well, they don't listen to us
at dinner either.

1630
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:51,700
Come on, let's play. Keep us warm.
"Orpheus."

1631
02:13:51,800 --> 02:13:56,000
(Playing Fast Music From
"Orpheus In The Underworld")

1632
02:13:56,100 --> 02:13:59,100
Music to drown by.
Now I know I'm in first class.

1633
02:14:04,300 --> 02:14:07,700
- Where is everyone?
- They're all still aft, sir.

1634
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:12,900
We have an understanding then,
Mr. Murdoch?

1635
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:27,600
(Everyone Shouting)

1636
02:14:27,700 --> 02:14:30,500
(Gunshots)

1637
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:33,400
Women and children only!
Get back!

1638
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:37,800
Step back, sir. Come through, madam.
This way. Step back, sir.

1639
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:42,000
You'd better check
the other side. Go!

1640
02:14:44,100 --> 02:14:49,600
Crewman: Any more women and children?
Any children?

1641
02:14:49,700 --> 02:14:54,800
I found her on the other side
waiting for a boat... with him.

1642
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:58,500
- Any more women and children?
- They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.

1643
02:14:58,600 --> 02:15:01,800
Anyone else, then?

1644
02:15:01,900 --> 02:15:03,800
Anyone else? Hurry along.

1645
02:15:07,500 --> 02:15:09,500
Stand by the falls.

1646
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:12,600
(Softly):
Oh, goddamn it all to hell.

1647
02:15:14,500 --> 02:15:17,000
- Shit.
- Fire!

1648
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:20,300
Sir! Sir, you can't
go through here.

1649
02:15:20,300 --> 02:15:22,300
Sir, you can't go through.

1650
02:15:24,100 --> 02:15:26,100
Yes, yes, splendid.

1651
02:15:27,900 --> 02:15:30,000
Right.

1652
02:15:30,100 --> 02:15:32,900
Murdoch:
Prepare to lower!

1653
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:36,900
Ready on the left.

1654
02:15:41,900 --> 02:15:44,100
Take them down.

1655
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:50,500
Keep it steady.

1656
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:54,500
Both sides together, steady.

1657
02:15:54,500 --> 02:15:57,100
Keep it steady.

1658
02:15:57,300 --> 02:16:00,300
- Give her to me.
- Girl: Daddy.

1659
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:04,300
Man: It'll be fine, darling.
Don't you worry.

1660
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:07,400
It's good-bye for a little while.
Only for a little while.

1661
02:16:07,500 --> 02:16:10,200
There'll be another boat
for the daddies.

1662
02:16:10,300 --> 02:16:12,700
This boat's for the mummies
and the children.

1663
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:15,100
You hold Mummy's hand
and be a good little girl.

1664
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:18,100
- I'm not going without you.
- No, you have to go... now!

1665
02:16:18,100 --> 02:16:20,900
- No, Jack.
- Get in the boat, Rose!

1666
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:24,300
- No, Jack.
- Yes, get on the boat.

1667
02:16:24,300 --> 02:16:27,000
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.

1668
02:16:28,900 --> 02:16:32,300
My God, look at you.
You look a fright.

1669
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:34,300
Here.

1670
02:16:35,400 --> 02:16:38,200
Put this on. Come.

1671
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:46,800
- Go on, I'll get the next one.
- No, not without you.

1672
02:16:46,900 --> 02:16:48,900
Jack: I'll be all right.
Listen, I'll be fine.

1673
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,100
I'm a survivor, all right?
Don't worry about me.

1674
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:53,600
- Jack: Now go on, get on.
- I have an arrangement with an officer

1675
02:16:53,700 --> 02:16:55,700
on the other side
of the ship.

1676
02:16:55,800 --> 02:16:59,300
Jack and I can get off safely,
both of us.

1677
02:16:59,300 --> 02:17:02,000
See? Got my own boat to catch.

1678
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:05,100
Cal:
Now, hurry. They're almost full.

1679
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:09,900
- Step aboard, miss.
- Cal: Come on, hurry.

1680
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,300
- Step aboard, please.
- Man: Be Daddy's good girl.

1681
02:17:12,400 --> 02:17:15,500
- Step lively.
- Crewman: Keep back, keep back, I say.

1682
02:17:17,300 --> 02:17:20,000
Clear the row, please.

1683
02:17:20,100 --> 02:17:22,300
Lower away!

1684
02:17:22,300 --> 02:17:24,800
(Passengers Gasp)

1685

an old lady warm in her bed.

2005
02:50:50,800 --> 02:50:54,300
Not here. Not this night.

2006
02:50:54,300 --> 02:50:57,800
Not like this.
Do you understand me?

2007
02:51:00,300 --> 02:51:02,600
I can't feel my body.

2008
02:51:04,200 --> 02:51:08,300
Winning that ticket, Rose, was
the best thing that ever happened to me.

2009
02:51:09,700 --> 02:51:11,800
It brought me to you...

2010
02:51:13,600 --> 02:51:15,900
and I'm thankful for that, Rose.

2011

- I'm thankful.

2012

You must... You must...

2013
02:51:23,600 --> 02:51:26,100
You must do me this honor...

2014
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:32,800
You must promise me
that you'll survive

2015
02:51:32,900 --> 02:51:36,600
that you won't give up

Promise me now, Rose

2019
02:51:51,200 --> 02:51:54,100
and never let go
of that promise.

2020
02:51:54,200 --> 02:51:57,100
I promise.

2021
02:51:58,900 --> 02:52:00,800
Never let go.

2022
02:52:03,300 --> 02:52:05,500
I will never let go, Jack.

02:52:42,800 --> 02:52:45,300
No, sir.
None moving, sir.

2030
02:52:45,300 --> 02:52:47,500
Check them.

2031
02:52:47,600 --> 02:52:50,000
Bring that oar up here.

2032
02:52:54,300 --> 02:52:58,000
Check them, make sure.

2033

These are dead, sir.

2034
02:53:00,100 --> 02:53:03,600

keep looking!

when Titanicsank from under us.

2083
02:58:26,500 --> 02:58:30,800
There were 20 boats
floating nearby

and only one came back.

2085

One.

Six... out of 1,500.

Afterward, the 700 people
in the boats

2090
02:58:56,500 --> 02:58:59,200
had nothing to do but wait...

wait to die, wait to live...

2092

wait for an absolution
that would never come.

Oh, sir, I don't think you'll find
any of your people down here.

Isn't there another passenger list?

- There's no other list.
- Perhaps he's on another ship.

03:00:31,100 --> 03:00:35,600
- We're doing all we can, ma'am.
- There's got to be another list!

That's the last time
I ever saw him.

2101
03:00:59,300 --> 03:01:03,500
He married, of course,
and inherited his millions

2102
03:01:03,600 --> 03:01:07,400
but the crash of'29
hit his interests hard

03:01:07,500 --> 03:01:10,000
and he put a pistol
in his mouth that year

would there?

spoken of him until now.

a man named Jack Dawson

and that he saved me

in every way
that a person can be saved.

2118

I don't even have
a picture of him.
