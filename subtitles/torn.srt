Well, why are you here?

Walter just turned 16
last summer.

151

All he wanted was a car
for his birthday.

152
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,613
But my husband
wanted him to wait

to college.

154

Sweet kid.

158
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,803
I tried to give him space,

159
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:43,541
but I should have
picked him up the day...

160
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,653
And afterwards she told me

161
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:57,955
how her husband became
an evangelical,

162
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,491
and they couldn't do
the things they used to.

163
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,596
They couldn't even
put on masks

164
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,665
and go trick or treating.

165
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,368
We know all about
that kind of fanatic.

166
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,270
Mm-hmm.

167
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,976
Yammi?

168
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:21,679
Hmm?

169
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:23,981
We still have
each other, don't we?

170
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:38,596
Walter is... gone.

171
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,940
We could have another--

172
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,947
I can't do it.

173
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:39,510
Hello?

174
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:43,047
Oh. Oh, God. Again?

175
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,591
Hi.

176
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,627
Hi.

177
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,697
Do you know
what they want?

178
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,499
I have no idea.

179
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,767
Mrs. Pelletier,
Mrs. Munsif,

180
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,736
You both brought
recent pictures

181
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,938
of your sons, right?

182
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,708
If I could have them for
a moment, I'll make copies.

183
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,577
Can you tell us
what this is about?

184
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:16,146
I'll have them back to you
before you leave.

185
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:19,283
Mrs. Pelletier,
you can come in now.

186
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:20,918
I'll see you at 3:00.

187
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,620
I'll pick you up.

188
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:24,221
Oh, okay.

189
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:29,560
Ms. Pelletier,
I'm Special Agent Reese,

190
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:31,829
and you should know
some things have happened

191
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:33,797
to change the nature
of this case.

192
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,199
Case? What do you mean?

193
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,034
I didn't know
there was a case.

194
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,903
Remember I told you
about the firecrackers

195
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:40,905
in the backyard?

196
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:43,974
Well, one of them went off.

197
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,976
The ATF has found
evidence that there were

198
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:48,045
two explosions
at the food court that day.

199
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,914
The first one was a bomb,

200
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:52,783
which then set off
the gas main explosion.

201
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:55,719
What?

202
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,087
Your son was killed
by a bomb.

203
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:06,997
Oh, my God... A bomb.

204
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:09,800
We're sorry.
We're very sorry.

205
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,969
What happened?

206
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:15,673
Well, that's what we're
trying to figure out, okay?

207
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:19,677
Did your son, by any chance,
know this kid Walter?

208
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,178
Walter Munsif?

209
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,315
No.

210
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:26,150
Do you know
the Munsifs at all?

211
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:29,019
Well, I met her here
the other day.

212
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:31,188
Do you have any reason
to suspect that her son

213
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,223
could've had anything
to do with it?

214
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:35,225
The bombing?

215
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,132
My God!

216
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:44,301
You think Maryam's son
had something to do with it?

217
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,103
That is horseshit!

218
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,805
Well, how can you
be so sure

219
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:49,239
if you only met her
a few days ago?

220
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:50,975
I don't know.
I can just tell,

221
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:52,910
just like I can tell
you're an FBI bitch,

222
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:55,012
and you should not be calling me
with this kind of crap.

223
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:56,847
Okay, all right. Lea, we--

224
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,816
Mrs. Pelletier,

225
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:01,752
I've got a bomb
and a Pakistani kid,

226
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:03,887
so I'm sure
you can appreciate

227
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:06,023
where we're going
to have to go with this.

228
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,259
Can I go?

229
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,179
Don't tell them shit.

230
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,152
There were hundreds
of people there,

231
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,287
but you assume Walter
did it.

232
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:40,791
Mrs. Munsif, you were
born in Pakistan?

233
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:42,326
Yes,

234
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,328
but I'm an American citizen.

235
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,929
I've been here for 18 years.

236
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,332
And your husband, Ali.

237
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,801
He was born there, too?

238
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:53,270
Yes, he also is
an American citizen.

239
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,774
It says here that
your husband was brought in

240
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:59,410
for questioning
in December 2001,

241
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:01,378
in connection
with an investigation

242
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,980
into the Logan Street Mosque.

243
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:05,182
Does it also say there

244
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,851
that he was kept there
for 3 days,

245
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,787
and that he didn't
have a lawyer,

246
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,755
and that his family
had no idea

247
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:13,691
what was happening to him
and was terrified?

248
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,926
And then
you let him go,

249
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:18,095
a case of
mistaken identity.

250
00:28:18,097 --> 00:28:20,364
No apology, nothing.

251
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,202
Yeah, it does.

252
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,871
So, how did you feel
after all that?

253
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,940
How would you feel
if you were us?

254
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:32,176
We're American citizens.

255
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:35,045
We pay our taxes,
we follow all the rules,

256
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,047
and then you come and
take us away for no reason,

257
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,882
other than
we look different?

258
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,851
How would you feel?

259
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:42,953
I'd be angry.

260
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:45,322
I'd be furious,

261
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,825
and maybe if I'm young
and impressionable,

262
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:50,160
like any 16-year-old,

263
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:52,830
and I get mixed up
with the wrong people,

264
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:54,898
then maybe I'd want
to take some revenge.

265
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,434
We were not angry like that.

266
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,336
We were upset
like anyone would be

267
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:01,171
if they were treated
wrongly or unfairly.

268
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,507
Is that about it,
Agent Reese?

269
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:06,110
Yeah, that's it.

270
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:08,746
We'll call you when we need
to see you, Ms. Munsif.

271
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:10,314
<i>Kalkowitz: Thank you.</i>

272
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,125
<i>Maryam: They said</i>
<i>it was a bomb.</i>

273
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,964
What?

274
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:28,832
That killed Walter.

275
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:31,201
They're starting
an investigation.

276
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:34,171
<i>They mentioned</i>
<i>the Logan Street Mosque.</i>

277
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,173
It's starting again.

278
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:38,442
<i>Walter didn't do</i>
<i>anything wrong.</i>

279
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,277
We need to get a lawyer.

280
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,045
<i>Ali, let's just wait!</i>

281
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:43,514
They'll see Walter
is innocent.

282
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:50,854
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm just
going out with Lea.

283
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:53,457
I'll stop by the restaurant
after we're done.

284
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,826
Maryam, be careful
what you say to her.

285
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:57,227
<i>Why?</i>

286
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:59,163
Because you don't know her.

287
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:00,497
You don't know
what she could do.

288
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:01,965
Ali, she lost her son,
too.

289
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,574
So, tell me about the time
Walter was arrested

290
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,976
for fighting
at the movie theater.

291
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:55,045
Do you know why
he got into that fight?

292
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:56,680
No. Tell me.

293
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:58,682
Because the other boy
was saying

294
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:00,684
horrible things to him,
racist things.

295
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,953
Did Walter often
behave like that?

296
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:05,088
Impulsive? Hotheaded?

297
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:10,694
Walter was a quiet,
regular boy.

298
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:12,996
He loved reading history.

299
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:14,464
He loved playing
the guitar--

300
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,667
Oh, come on, Mrs. Munsif.
He broke that kid's jaw

301
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:18,535
at the fight
at the movie theater.

302
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,607
You made a terrible mistake
accusing my husband.

303
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,076
Don't do the same
with my son.

304
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,483
Was Walter involved
in any significant way

305
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,185
with the Logan Street
Mosque?

306
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:37,587
No.

307
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,957
Well, what if I told you

308
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:43,660
We have photos of him
entering the Mosque

309
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,462
on at least two occasions?

310
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,301
Maybe there was some kind of
celebration or something, but--

311
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,370
So, Walter wasn't involved

312
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:55,305
with any radical groups,
jihadists,

313
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:58,442
people with anti-American
or anti-Western ideologies?

314
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:00,310
No. Walter loved this country.

315
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,512
We love this country.

316
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:05,115
Which is why I'm sure you're
going to be totally cooperative

317
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:07,117
with us.

318
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,179
What happened, Maryam?

319
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,150
They have pictures
of Walter

320
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:42,119
outside Logan Street
Mosque.

321
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,057
Was he going
to the mosque?

322
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,695
What would he
go there for?

323
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,099
I don't know.

324
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:58,235
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

325
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,406
What are we going to do?

326
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:07,778
I think we should move back.

327
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,713
Back?

328
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,085
It's only going to get worse.

329
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:18,121
And leave everything
we've built and crawl back?

330
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:22,159
I talked to Yusuf's Uncle.

331
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:24,194
His cousin Tazim
is going to buy my share

332
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:25,495
of the restaurant.
I think it's a good idea.

333
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:27,364
This is not happening, Ali.

334
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:28,632
We're not going back there.

335
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:30,367
You're talking
about our homeland,

336
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:33,336
where our families
come from.

337
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:34,738
Sure, we have our madmen.

338
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,339
Sure, we have
20 million people

339
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:37,741
shitting in the streets,

340
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,409
but at least we're not
circling the world

341
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,378
dropping bombs
at everything we don't like!

342
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,580
What do we have here that's
so goddamn precious anyway, huh?

343
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,085
Give me a mud hut
on a dusty street.

344
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:50,220
Give me biryani
on a filthy plate

345
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:52,255
in the middle of a stinking
market, with an open sewer

346
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,458
running through it.
At least we'd have our son!

347
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,333
I didn't mean it.

348
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:05,402
You did.

349
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,740
<i>( door slamming )</i>

350
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,748
( reporters shouting )

351
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,517
Man: Mrs. Munsif,
Mrs. Munsif!

352
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,319
Woman: We just need
a little bit of your time.

353
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:24,287
How do you feel
the police

354
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,223
are handling
this investigation?

355
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:28,191
Mrs. Munsif!

356
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:29,726
Was your son involved
in the blast?

357
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:31,528
Was your son involved
in the blast, Mrs. Munsif?

358
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:50,313
Hi, Janet? This is Maryam.

359
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,149
Yeah, I just wanted
to let you know

360
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:54,718
that we've got
some great new listings.

361
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,820
Yeah, and the condo
we looked at last week,

362
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:59,489
the one you really liked...

363
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,359
Yeah, well, they've just
dropped their asking price.

364
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:04,294
So, um...

365
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,831
Oh. Okay, okay...

366
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,935
Yeah, I do understand,
but, you know,

367
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:13,703
it's a good time to buy.

368
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,743
Okay. Yeah, okay.

369
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:22,245
Just call me
when you're ready.

370
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:23,914
Yeah. You, too.

371
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,387
( humming )

372
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:37,360
Sorry I haven't come by.

373
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,296
I wasn't sure.

374
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:41,198
I thought you might
want to be alone.

375
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,666
Yeah, that's okay.

376
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:45,535
I feel so bad. I just
don't know what to say.

377
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,672
There's nothing to say.

378
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:50,607
I mean, who could do
such a thing?

379
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,610
What could have possibly
been going through

380
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:56,279
that Muslim kid's head?

381
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:57,447
They don't really know
what happened.

382
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,482
Come on.
You saw the article.

383
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:01,618
Angry Muslim kid,

384
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,687
always fighting
with American kids.

385
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:06,856
Father was a suspect
during 9/11.

386
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,678
What the hell
are you doing here?

387
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,780
Did my husband let you in?
Why are you in my house?

388
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:33,383
Excuse me, ma'am. You can't
go in there right now.

389
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:35,285
Don't tell me what
I can do! This is my--

390
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:36,519
Sorry, ma'am. We have
a search warrant.

391
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:39,322
Mrs. Munsif, please
wait downstairs.

392
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:41,424
You have no right
to be here.

393
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,627
Don't make this any harder
than it has to be.

394
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:45,495
Harder than it has to be?

395
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:48,298
That's my son's room!

396
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,899
We're done checking
the bedroom, ma'am.

397
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:51,901
Anything?
A couple of transmitters.

398
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:54,638
These are my son's toys.

399
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,640
They're ordinary toys!

400
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:58,441
Here's a copy
of the search warrant.

401
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,609
<i>Our suspect,</i>
<i>a Pakistani-American juvenile,</i>

402
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:08,778
<i>claimed he was being harassed</i>
<i>with racial insults</i>

403
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,613
<i>by group of teenagers.</i>

404
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:12,816
<i>An altercation ensued,</i>

405
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:15,719
<i>and the suspect broke the jaw</i>
<i>of a 14-year-old boy.</i>

406
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,019
Where are you going?

407
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,788
( tires screeching )

408
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,929
Oh, my God.
Call the police.

409
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:05,402
What for? They think
we are terrorists, too.

410
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:06,636
So we do nothing?

411
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:08,905
Wake up, Maryam.

412
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,630
We're going to do
some pass-bys during the day,

413
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,666
keep our eye on things,
all right?

414
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:11,701
Now, I've lived around here
for a long time.

415
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:14,871
I know most of these people
around here are good people,

416
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:16,539
but, you know, we don't
blame you 'cause you've got

417
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:18,775
some you-know-whats
in your country,

418
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:20,877
so we hope you don't blame us
because we've got our share.

419
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:23,046
Let me tell you something.

420
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:25,515
About a million years ago,
I get out of the Academy.

421
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:27,984
I've got to go on a patrol
with this guy Terry Sikorsky.

422
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,753
He's an old school cop.
He's a veteran,

423
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:33,556
30 years on the job,
Ukrainian.

424
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:35,825
We're down in the Tenderloin,
and he busts this guy Winston.

425
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,794
Winston's got a kilo of shit
in his shirt.

426
00:41:37,796 --> 00:41:40,897
Shit?

427
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:43,099
You know, heroin, dope.

428
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:45,602
Sikorsky busted him
twice before. He cuffs him.

429
00:41:45,604 --> 00:41:49,239
Winston turns to Sikorsky
and says, "The harm is done."

430
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:51,741
I don't get it.

431
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:53,676
We're back at the station,
and I ask Sikorsky,

432
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,678
"What do you mean
'the harm is done'?"

433
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,680
Sikorsky looks at me,
and he says,

434
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,816
"It's what people do to people.

435
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:02,685
What does it matter
who did it? The harm is done."

436
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,158
So, if I'm you,
I'd stay put and fight.

437
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,205
Tim!

438
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:23,873
Hey, Tim!

439
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,675
Hang on a second.

440
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:26,709
What the hell
is going on?

441
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,244
What?

442
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:30,013
You gave half my shift
to Juanita.

443
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,614
The woman can barely
speak English.

444
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:34,317
I'm not getting any
complaints about Juanita.

445
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,786
You're getting
complaints about me?

446
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:39,756
Yeah. Lots.

447
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:41,291
Okay, okay. Listen.

448
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:42,926
I've got to have
these shifts.

449
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:44,561
You took away Wednesday
and Thursday,

450
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:45,929
and I've got
to have these shifts,

451
00:42:45,931 --> 00:42:47,163
or I'm not going
to be able to make it.

452
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:48,765
Come on, man.
Help me out.

453
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:50,600
Look, I know you're going
through some tough times--

454
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:52,802
Tough times. Tough times.

455
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:54,304
That's what you call it,
tough times? You have no idea

456
00:42:54,306 --> 00:42:56,105
what the hell
you're talking about.

457
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:58,007
Lea--
Do you know what
I've been dealing with?

458
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:01,044
Lea, calm down.
Look, this is serious.

459
00:43:01,046 --> 00:43:03,613
If your work doesn't improve,
I'm going to have to let you go.

460
00:43:03,615 --> 00:43:05,648
You can consider this
your official warning.

461
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,218
This is bullshit!

462
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:56,132
From the guy down there.

463
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:44,714
( sobbing )

464
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:05,902
I can't talk
about this anymore.

465
00:45:05,904 --> 00:45:08,705
We lost our son.

466
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:10,440
Somebody threw a brick
through our window.

467
00:45:10,442 --> 00:45:12,308
You're losing
your clients.

468
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:15,144
People will realize
that Walter didn't do it.

469
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:16,913
And you're sure that's
what they're going to find?

470
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:17,980
Aren't you?

471
00:45:17,982 --> 00:45:20,083
My son was not a murderer,

472
00:45:20,085 --> 00:45:22,218
but what does that matter?
Things are changing.

473
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,020
People are desperate.
They'll believe anything now!

474
00:45:24,022 --> 00:45:26,122
This is our home, Ali.

475
00:45:26,124 --> 00:45:27,890
We have to defend it.

476
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,492
That is fine for the cops
because they have guns,

477
00:45:29,494 --> 00:45:31,294
and they can protect
themselves.

478
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:33,062
We are foreigners here
and always will be.

479
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:34,464
They see a gun
in the hand of a Muslim,

480
00:45:34,466 --> 00:45:37,100
and he's a terrorist.

481
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:39,469
Kalkowitz can't know
what that feels like.

482
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:42,138
His son died in Iraq.

483
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,073
That's what I'm saying,
right there.

484
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:47,043
His son died in Iraq.

485
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:48,878
What does that tell you?

486
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,292
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

487
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,095
Ali and I had a terrible night.

488
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,968
You lied to me.

489
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,237
What?

490
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:17,039
What are you talking about?

491
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:19,842
I never lied to you.

492
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:21,477
Have you been drinking?

493
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:23,246
Why, you want to drink?

494
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:25,248
No, you don't do that,

495
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,283
but your son hanging out
with terrorists,

496
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:30,219
beating up white kids,
that's okay.

497
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:33,456
Why didn't you tell me
that Walter had been arrested?

498
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:35,491
Why didn't you tell me that?

499
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:39,796
What you read or heard
in the news

500
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:42,098
is just not true.

501
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,067
Walter is innocent.

502
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:47,470
I trusted you!

503
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,919
I told you my secrets.

504
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:06,556
I told you about my Eddie,
and all along you knew.

505
00:47:06,558 --> 00:47:09,025
Stop it! Stop it!
You knew!

506
00:47:09,027 --> 00:47:11,060
You of all people

507
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:13,496
should understand
what I'm going through.

508
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,568
And I thought
you were my friend.

509
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,442
Your friend.

510
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,548
How?

511
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,350
How can I be your friend?

512
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:43,492
Your son killed Eddie.

513
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,276
That's what I thought.

514
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:27,270
So a week ago,
this is all bullshit,

515
00:48:27,272 --> 00:48:29,272
and now this kid
is a suicide bomber?

516
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:32,975
You asked me if I had reason
to suspect him, and now I do.

517
00:48:32,977 --> 00:48:34,377
Are you aware of the fact
that your kid

518
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:36,112
was being bullied at school?

519
00:48:36,114 --> 00:48:38,014
Eddie was being bullied?

520
00:48:38,016 --> 00:48:39,548
Yeah. We were going
to call you.

521
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,517
Yeah? Where are you
getting this from?

522
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,386
Well, we've got witnesses.

523
00:48:43,388 --> 00:48:45,288
He was standing at
a bus stop on Sullivan,

524
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,356
behind the school.
This bunch of kids

525
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:49,292
comes up to him,
starts picking on him,

526
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:51,327
pushing him around. One
of them grabs his knapsack,

527
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:53,329
throws it out
into the street,

528
00:48:53,331 --> 00:48:55,631
and Eddie says,
"This is the last time

529
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:57,967
you assholes are going
to do this to me,"

530
00:48:57,969 --> 00:49:00,036
and one of the kids
stops laughing

531
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:01,971
long enough to say to him,
"Yeah, Eddie. What are you

532
00:49:01,973 --> 00:49:03,272
going to do about it?"
and you know what Eddie says?

533
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,308
No, what?

534
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,343
He said, "Because I'm going
to kill you. All of you."

535
00:49:07,345 --> 00:49:11,213
Bullshit. You're making it up.

536
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:13,149
That's bullshit?

537
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:14,951
Yes, it's bullshit!
Don't you think I would know

538
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:16,953
if my son was being bullied?
He would have told me!

539
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:18,988
Do you know a kid
named Andrew Hull?

540
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,289
No.
Do you know a kid
named Richie Palmer?

541
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,724
No.
Bobby Mason?

542
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:23,292
What, are these the boys
that you say were fucking

543
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,593
with my kid?
Yeah!

544
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:26,429
Then I want to talk to them.

545
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:28,297
You can't talk to them, Lea,
because two of them are dead,

546
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,599
and one of them is in a coma!

547
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:35,104
That's a hell of a coincidence,
don't you think?

548
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:37,707
Huh? You going to
meet me halfway here?

549
00:49:37,709 --> 00:49:40,042
Well, Eddie had nothing
to do with it.

550
00:49:40,044 --> 00:49:41,377
Look, I'm going to get
to the bottom of this,

551
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:43,646
with or without your help.

552
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:47,616
( knocking )

553
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:52,355
Hi.

554
00:49:52,357 --> 00:49:54,156
Hi. I'm glad you called.

555
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:56,192
Yeah. Come on in.

556
00:49:58,128 --> 00:49:59,729
Just sit down.

557
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:01,230
Okay.

558
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:02,698
Do you want something
to drink?

559
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,069
What are you going
to have?

560
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:08,771
Beer.

561
00:50:08,773 --> 00:50:10,673
Beer sounds good.

562
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,341
I've mellowed with age.

563
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:14,110
Huh.

564
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:21,250
Thank you.

565
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,731
So?

566
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:37,433
The police suspect Eddie.

567
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:39,301
What?

568
00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:41,370
They're saying
that he threatened

569
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,672
to kill some kids, and then
three of those kids

570
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:45,474
died in the explosion.

571
00:50:45,476 --> 00:50:47,176
There's no way that Eddie

572
00:50:47,178 --> 00:50:49,578
had anything to do
with this bombing.

573
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:53,516
I just wanted to tell you
that, you know, I--

574
00:50:53,518 --> 00:50:56,719
I tried. I tried to be
a good mom.

575
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,821
I wanted Eddie
to be a good person,

576
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:01,424
just like you did.

577
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:03,726
I tried to love him...

578
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,264
Take good care of him.

579
00:51:08,266 --> 00:51:11,333
Lea, I know. I know.

580
00:51:11,335 --> 00:51:14,503
Don't beat yourself up.

581
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:16,839
Do you remember when, um--

582
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:18,374
When he was a baby,

583
00:51:18,376 --> 00:51:20,443
just starting to crawl?

584
00:51:20,445 --> 00:51:23,479
We were living with
your folks in Redding,

585
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:26,482
and somehow he got outside
into the backyard,

586
00:51:26,484 --> 00:51:29,618
and he started eating
all those daffodils?

587
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,121
One after another, he must have
eaten about 20 of them?

588
00:51:32,123 --> 00:51:34,290
Yeah, and you were convinced
he was going to die.

589
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:38,327
Yeah, I remember.

590
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:40,529
I didn't know what to do,

591
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:44,133
and you were just so calm.

592
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:46,602
You just picked him up

593
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:48,838
and drove us straight
to the emergency room.

594
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,439
Remember that?

595
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:53,442
Yeah. Yeah, I remember.

596
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,444
A lot of good it did.

597
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:57,513
They didn't do anything,
told us not to worry.

598
00:51:57,515 --> 00:52:00,783
Remember, you almost took
that nurse's head off.

599
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:03,319
Well, she was a bitch.

600
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:06,188
( chuckling )

601
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:08,190
Oh, Lea.

602
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,430
Don't be so tough, Lea.

603
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:18,367
Let me in.

604
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:23,305
Let me help you.

605
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:26,775
Just a little bit.

606
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:31,380
Okay?

607
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:16,225
I thought his room
would be messier.

608
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:18,394
No, I cleaned it.

609
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:20,396
I mean, he always had...

610
00:53:20,398 --> 00:53:22,364
piles of clothes
everywhere.

611
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:26,468
He was a good kid.

612
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:29,939
He had strange taste
in music, though.

613
00:53:29,941 --> 00:53:32,508
I think he got that
from you.

614
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:35,411
Probably.
You want some juice?

615
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:40,216
We should think about suing
the police for harassment.

616
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,520
There is no way our son
was involved in that bomb.

617
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:47,256
You've got some poor,
angry Muslim kid

618
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:49,325
who was probably raised
by uneducated fanatics

619
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:51,860
who taught him he could
bomb his way into heaven.

620
00:53:51,862 --> 00:53:53,862
I mean, what is it, 70--

621
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:55,864
77 virgins? Some shit.

622
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:57,533
Don't.

623
00:53:57,535 --> 00:53:59,001
What?

624
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,639
Oh, God. I'm supposed to be PC

625
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:05,841
about people who don't
belong here in the first place?

626
00:54:05,843 --> 00:54:09,345
No way. They get
what they deserve.

627
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,982
Did Eddie get what he deserved?

628
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:22,625
You know what I meant.

629
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:27,396
Yeah.

630
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,567
I know what you meant.

631
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:35,037
You know, I have
a really busy day today.

632
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:39,408
Yeah.

633
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:42,378
Yeah. Okay.

634
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,813
Okay.

635
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,651
Ms. Pelletier.

636
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:28,691
Eleanor. Eleanor.

637
00:55:28,693 --> 00:55:32,394
Was there a woman
asking about me?

638
00:55:32,396 --> 00:55:34,463
Oh, yes.

639
00:55:34,465 --> 00:55:35,698
What did she want?

640
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,533
What do you think?

641
00:55:37,535 --> 00:55:39,468
I don't know.
What did she want?

642
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,442
You can keep it.

643
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,426
Kalkowitz here?

644
00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:05,994
I tried calling, but
I just got his voicemail.

645
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:07,596
He's in the field today.

646
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:25,748
How does it feel now?

647
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,383
How do you like
everyone accusing you?

648
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:28,584
He didn't do it.

649
00:56:28,586 --> 00:56:29,785
That's not
what the papers say.

650
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:31,420
Come on!
You were right.

651
00:56:31,422 --> 00:56:34,490
Maryam--
No.

652
00:56:34,492 --> 00:56:36,558
We can't be friends.

653
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:42,431
Your son is a murderer.

654
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:50,639
( rock music playing )

655
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:00,449
Hey, it's wild mommy,
from that video.

656
00:57:00,451 --> 00:57:02,818
( laughing )

657
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,053
Gordian Knot time, baby.

658
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:13,562
<i>Hi, I'm Eddie.</i>

659
00:57:13,564 --> 00:57:16,565
<i>So, my dad's, like,</i>
<i>this religious nut,</i>

660
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:18,901
<i>but I haven't seen him</i>
<i>for, like, 10 years</i>

661
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:22,638
<i>'cause he's too busy</i>
<i>praying, or something.</i>

662
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,606
<i>Mom's pretty cool, though.</i>

663
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:27,876
She takes me to concerts a lot.

664
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:30,546
<i>Pretty wild mommy, huh?</i>

665
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,085
<i>You know,</i>
<i>to tell you the truth,</i>

666
00:57:37,087 --> 00:57:39,455
<i>I don't really give a shit.</i>

667
00:57:39,457 --> 00:57:41,690
<i>They got the game</i>
<i>stacked out there.</i>

668
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:43,158
<i>You have to fit</i>
<i>into their little molds</i>

669
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,993
<i>and their</i>
<i>little fucking cliques,</i>

670
00:57:44,995 --> 00:57:46,862
<i>and if you're</i>
<i>anything different,</i>

671
00:57:46,864 --> 00:57:48,964
<i>you're some fucking freak</i>
<i>that they can push around</i>

672
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:51,099
<i>whenever they feel like it</i>
<i>'cause you're nothing to them.</i>

673
00:57:51,101 --> 00:57:53,101
<i>You're just a thing to them.</i>

674
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:54,870
<i>You've got to be Quiet Wyatt.</i>

675
00:57:54,872 --> 00:57:56,672
You just sit there and take it,

676
00:57:56,674 --> 00:57:59,508
while they take all the credit,

677
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:02,177
but it's Gordian Knot time now.

678
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,682
<i>Yeah.</i>

679
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,260
Yes, hello.

680
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:20,796
Um, I would like
to send flowers

681
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:23,799
to a patient, and I need
the room number, please?

682
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:25,901
Uh, Robert Mason?

683
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:31,840
Here you go.

684
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,909
Thanks.

685
00:58:33,911 --> 00:58:36,278
Thanks for coming over,
Nausheen.

686
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,580
I'm sorry I couldn't
return your calls.

687
00:58:38,582 --> 00:58:40,148
I meant to.
It's just that--

688
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:43,852
How are you holding up?

689
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:48,056
Oh God, I miss Walter
so much.

690
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,761
We barely even spoke
the last few months.

691
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,598
We were always so busy.

692
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,200
I hardly saw him.

693
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:01,937
I know what you mean.

694
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:04,973
I used to see him and Jawad
all the time,

695
00:59:04,975 --> 00:59:08,110
but I hadn't seen him
in ages.

696
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:10,946
He ate dinner at your place
the night before the bombing.

697
00:59:10,948 --> 00:59:12,814
No, he didn't.

698
00:59:12,816 --> 00:59:14,983
Yes, he did.

699
00:59:14,985 --> 00:59:16,885
No. I'm positive.

700
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:19,221
I would've remembered.

701
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:32,100
I need to talk to you
about something.

702
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,139
When was the last time
you met Walter?

703
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:39,741
I don't know.
About two months ago.

704
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,679
So, he wasn't supposed
to have dinner with you

705
00:59:43,681 --> 00:59:45,614
the night before
the bombing?

706
00:59:45,616 --> 00:59:47,616
No. We really just weren't
hanging out that much,

707
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:48,884
you know, for a while.

708
00:59:48,886 --> 00:59:50,586
Since when?

709
00:59:50,588 --> 00:59:52,120
Maybe the last
half a year or so.

710
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:53,922
Ever since then,
Walter was different.

711
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,824
How so?

712
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:58,126
Well, he was pissed off.

713
00:59:58,128 --> 01:00:01,129
He didn't talk about it much,
but he was really mad.

714
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:03,599
Like the fight he had
at the theater?

715
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:05,000
Yeah.

716
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:10,005
So if you guys weren't
hanging out, where was he?

717
01:00:10,007 --> 01:00:12,007
I don't know. By himself.

718
01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:13,875
At the mosque.

719
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:16,378
He even asked me
to come a few times.

720
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,913
At the Logan Street Mosque?

721
01:00:17,915 --> 01:00:19,381
Yeah.

722
01:00:19,383 --> 01:00:20,849
Did you go with him?

723
01:00:20,851 --> 01:00:22,851
Yeah, once or twice.

724
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:42,904
<i>PA announcer: Dr. Hunton,</i>
<i>4814. Dr. Hunton, 4814.</i>

725
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:50,679
Aren't you Eddie's mom?

726
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,784
Yeah.
You knew Eddie?

727
01:00:55,786 --> 01:00:58,720
Yeah. We went
to school together.

728
01:00:58,722 --> 01:01:01,657
I'm Robbie's brother.

729
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:04,893
Oh.

730
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:07,663
Oh. How is he doing?

731
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:10,932
Not good.
Why are you here?

732
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:15,404
Oh, I don't know.

733
01:01:15,406 --> 01:01:18,040
I mean, it's insane,

734
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:19,675
but they think Eddie
might have had

735
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:22,978
something to do
with the bombing.

736
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,980
Yeah, I know.

737
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:28,950
The police think your brother
was bullying him.

738
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:31,319
Yeah? My brother's
in a coma now.

739
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:36,091
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I didn't, I didn't mean to--

740
01:01:36,093 --> 01:01:37,993
( banging )

741
01:01:37,995 --> 01:01:39,695
What's wrong?

742
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:00,115
Hey.

743
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:04,986
Is he going to be
okay?

744
01:02:04,988 --> 01:02:07,923
No. This whole thing
is just so fucked up.

745
01:02:07,925 --> 01:02:09,858
I know.

746
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:14,129
I mean,
we were just joking.

747
01:02:14,131 --> 01:02:15,964
What do you mean?

748
01:02:15,966 --> 01:02:17,365
The cops were right.

749
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:20,268
Robbie, the guys,

750
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:23,105
we were all just
jacking up Eddie.

751
01:02:23,107 --> 01:02:25,006
Why would you do that
to Eddie?

752
01:02:25,008 --> 01:02:26,908
He's a freak!

753
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,111
Do you think he did it?
You think he did it?

754
01:02:29,113 --> 01:02:30,879
We were at the bus stop,

755
01:02:30,881 --> 01:02:32,447
and he says he's
going to kill all of us.

756
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:36,151
Just because he said it
doesn't mean he did it.

757
01:02:36,153 --> 01:02:38,086
Just because he said things--

758
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:40,021
People say things all the time.
It doesn't mean he did it.

759
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:42,057
It wasn't
what he said.

760
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:43,759
His eyes were dead.

761
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:46,361
And the bombing?

762
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:49,765
The bombing
was five days later.

763
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,273
( chanting )

764
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,194
My son Walter--

765
01:03:19,196 --> 01:03:21,229
<i>As-salaamu alaykum.</i>

766
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:23,098
<i>Wa alaykum as-salam.</i>

767
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,167
I was at Walter's
funeral, Mrs. Munsif.

768
01:03:25,169 --> 01:03:26,868
How are you
getting along?

769
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:29,371
Was my son coming here
before he died?

770
01:03:29,373 --> 01:03:32,574
Yes, he was.
Wonderful young man.

771
01:03:32,576 --> 01:03:34,910
For how long?

772
01:03:34,912 --> 01:03:37,579
I don't know exactly,
but for some time.

773
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:39,347
More so recently.

774
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:42,150
What was he doing here that
he couldn't tell me about?

775
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:44,352
Nothing.

776
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:46,955
He was praying,
learning about Islam.

777
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:50,926
What kind of Islam?

778
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:55,163
Mrs. Munsif,
Islam is a religion

779
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:57,566
of peace and charity,
huh?

780
01:03:57,568 --> 01:04:00,101
We are not extremists
or jihadis here.

781
01:04:00,103 --> 01:04:02,103
We are Americans.

782
01:04:02,105 --> 01:04:03,839
We would never teach
anything

783
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:05,207
that would be violent
or harmful to this country.

784
01:04:05,209 --> 01:04:07,342
Why was he lying to me?

785
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:09,211
Why didn't he tell me
he was coming here?

786
01:04:09,213 --> 01:04:11,146
I have no idea,
Mrs. Munsif.

787
01:04:11,148 --> 01:04:12,948
Go ask your husband.

788
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,855
My husband knew that
Walter was coming here?

789
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:21,456
Yes.

790
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:23,358
He came with him
a number of times.

791
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:27,963
Excuse me.

792
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:03,531
<i>When were you</i>
<i>going to tell me?</i>

793
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:05,600
Tell you what?

794
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:07,969
<i>About Walter.</i>

795
01:05:07,971 --> 01:05:10,105
What about Walter?

796
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,075
About Walter
going to the mosque.

797
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:17,979
Stop lying to me, Ali.
I know.

798
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:20,348
I just spoke to the Imam.

799
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,250
Why didn't you tell me?

800
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:25,654
I would have,

801
01:05:25,656 --> 01:05:27,555
but he made me promise
not to tell you.

802
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:29,024
Why?

803
01:05:29,026 --> 01:05:31,026
Because he knew
how you'd react,

804
01:05:31,028 --> 01:05:34,095
that you'd get angry
and try to stop him.

805
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:36,097
He was lost, Maryam.

806
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:37,666
I could see it.

807
01:05:37,668 --> 01:05:39,501
He was angry.
He wasn't hanging out

808
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:41,303
with Jawad and
his friends anymore.

809
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:44,506
He needed something, Maryam.

810
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:54,015
What should I have done?

811
01:05:54,017 --> 01:05:57,118
I don't know, but
you should have told me.

812
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:02,123
How can I ever
trust you again, Ali?

813
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:13,168
What? What is it?

814
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:15,603
What happened, Ali?

815
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:23,078
Well, at first
he studied with the Imam.

816
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:28,350
He's a good man.

817
01:06:28,352 --> 01:06:30,151
But then he met...

818
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:34,723
Some of the more radical
people at the mosque.

819
01:06:34,725 --> 01:06:37,158
Why didn't you do something?

820
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,260
Why didn't you stop him?

821
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:41,329
I tried, Maryam. I tried!

822
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:43,164
But the more
I told him to stay away,

823
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:44,733
the more he wanted
to be with them.

824
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:57,078
Do you think he did it?

825
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:02,684
He was a good kid, Maryam.

826
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:05,153
Do you think Walter did it?

827
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:17,265
I don't know.

828
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:23,204
I don't know.

829
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:40,355
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Hank Kalkowitz.

830
01:07:40,357 --> 01:07:43,525
I'm head of the Alameda County
task force on terrorism.

831
01:07:43,527 --> 01:07:47,295
As you know, this past month
we have been investigating

832
01:07:47,297 --> 01:07:50,298
every aspect of the Newmont
shopping mall bombing,

833
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:53,301
where the two suspects we had
died in the explosion,

834
01:07:53,303 --> 01:07:55,837
and the one eyewitness
was in a coma.

835
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:58,239
He was in a coma, that is,

836
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:00,108
up until this morning,
when he died.

837
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,509
( crowd gasping )

838
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:03,511
<i>Man: Are you saying</i>
<i>you have no more leads?</i>

839
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:05,346
No, sir. That's not
what I'm saying.

840
01:08:05,348 --> 01:08:07,515
I am not saying that at all.
We are going to follow up

841
01:08:07,517 --> 01:08:09,717
on every lead we get,
but what I am saying is,

842
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:12,554
at this juncture,
I need to tell you

843
01:08:12,556 --> 01:08:16,124
that this investigation
is going from active to ongoing.

844
01:08:16,126 --> 01:08:18,159
But you know
one of those kids did it!

845
01:08:18,161 --> 01:08:19,794
Aren't you going to do
anything about it?

846
01:08:19,796 --> 01:08:22,363
Don't you owe us
that much?

847
01:08:22,365 --> 01:08:24,132
Well, from my perspective, sir,

848
01:08:24,134 --> 01:08:26,234
what we owe the community
is the truth,

849
01:08:26,236 --> 01:08:28,503
and right now you're going
to have to bear with us

850
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:30,805
because we don't know
what that truth is.

851
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:32,307
Thank you.

852
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:37,312
I'd just like to assure everyone
we are not closing this case.

853
01:08:37,314 --> 01:08:40,548
It is ongoing. What we'd like
to do with the rest of this time

854
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:43,151
is to answer any questions
that you might have.

855
01:08:43,153 --> 01:08:44,752
