00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,512
You're just
having a bad dream.
That's all, baby.

3
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,354
That's all it was.

4
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:03,385
Bad dreams make
you think you've seen
things that you haven't.

5
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:08,257
You know what I do
when I have a bad dream?

6
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,735
I close my eyes
and I think of
something nice.

7
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,205
Like being
here with you.

8
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,596
Hurry up, sweetheart.
We're going to be late.

Shit.

12
00:02:58,445 --> 00:02:59,810
Jack?

13
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,046
Did you see someone
ring my doorbell?

14
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,674
No.

15
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,718
Okay, thanks.

16
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,316
I cleaned everything
away, sweetheart.

17
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,155
Everything is exactly
the way it was before.

18
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,856
They're clean
and shiny. Look.
Look. You see?

00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,159
{cries}

20
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,723
Okay, all right.
Just close your eyes.

21
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,704
Well, hello, sailor.

22
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,898
Hi!

23
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,406
Permission to
come aboard?

24
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,966
Honey, hold this.

25
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,774
So sorry we couldn't make
it yesterday. Somebody
was working late again.

26
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,278
How're you doing, Sal?

27
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,875
I'm good.
How are you?

28
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,387
I'm all right.

29
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,718
Look at you.

30
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,758
Do you like it?

31
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,224
You look great.

32
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,227
Really? I just
kind of threw it on.

33
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,263
She's had outfits
laid out for a week.

34
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,924
You're such a liar.
You know my husband.

35
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
I don't listen
to what he says.
You know that.

36
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,302
I brought my really
good friend, Heather.
She's so nice.

37
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,999
Promise me
you'll be attentive.

38
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,410
How're you doing, man?

39
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,242
She's not
to bring anyone.

40
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:18,511
You don't like her?
Believe me, she's the best
looking of Sally's friends.

41
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,678
Which it doesn't
say much.

42
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,813
I asked you not to.

43
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:27,620
You're living on a boat
with an 18-year old boy
and you're saying no girls.

44
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,792
Greg, this is Heather.

45
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:34,799
She's a very good friend
of mine, and I just thought
you guys should meet.

46
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,336
Hi.

47
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,664
Can you just excuse me
for a moment?

48
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,941
Jess. You okay?

49
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,777
I don't think so.

50
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,614
Hey. What happened?

51
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:58,621
Hey. What's the matter?

52
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,852
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,155
You've got nothing
to apologize for.

54
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,992
What is it?
Are you okay?

55
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,032
I'm just tired.

56
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:09,363
Well, listen, we don't
have to go today if
you don't want to.

57
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,461
No, we do.
I-I want to go.

58
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,200
You sure?

59
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,702
Yeah.

60
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,912
Yeah.

61
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,848
Yeah? Okay, come on.
Come up here.

62
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,880
This is Sally and
her husband, Downey.

63
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,722
This is Heather,
Sally's friend.
You remember Victor.

64
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,695
So let's go sailing!

65
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,061
Okay.

66
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,756
{Heather}
Hey.

67
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,490
You okay?

68
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,630
Is Greg okay?

69
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,600
He's fine.
He's upstairs.

70
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,864
You've been asleep
for a couple of hours.

71
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,269
I had this terrible dream.

72
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,705
What about?

73
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,935
I don't remember.

74
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,706
I wouldn't worry.

75
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:36,043
Apparently bad dreams
cure you of real
life stress.

76
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:40,142
As indeed
does champagne.
You want some?

77
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,188
Yeah.

78
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,215
Downey, want to give me
a hand, please?

79
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:50,456
Actually, Victor, I'm
a guest of the Captain's,
but yes, I will help you.

80
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,624
Victor, what was that
back there at the harbor?

81
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,133
What?

82
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,999
I asked Jess if
she was all right
and you said no.

83
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,562
You told me she was
bringing the little
boy along.

84
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:04,473
When I was walking
with her in the harbor
I asked where he was.

85
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,569
She couldn't remember.

86
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,738
She stared into space
for like 20 seconds

87
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,873
and then she said
he's at school.

88
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,043
So?

89
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:16,179
Well, it's Saturday.
Isn’t no school today.

90
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:20,022
Her son goes to a special
needs school and it's
open every day.

91
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,386
Be nice to her.

92
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,761
All right.

93
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,096
Do you boys
sunbathe together?

94
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,830
Sometimes.

95
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:36,342
The champagne is not
great but it is cold.
Want some?

96
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,376
No thanks.

97
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,344
Okay, more for me.

98
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,676
Hey, how are you feeling?

99
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,842
I'm sorry, I didn't
realize how tired I was.

100
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,376
You apologize one more
time, and I'm going to
throw you overboard.

101
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,858
Here.

102
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,188
You all right?

103
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,921
Yeah.

104
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,933
He thinks we're
a fishing boat.

105
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,309
He's going to go hungry.

106
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,207
You want to steer?

107
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,751
Nah.

108
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,447
Go on.

109
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,559
Which way
do I am?

110
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,618
You're going to
aim that way.

111
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,959
It's easy, right?

112
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,067
So, she's a waitress
at some diner.

113
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,733
At least there
they talk. They
became friends.

114
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,901
Oh, and she has
an autistic son.

115
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,274
So they're just friends.

116
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,937
Sally!

117
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,743
What do you want me
to say? I'm sorry she
has a retarded son?

118
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,477
Yeah!

119
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,951
Well, I'm sorry.
You know, that's not
Greg's problem, that's hers.

120
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,852
What is it,
is it the shorts?

121
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,925
No! Heather, Greg's
been my friend for
a really long time.

122
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,518
I can't just sit back
and watch him get
shaken down.

123
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,119
She isn't doing that.

124
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,758
Well, I hope not
because Greg is
far too trusting.

125
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,802
I'm kind of
linking the boy.

126
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,100
Uh, no, you're not.
Can you please go up
there and talk to Greg?

127
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,142
I really think
the two of you will
be perfect for each other.

128
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:19,508
And I really don't like
seeing him with her.

129
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,841
Jess, are you ready?

130
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,008
Yeah, let her go.

131
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,618
Yeah.

132
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,190
Woo!

133
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,996
{Jess}
So, how do you
know everyone?

134
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,058
Victor, he's staying
with me for good.

135
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,296
He got in trouble
at home. He had
to get away.

136
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,839
I found him sleeping
behind the store
at the harbor.

137
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,968
You know, we got talking,
and now he lives here.

138
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,876
Just like that
you let him move in?

139
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,847
Well, I got three rooms.
I can't sleep in them all.

140
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,646
And Downey,
I've known him
since I was a kid.

141
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,483
Sally, his wife,
I know her from
high school.

142
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,080
I dated her
for like four days
in the eighth grade,

143
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,592
so technically
she's my ex.

144
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,356
They seem really nice.

145
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:14,491
Yeah. Except for the fact
that every year they
feel obliged

146
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,934
to bring me
an eligible girl.

147
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,232
Maybe they think
you're lonely.

148
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,331
Do I give off
lonely to you?

149
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,103
Sometimes.

150
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,907
When I come to see you
at the diner, I'm not
lonely, I'm hungry.

151
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,243
Obviously yesterday
was different.

152
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,717
What happened yesterday?

153
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,516
Yesterday I was
not hungry.

154
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,353
I came in with the sole
purpose of inviting
you sailing.

155
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,791
You did?

156
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,589
I did.

157
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,861
Turn at port side.
We're losing wind.

158
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,928
Let me check it
for just a sec.

159
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,045
So, things are
okay with Tommy?

160
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,048
The same.

161
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,879
Every day is the same.

162
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,749
Tommy likes the things
to be a certain way. Yeah.

163
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,483
If I do one thing
differently, I lose him.

164
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:17,222
What's the matter?
I've never seen you
like this before.

165
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:21,324
I don't know. I just, uh,
I just feel guilty when
I'm not with Tommy.

166
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,299
That's because
you're a good mother.

167
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:27,339
But you can't
be everywhere
all of the times.

168
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,965
Hey, guys. Oh!
{laughs}

169
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,067
How is it going?

170
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,113
We're good.

171
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,015
I was just wondering
if I could steal Jess
away from you.

172
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,177
Sally's dying
to talk to her.

173
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,085
We're kind of in the middle
of something right now.

174
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,182
No, no, it's okay.
I-I should circulate.

175
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,525
Hey, just for the record,

176
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:55,795
I'm not interested.

177
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,110
You, what the fuck?

178
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,651
Wind's dropped down on us.

179
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,217
It's not dropped,
it's gone.

180
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,164
{Victor}
This is crazy.

181
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,169
You ever seen
this before?

182
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,695
Yeah, yeah. Just not
quite so sudden.

183
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,033
Are we okay to get
home? There is no wind.

184
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,635
Yeah, yeah. We got
an engine. It's not
a problem.

185
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,205
It's just, it's weird.

186
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,182
Greg?

187
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,082
Is that normal?

188
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,828
{thundering}

189
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,443
{Downey}
Okay, I'm fucking
freaked, what the fuck.

190
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,295
Triangle to coast
guard. Over.

191
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,895
{radio interference}

192
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,464
Triangle to coast
guard. Over.

193
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:44,907
{interference}

194
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,968
Coast guard,
go ahead. Over.

195
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:51,573
We've just gone from seven
knots to absolute zero. You've
got anything unusual? Over?

196
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,449
Nothing showing up. Over.

197
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:59,457
It's darkening up pretty
quick out here. Looks like
an electrical storm. Over.

198
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,926
{distressed woman}
Help me. Please.
Can you hear me?

199
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,657
Help me.
Please, help me.

200
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:09,758
Killing everyone. They're
dead. They're all dead.

201
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:13,237
We hear you.
What's your
position? Over.

202
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,570
{interference}

203
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,304
Distressed caller,
we hear you. What are
your coordinates? Over.

204
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,243
{interference}

205
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:25,181
Coast guard, did you hear
a distress call? We're not
getting it anymore. Over.

206
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:30,119
Distressed caller,
make another transmission.
What is your position?

207
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,282
{Heather}
Greg?

208
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,656
{rumbling}

209
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,939
Get below deck now.
Get the life jackets.

210
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,239
Cut it.
Cut the sail.

211
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,973
Vic, get the main
sail down.

212
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,016
Get it down.

213
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,246
{shouting}

214
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,855
Vic!

215
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,687
No!

216
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,731
{shouts}

217
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,334
Get back.

218
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,875
{Jess shouts}

219
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:59,571
Jess, take my hand.

220
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,010
Grab on.

221
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,446
Heather!

222
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,752
Grab on.

223
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,598
Heather!

224
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,771
Vic!

225
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,734
Jess.

226
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,470
Are you okay?

227
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,136
All right.

228
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,975
{Downey coughs}

229
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,275
Downey?

230
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,509
Are you guys okay?

231
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,145
Have you seen Heather?
She got lost through
the window.

232
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,484
No. Come on, come on.

233
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,650
Heather!

234
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,497
Heather!

235
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,961
Greg! Help me!

236
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,334
{Greg}
Sally. Sally.

237
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,770
Just give me
your hand.

238
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,831
Heather!

239
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,732
Are you guys okay?

240
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,204
Yeah.

241
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,377
Are you all right?

242
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,680
Tommy's at school, yeah?

243
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:27,893
He'll be looked after
until we get back.
He'll be all right.

244
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,100
{squawking}

245
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,893
Thank God. You!
Help us!

246
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:16,738
{all at a time}
Help us. Help.
Help us. Over here.

247
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:19,566
Oh, God.

248
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,704
Hey. Hey.

249
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:25,615
{all at a time}
Wait. Come on,
over here!

250
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:28,414
There, there. Over there.
I can see someone.

251
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,479
{Victor}
You, we need some
help down here.

252
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,458
{Sally}
Help us, please!

253
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,291
Hello. We need
some help down here.

254
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,059
Yeah, he's seen us.
He's seen us.

255
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,827
{Greg}
Oh, thank God.

256
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,806
Jump, jump, jump.

257
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:59,775
Okay. Jess,
come on, come on.

258
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,252
Jess. Come on.

259
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,448
Come on, come on,
take my hand. Okay.

260
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:07,651
Okay. You okay?

261
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:27,205
{Downey}
You okay? Yeah?

262
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,210
Hey.

263
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:34,513
How is it?

264
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,181
See? I told you.

265
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,522
Hello?

266
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,509
Hello?

267
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,401
Hello!

268
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,915
Do we wait?

269
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,577
No, let's go
to the bridge.

270
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,485
We'll get the captain
to put a call out to
the coast guard.

271
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,218
We'll get a search
for Heather.

272
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,425
Come on.

273
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,898
Do you think Heather
would've made it
on board?

274
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,027
Honey.

275
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:26,765
There's a chance,
isn't there?

276
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,773
{Downey}
Yeah. Yeah,
there's a chance.

277
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,096
Hello?

278
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:02,237
Hello?

279
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,285
Hello!

280
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,925
{Sally}
Somebody please help us?

281
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:28,461
Hello?

282
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,745
{Victor}
Where the fuck
is everybody?

283
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:47,308
{Downey}
You don't even now
where we're going.

284
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,855
Well, we're just,
just walking for
the sake of it.

285
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,303
You all right?

286
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:09,500
I feel like
I know this place.

287
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,971
I recognize
this corridor.

288
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:18,779
Liners, they look
pretty similar.

289
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,285
No, that's not it.

290
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,844
{Victor}
Come check this out.

291
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:26,720
This is the same ship.
This thing's old.

292
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,292
Jess.

293
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,856
Come on.
Come on.

294
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:35,661
1932. It's the same.
Here's where we boarded.

295
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,794
Oh, yeah.

296
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:43,706
Aeolus.

297
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:47,301
Aeolus was the Greek
god of the winds and
the father of Sisyphus,

298
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:50,644
the man condemned by the gods
to the task of pushing a rock
up a mountain

299
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,650
and let it see
roll back down again.

300
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,686
That's a shitty
punishment. What
did he do?

301
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,586
He cheated Death.
No, he made a promise
to Death that he didn't keep.

302
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,990
I studied it but I can't
remember. Can we just
keep on moving, please?

303
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,257
{clank}

304
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,496
Hello?

305
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:34,523
Whoever it was
might want to come
back for these.

306
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,424
Let me see?

307
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:42,026
These are mine.

308
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,398
These are my keys.

309
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:44,902
What are you
talking about?

310
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,959
They're mine.

311
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,402
Bullshit.

312
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:49,566
This is, this is
my house key.

313
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:53,702
This is my, my car key.
This is my son. See?

314
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,974
Wait. So you had them
with you on the yacht?

315
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,140
Yes.

316
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,410
It's got to be Heather.

317
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:00,543
Come on.

318
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,416
How else did
they get here?

319
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:06,320
It was Heather dropping
her keys but not bothering
to say, "I didn't drown."

320
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:07,619
Why not?

321
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,290
{Greg}
Come on.

322
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,001
{Sally}
Heather?

323
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,851
Looks like you get your
welcome party, just
not the welcome.

324
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,485
Heather!

325
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,587
You, Greg, what
time you got?

326
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,997
Eleven thirty.

327
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:51,001
Heather.

328
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,702
Heather!

329
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,104
Where is everyone?

330
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,704
Heather!

331
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,941
Sally! Please. Please.

332
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:08,612
I don't know where
everyone is but the
ship's not deserted.

333
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:12,316
I mean, maybe some of
us think that it is
but it's not,

334
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:13,949
so let's just go
to the bridge.

335
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,358
We'll find the skipper
and then we'll go home.

336
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,391
I saw someone.

337
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:21,125
Fuck.

338
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,861
Wait.

339
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,201
{clank}

340
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,073
Hello?

341
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:55,028
Did you see
who it was?
Was it Heather?

342
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,694
I didn't see.

343
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,499
I'm sorry.

344
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,039
{Downey}
Where're you going?

345
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,098
Why don't you
just help me out here?

346
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,904
What?

347
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:07,740
Just wait for Vic.

348
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:12,172
What?

349
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,240
It's fine.

350
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:14,876
Why can't we
go with him?

351
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:18,411
Let's just do as Greg
says and wait here
for Victor, okay?

352
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:19,581
Fine.

353
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,249
I think Victor's
in danger.

354
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,555
I'm not worried
about Victor.

355
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:26,621
I'm sorry I'm acting
weird. It's just I'm
having déjà vu

356
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:28,359
every time
I turn a corner.

357
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,695
No, no. No.

358
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,235
I know this place.

359
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,737
No, you don't
know this place.
You're just in shock.

360
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,272
That's funny.

361
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,399
What is it?
What is it?
Is it Tommy?

362
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:41,276
Is it guilt?
Is that what it is?
Do you feel guilty?

363
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:06,128
Hello?

364
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,011
Hello.

365
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:13,701
{door bangs}

366
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,731
{clank}

367
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:31,553
Hello.

368
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:35,649
We're on the third floor.
The bridge is exactly
two floors above us.

369
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,060
Greg, that was blood.
Are you just going to
ignore it?

370
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:41,098
I know guys that work
on ships like this.

371
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:44,498
They see us, they get bored.
They're just letting off
some steam.

372
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:48,562
What? They rescue us
from the sea and then
they just hide for fun?

373
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,073
Yeah.

374
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:53,110
Well, what's
your theory?

375
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,679
I don't know,
but I'm not,
but I'm not in shock.

376
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,773
I'll be in the ball room.
I'm getting off this ship.

377
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:02,342
Jess, fuck! Don't you
see that this is all
just in your mind?

378
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,857
Jess! Ships don't
just magically appear
out of nowhere.

379
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:10,520
They have skippers.
I mean, in your world
right now they don't.

380
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:19,063
My world is waiting
outside school for his
mother to pick him up.

381
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:22,300
Don't talk to me
about my world.

382
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:26,909
Jess. Jess, I'm sorry.

383
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,462
Is that blood?

384
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,238
Babe, come on, we're
supposed to meet them
in the theatre.

385
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,672
Heather!

386
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:01,007
Oh, my God. Shit.

387
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,410
Sally. Sal, come on.

388
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,848
Let's just go
to the theatre.

389
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:25,361
Downey, I can't see
anymore blood. I don't
think she's in here.

390
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,337
To be honest with you,
I don't think she's
even on the ship.

391
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,374
Okay. So whose
blood was that?

392
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,214
Hello?

393
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,652
Downey? Sally?

394
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,166
{door opens}

395
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:01,669
{thump}

396
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,247
Victor. What happened?

397
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,722
{groans}

398
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:54,288
Oh, my God.

399
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,253
{gunshot}

400
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:15,545
{Downey}
Stay with me, Greg.
Stay with me, man.

401
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,979
Stay with me, man.

402
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:19,642
{cries}

403
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,912
No. No!

404
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:24,319
You fucking bitch!
You shot him!

405
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,411
What?

406
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,048
He said you shot him.

407
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,717
I didn't!

408
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,919
Fucking liar!

409
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:31,394
I wasn't even
with Greg!

410
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:35,559
He's dead!
He's dead!
Look!

411
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,431
God, you're a bitch!

412
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,765
{sobs}

413
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,742
Get your hands off him!

414
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,506
I didn't do it!
I was with Victor.

415
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:51,080
Someone attacked him.

416
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,912
Someone?

417
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,482
You think I did it?

418
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:58,078
Why did you tell us
to come to the theatre?

419
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:02,320
I didn't. l--
Sally, I didn't.

420
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:03,917
I didn't.

421
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,463
My God, you're
a fucking skit so.

422
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:07,691
{shouts}

423
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,926
Sally, no.

424
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,265
{shotgun}

425
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,362
{groans}

426
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,838
{groaning}

427
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,941
Sally!

428
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,708
No!

429
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,944
Downey!
{cries}

430
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,681
{shouts}

431
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:32,381
Let it go. Let it go.

432
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,321
{shouting}
No!

433
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,735
{clank}

434
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:43,614
{footsteps}

435
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,655
Don't shoot. Please.

436
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,090
Please, don't
shoot. Please.

437
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,659
I have a son.
I have a son.

438
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,357
Shit.

439
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:19,745
Who are you?
Tell me!

440
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,243
Who are you?

441
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,514
{babbles}

442
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,113
What the fuck
are you saying?

443
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:28,385
It's the only way
to get home.

444
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:29,949
What?

445
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:32,052
You have to kill them.

446
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,233
Kill them!
Kill them!
Kill them!

447
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:04,720
{distant squawking}

448
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,391
{squawking}

449
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:16,796
{music played on
a scratched record}

450
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:56,303
{swing music}

451
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:28,202
{distant voices shouting}

452
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,860
Over here.
Come on. Hey!

453
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,860
{Sally}
Help us, please!

454
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:53,233
Help!

455
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:56,697
Hey. Hey.

456
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:58,503
Help us!

457
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,838
Please!

458
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:03,779
There, there. Over there.
I can see somebody.

459
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:05,940
{Sally}
Please!

460
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:09,019
{shouting continues}

461
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,557
{swing music}

462
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,919
{Victor}
Hello?

463
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:43,715
Looks like they decided
to scratch the welcome.

464
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,585
{Greg}
Let's go
to the bridge.

465
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:49,148
We'll get the captain
to put a call out to
the coast guard.

466
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,898
Hello!

467
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,966
Hello?

468
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:18,114
{Victor}
Where the fuck
is everybody?

469
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:25,322
{Downey}
Do you even know
where we're going?

470
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:35,932
Well, we're just,
just walking for
the sake of it.

471
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:41,601
You all right?

472
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,273
I feel like
I know this place.

473
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,976
I recognize
this corridor.

474
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:50,509
Liners, they look
pretty similar.

475
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,146
No, that's not it.

476
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,721
Jess, come on.

477
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:59,387
{Victor}
This is the same ship.
This thing's old.

478
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:02,796
{Downey}
Yeah. 1932.

479
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,028
It is the same.
Here's where we boarded.

480
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:08,697
Yeah. Aeolus.

481
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:10,967
Aeolus.

482
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,170
Aeolus was the Greek
god of the winds and
the father of Sisyphus,

483
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:17,543
the man condemned by the gods
to the task of pushing a rock
up a mountain

484
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,479
only to have it
roll back down again.

485
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,711
That's a shitty
punishment. What
did he do?

486
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:25,413
He cheated Death.
No, he made a promise
to Death that he didn't keep.

487
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:28,686
I studied him and I
can't remember. Can we
just keep on moving?

488
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:35,491
Hello?

489
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:45,596
{Sally}
Heather?

490
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:48,468
{Victor}
Hello!

491
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:53,400
Heather!

492
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:57,274
Heather!

493
00:46:57,348 --> 00:47:01,079
{Greg}
Sally. Please. I don't
know where everyone is.

494
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,744
But the ship's
not deserted.

495
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,256
I mean, maybe some of
us think that it is
but it's not,

496
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,791
so let's just go
to the bridge.

497
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:10,850
We'll find the skipper
and then we go home.

498
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:13,327
{Jess}
I saw someone.

499
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:16,763
{squawking}

500
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:59,065
Hello?

501
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:07,712
Hello.

502
00:48:18,162 --> 00:48:20,653
Shit. How did you
get here so fast?

503
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,258
Victor, you got, you
got to listen to me. We
don't have much time.

504
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:25,995
Oh, what's going on?
Where's Greg?

505
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,094
He's dead.

506
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:28,501
What?

507
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,403
No, I mean,
he was dead.
He's not dead now.

508
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:31,907
What are you saying?

509
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:35,604
Downstairs right now
is a copy of myself.

510
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:38,705
Me, walking and
talking with Greg.

511
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:41,708
Right.

512
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:50,189
There.

513
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,728
There's birds.

514
00:48:51,796 --> 00:48:53,593
No, that was
Downey's body.

515
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:56,632
I just left Downey
back there. How did
you get here so fast?

516
00:48:56,734 --> 00:48:59,100
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

517
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:04,770
{squawking}

518
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:13,277
No. Downey was there.
It was Downey's body.

519
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,251
There are bodies
all over this ship.

520
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:22,224
Your body is on the floor
at the restaurant with
a hole in your head.

521
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,659
Listen, I'm going to do
you a favour, okay?

522
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:26,889
I'm not going to tell
anyone about this.

523
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:31,333
It's the truth.
Victor, we got to get
off this ship right now.

524
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,403
You're saying there's
two of you now.

525
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,063
Yes.

526
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,663
And I'm dead
in the restaurant.

527
00:49:36,774 --> 00:49:38,298
You were killed.

528
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:42,140
Okay. So, I'm dead.
Downey's in the water.
He's dead, too.

529
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:44,305
Is Sally okay?

530
00:49:44,415 --> 00:49:46,849
See where I'm going
with this, right?

531
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:48,782
If we are dead and
there's two of you,

532
00:49:48,853 --> 00:49:50,844
how are we all going to
get off this ship?

533
00:49:50,955 --> 00:49:53,253
We should never have
boarded this ship.

534
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:55,019
I knew something
was wrong.

535
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:58,458
I should've forced you
to stay on the yacht
and you'd all be alive.

536
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:00,656
I've got to tell you
I feel pretty alive
right now.

537
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:04,928
Soon you're going to be dead.
Everything that happened
to you, happened before.

538
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,766
I can't even believe
I'm talking this shit.

539
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,296
You will die and then,
then Downey and Sally
and then Greg.

540
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:20,007
{groans}

541
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,351
{groans}

542
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:29,119
I didn't do this.
I didn't do it.

543
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:47,043
{Greg}
We're on the third level.

544
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:50,375
Greg, that was blood.
You just going to ignore it?

545
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:52,415
I know guys that work
on ships like this.

546
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,383
They see us, they get bored.
They're just letting off
some steam.

547
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:08,660
Don't you see that this
is all just in your mind?

548
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,257
Ships don't just
magically appear
out of nowhere.

549
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:14,860
They have skippers.
I mean, in your world
right now they don't.

550
00:51:14,939 --> 00:51:19,376
My world is waiting
outside school for his
mother to pick him up.

551
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,936
Don't talk to me
about my world.

552
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,888
{sobs}

553
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,894
{Jess}
Who are you?

554
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:43,223
Who are you?

555
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,655
{shouting}
Who are you?

556
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:43,750
Listen, listen to me.

557
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,022
Please, you have
to listen.

558
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:49,259
Kill them all.

559
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:52,461
If they board,
kill them.

560
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,932
Jess. Jess, you
got to kill them.

561
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,202
Please, you have
to listen.

562
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,607
Don't let them board.

563
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:04,944
No, no. No.
Please, please.
Stop, stop them.

564
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,279
If they board,
kill them.

565
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:09,717
Jess. Jess, you
got to kill them.

566
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,651
If they board,
kill them.

567
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:15,658
No, no. No.
Please, please, stop.
If they board, kill them.

568
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:18,991
Please, please stop.
Jess, Jess, Jess.

569
00:53:19,063 --> 00:53:21,657
Fuck you!

570
00:53:32,009 --> 00:53:34,534
{sobs}

571
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,289
Shit.

572
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,762
Tommy.

573
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,913
{Sally}
Is that blood?

574
00:54:52,556 --> 00:54:55,116
Babe, come on. We're
supposed to meet them
at the theatre.

575
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:23,643
Victor.

576
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,626
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

577
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:32,958
You know I didn't mean
to hurt you, right?

578
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:36,295
Now, I'm going to try
and get us off
this ship, okay?

579
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,095
{Jess}
Sally.

580
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,604
Sally?

581
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:47,533
Sally?

582
00:56:03,894 --> 00:56:05,555
Victor?

583
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:07,357
What happened?

584
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:25,209
You're not me.

585
00:56:41,198 --> 00:56:43,325
{whispers}
You're not me.

586
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:17,260
You see?
I'm not crazy.

587
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:24,634
Victor.

588
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:28,541
This didn't happen
before. Don't you see?

589
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,206
You tried to
strangle me, remember?

590
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,772
Now, you got to be strong.
I'm going to get the others.

591
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:35,579
{gunshot}

592
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:41,716
Downey, do something.

593
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,384
Stay with me, man.

594
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,223
Do something.

595
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,728
I don't know
what to do.

596
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:49,459
Is he dead?
Is he dead?

597
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:52,296
Greg. Greg.

598
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,661
You fucking--

599
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:58,332
Listen, I'm not going to
hurt you. We don't
have much time.

600
00:57:58,442 --> 00:57:59,909
Don't you point
that thing.

601
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:01,638
Move!

602
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,969
Go, go, go.

603
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:07,743
I hit her.
I think I hit her.

604
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,308
What's going on?
Who was that?

605
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:12,820
It's starting over again.
That's what's going on.

606
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:14,083
Let's go.

607
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,681
We can't leave
without Greg.

608
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:18,420
We'll come back
for Greg. I promise.
Let's go, come on!

609
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,598
We can change
the pattern.
Don't you see?

610
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:27,433
We change the pattern,
we're not trapped. Then
we get off this thing.

611
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,369
She's fucking mad.

612
00:58:29,473 --> 00:58:30,440
You think?

613
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,633
You have to
listen to me.

614
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,141
No, I don't have
to listen to you.

615
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:34,643
Was it me
that shot you?

616
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:36,201
I don't know.

617
00:58:36,313 --> 00:58:38,781
Whoa, wait.
Could we just take
a breath for a second?

618
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,010
Okay, Jess, I am prepared
to listen to you

619
00:58:41,118 --> 00:58:43,450
and even to believe
you, but you got to
make some sense.

620
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,217
I'm making perfect sense.
I'm going to get Victor, then
we get off this ship.

621
00:58:47,324 --> 00:58:49,986
Wait here.

622
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,826
And don't trust anyone.

623
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:56,388
If anyone comes,
you shoot them.

624
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,967
What are you
talking about?

625
00:58:58,035 --> 00:58:59,366
You shoot them.

626
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,335
What?

627
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:12,913
{whispers}
Victor.

628
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,509
Victor?

629
00:59:39,443 --> 00:59:41,240
{gunshot}

630
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,780
I said who is it?

631
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:56,255
I said who is it?

632
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,398
It's me, Jess.

633
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:15,373
Jesus Christ, what
the fuck happened to you?

634
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,413
A long story.

635
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:22,380
Where's Victor?

636
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,079
He's dead.

637
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:28,289
He fell over
the side.

638
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:31,921
How do we know
you didn't kill him?

639
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:33,622
You don't.

640
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,130
If you want to live,
you'll follow me.

641
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:43,297
Downey!

642
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:45,237
Ignore it.

643
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,401
Downey!

644
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,910
What's going on?

645
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:51,106
I said ignore it.

646
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:52,944
Where are you?
Call out.

647
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:57,476
No, lama not just
going to ignore it.
What is going on?

648
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:59,350
{whispers}
Where the fuck
are you?

649
01:00:59,456 --> 01:01:03,017
Call out!
You're in danger.
You're in danger.

650
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:05,526
Who is that?

651
01:01:05,629 --> 01:01:07,620
Not who you think?

652
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:17,667
So, what are we
doing in here?

653
01:01:19,376 --> 01:01:21,139
{shouts}

654
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:40,656
{Jess}
Sally!

655
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,459
Wait!

656
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,005
I'm sorry but
I love my son.

657
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,070
{groans}

658
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:01,011
Sally?

659
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:03,143
That wasn't me.

660
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,054
Sally?

661
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,341
{door opens}

662
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,783
Sally?

663
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:07,481
Hello? Hello?

664
01:03:07,584 --> 01:03:09,916
Please, can
you hear me?

665
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:12,420
Help me.
Please, help me.

666
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:14,150
She's killing everyone.

667
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:17,556
They're dead.
They're all dead.
Please--

668
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,390
Sally?

669
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:22,397
What's your
position? Over.

670
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,169
Sally.

671
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:32,571
Distressed caller,
we hear you. What are
your coordinates? Over.

672
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:39,081
Coast guard, did you hear
a distress call? We're not
getting in anymore. Over.

673
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:41,913
Greg.

674
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:44,510
Greg, is that you?

675
01:03:44,621 --> 01:03:46,782
{interference}

676
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:52,793
Distressed caller, make
another transmission.
What is your position?

677
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:55,126
Greg, can you
hear me? Greg.

678
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:57,860
{interference}

679
01:03:57,967 --> 01:03:59,628
Shit.

680
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:10,641
Sally?

681
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,678
Sally?

682
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:24,018
{Sally groans}

683
01:04:24,127 --> 01:04:26,687
{crying}

684
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,271
Oh, my God, what
happened to you?

685
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:18,404
Get away from me.

686
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:21,951
It wasn't me, Sally.
I didn't do this to you.

687
01:05:25,355 --> 01:05:27,880
{whispers}
It wasn't me.
Where is Downey?

688
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:30,619
I don't know
where he is.

689
01:05:30,727 --> 01:05:32,058
You killed him.

690
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:34,562
What?

691
01:05:34,631 --> 01:05:38,032
No, I didn't.
I didn't kill him.

692
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:39,227
What?

693
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:40,564
I swear.

694
01:05:40,637 --> 01:05:42,696
You're crazy.

695
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,797
Why are you
doing this?

696
01:05:44,908 --> 01:05:47,706
Sally, I know it's hard
but you got to trust me.

697
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,143
Got to trust me, okay?

698
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,499
Listen, you
got to hold on.

699
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:21,099
I think it will
return again.

700
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:25,238
The yacht, the Triangle,
I think it'll come back.

701
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:28,250
If it does, we'll escape,
me and you together.

702
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:31,116
We'll re-board it
and escape.

703
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:34,486
Please.

704
01:06:37,527 --> 01:06:39,859
Don't hurt me.

705
01:06:39,963 --> 01:06:42,329
Sally, I'm not
going to hurt you.

706
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,161
If you hold on,

707
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:48,863
you can see
Downey again.

708
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:10,018
{squawking}

709
01:07:12,295 --> 01:07:16,129
{voices shouting}

710
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:19,896
Hey, come on.
Over here.

711
01:07:20,003 --> 01:07:23,200
Hey. Hey. Help.

712
01:07:23,306 --> 01:07:25,900
It returns when
they're dead.

713
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:34,016
It returns when
everyone's dead.

714
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:50,529
Do you think Heather
would’ve made it
on board?

715
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,828
Honey.

716
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,493
There's a chance,
isn't there?

717
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,538
Yeah. Yeah,
there's a chance.

718
01:08:46,923 --> 01:08:49,391
Stop this thing.

719
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,552
Stop this fucking thing.

720
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:13,973
Please.

721
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:16,449
I want to go home.

722
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,752
I want to go home.

723
01:09:46,816 --> 01:09:50,445
He's dead.
I mean, he
was dead.

724
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,647
He's not dead now.

725
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:55,020
I was hiding and I saw
this version of myself,

726
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:58,890
and she had blood
on her face, and
then I killed her.

727
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:00,792
I killed her on
the front of the ship.

728
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,797
Listen, I'm going to
do you a favour, okay?

729
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,060
I'm not going to tell
anyone about this.

730
01:10:05,168 --> 01:10:07,068
It's the truth.
You got to listen to me.

731
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:09,468
No, I'm not listening
to another word you say.

732
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:13,373
You will die, and then
Greg and then Downey.

733
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:22,043
{footsteps}

734
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:35,659
{groans}

735
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:47,035
Don't be scared, Victor.
I can save you.

736
01:10:48,945 --> 01:10:51,436
I know how to save you.

737
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,253
You should try
and eat, babe.

738
01:12:11,194 --> 01:12:13,162
Jess?

739
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,134
Jesus, what
happened to you?

740
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:28,768
Where's Greg?

741
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:31,439
Greg told me to tell you
we should meet in
the theatre.

742
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:34,210
There's a theatre?

743
01:12:34,317 --> 01:12:36,945
Yes, it’s just
that way.

744
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,509
Where are you going?

745
01:12:38,621 --> 01:12:40,282
I'll see you there.

746
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,655
Okay, she's really
starting to freak
me out now.

747
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:23,495
Don't you see that this
is all just in your mind?

748
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:27,525
Ships don't just magically
appear out of nowhere.
They have skippers.

749
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:29,662
In your world
right now maybe
they don't.

750
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:34,836
My world is waiting
outside school for his
mother to pick him up.

751
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,778
Don't talk to me
about my world.

752
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:40,947
Jess.

753
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:42,881
Jess, I'm sorry.

754
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:21,919
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

755
01:14:21,991 --> 01:14:23,959
Okay.

756
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,722
Take it easy, man.

757
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,787
Just take it easy.

758
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,633
What did we do?
We're not part
of this boat.

759
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:38,297
We just got here, okay?
We've been walking around.
There's no one on it.

760
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:41,604
I can go right
now. I will go.

761
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:45,113
Okay? Just--
Just take it easy.

762
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:47,081
Take it easy.

763
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:48,912
Okay?

764
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,754
Jess?

765
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,924
Jess.

766
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,361
Jess, what
are you doing?

767
01:15:01,464 --> 01:15:05,924
What-- what is this?
Why-- what are
you wearing?

768
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,993
I don't want you
to see my face.

769
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:09,628
Why?

770
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:12,037
Because this
is not me.

771
01:15:12,141 --> 01:15:15,838
I'm somewhere out there
in the yacht and
you're with me.

772
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:20,808
And after I kill you,
we'll return.

773
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:23,044
Is that right?

774
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:28,054
You know, why-why
don't you just put
down the gun first?

775
01:15:28,157 --> 01:15:30,853
Okay? Come on.

776
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,451
You see, the boat
comes back when
you're all dead.

777
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,690
I've done everything
exactly like before.

778
01:15:35,798 --> 01:15:38,631
But when the boat
comes back, I'll be
ready, I'll be waiting.

779
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:43,070
I'll be on the landing bay.
I won't let any of them
board, even the other me.

780
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:45,504
I'll make them all stay
on the upturned yacht.

781
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:46,836
Okay.

782
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:50,902
Jess, we'll do
whatever you want.

783
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:54,380
Okay? Just, just
put down the gun.

784
01:15:57,253 --> 01:15:58,311
Come on.

785
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,877
I'm so sorry.

786
01:15:59,989 --> 01:16:01,547
No, no, no, no!

787
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:05,353
{Sally shouting}
Greg!

788
01:16:05,428 --> 01:16:07,259
Oh, God!
What happened?

789
01:16:07,363 --> 01:16:09,058
It was Jess.

790
01:16:09,165 --> 01:16:12,862
You fucking bitch!
You shot him. He
said you shot him.

791
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:14,402
I wasn't even
with Greg!

792
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:16,664
He's dead!
He's dead!

793
01:16:18,374 --> 01:16:20,934
My God, you're a
fucking skit so.

794
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:23,341
{shouting}

795
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,505
Downey!

796
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:28,410
{shouts}

797
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:41,956
Please.

798
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:44,758
Don't kill me.

799
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:49,321
I have a son.

800
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:10,841
Who are you?

801
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:12,838
Tell me!

802
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,507
They'll return.

803
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,346
Who are you?

804
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,909
They'll return.
You have to kill them.

805
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:20,511
It's the only way
to get home.

806
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,056
What the fuck
are you saying?

807
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:24,684
It's the only way
to save our son.

808
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,193
You have to kill them.

809
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:28,628
Kill them?
Kill them?

810
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:57,230
Hurry up, Sweetheart.
We're going to be late.

811
01:23:32,541 --> 01:23:34,133
What's fun in
buying you things

812
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:36,700
if you're going to leave
them in the fucking garden!

813
01:23:36,812 --> 01:23:38,871
I'm sick of telling
you this, Tommy.

814
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:43,110
I isn’t buying you anymore
toys if you can't look after
the ones you've got.

815
01:23:48,624 --> 01:23:51,024
Now what?

816
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:56,159
Oh, I'll just
clean it up, shall I?

817
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:02,129
Yeah, I'm just cleaning
the fucking mess!

818
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:08,734
What's the matter
with you, huh? What's
the matter with you?

819
01:24:08,844 --> 01:24:12,871
Just one day off
is all I ask. Just
one fucking day off!

820
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:18,649
I don't know why you
can't paint a picture
like a normal kid.

821
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,188
You get this
from your father.

822
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:23,520
He was an asshole, too.

823
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:39,567
Shit.

824
01:24:51,353 --> 01:24:53,116
Jack?

825
01:24:53,221 --> 01:24:55,746
Did you see anyone
ring my doorbell?

826
01:25:32,828 --> 01:25:34,420
Tommy?

827
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:37,660
Sweetheart, come here.

828
01:25:37,766 --> 01:25:41,395
Come here.
Come here!
It's okay.

829
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:44,462
{cries}

830
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:50,809
Mommy's fine,
you see?

831
01:25:52,447 --> 01:25:54,176
Mommy's fine.

832
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:59,781
You're just having
a bad dream. That's
all, baby.

833
01:25:59,855 --> 01:26:02,688
It's all it was.

834
01:26:02,791 --> 01:26:06,090
Bad dreams make you
think you've seen
things that you haven't.

835
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:54,706
Things are going to be
different now, Tommy.

836
01:26:56,511 --> 01:26:58,979
Mommy won't lose
her temper anymore,

837
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:01,208
even when you
do things wrong.

838
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:04,485
And she won't hurt you.

839
01:27:05,687 --> 01:27:07,814
I know she
won't hurt you.

840
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:11,222
You know how
I know that, Tommy?

841
01:27:11,326 --> 01:27:15,160
Because that woman that
did those things to you
is not Mommy.

842
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:18,324
This is Mommy.
Mommy's nice.

843
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,890
Shit.

844
01:27:23,939 --> 01:27:26,100
Shit.

845
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:39,443
{Tommy cries}

846
01:27:39,554 --> 01:27:41,715
Tommy, stay in the car.

847
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:43,917
I'm going to
bury it, okay?

848
01:28:00,575 --> 01:28:03,066
{pants}

849
01:28:45,453 --> 01:28:48,149
We have to go.
We have to get
out of here.

850
01:28:52,594 --> 01:28:54,926
Stop screaming, babe.

851
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:57,794
Please, Tommy,
it just blood.

852
01:28:57,866 --> 01:28:59,697
Stop screaming!

853
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:02,497
Tommy, look. See?
There, it's gone.

854
01:29:02,604 --> 01:29:04,868
See? There. It's gone.

855
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:36,791
Are you all right?

856
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:44,204
Who are you?

857
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:45,967
Just a driver.

858
01:30:52,881 --> 01:30:56,317
No point trying
to save the boy.

859
01:30:56,418 --> 01:30:59,387
There's nothing anyone
can do that's going to
bring him back.

860
01:31:02,991 --> 01:31:04,925
Can I give you a ride?

861
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:11,724
Yes.

862
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,496
Take me to the harbor.

863
01:31:36,825 --> 01:31:38,622
Hey.

864
01:31:43,798 --> 01:31:46,164
I'll leave
the meter running.

865
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:54,631
You will come
back, won't you?

866
01:31:57,012 --> 01:32:00,106
Yes, I-I promise.

867
01:32:08,623 --> 01:32:11,183
{squawking}

868
01:32:20,802 --> 01:32:22,030
Jess.

869
01:32:26,508 --> 01:32:28,203
Do you know me?

870
01:32:28,309 --> 01:32:31,870
I feel like I do.
Greg talks about
you enough.

871
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:35,645
Where is Greg?

872
01:32:35,717 --> 01:32:37,708
Where do you think?

873
01:32:37,819 --> 01:32:39,753
Come on, you're late.

874
01:32:39,854 --> 01:32:41,913
You're the one
with the kid, right?

875
01:32:42,023 --> 01:32:44,651
Yeah.

876
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:46,853
How come you didn't
bring him along?

877
01:32:53,868 --> 01:32:56,894
He's at school.

878
01:32:57,005 --> 01:32:59,565
You sure about that?

879
01:32:59,674 --> 01:33:01,505
Yes.

880
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:12,848
Are you okay?

881
01:33:12,921 --> 01:33:15,549
I don't think so.

882
01:33:15,623 --> 01:33:18,091
Hey, what's the matter?
What happened?

883
01:33:21,396 --> 01:33:22,863
Hey.

884
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,592
I'm sorry.

885
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:28,863
You have nothing
to apologize for.
What's the matter?

886
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:30,871
I'm just tired.

887
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:33,601
Listen, we don't
have to go today if
you don't want to.

888
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:36,370
No, I do.
I-I want to go.

889
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:38,742
Are you sure?

890
01:33:44,385 --> 01:33:46,319
{whispers}
Yeah.

891
01:33:46,421 --> 01:33:48,480
Yeah? Come,
come here.

892
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:58,065
This is Sally and
her husband, Downey.

893
01:33:58,133 --> 01:34:00,897
This is Heather,
Sally's friend. You
remember Victor.

894
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:02,766
Let's go sailing.

895
01:34:02,837 --> 01:34:04,805
Okay.
