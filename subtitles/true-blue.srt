2
00:00:57,369 --> 00:00:59,405
It's just sitting out there.

3
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,327
I say we take it.

4
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:10,842
See? There it is.

5
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:14,564
-Don't mess with that boat.
-It ain't nobody's, C.J.

6
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:18,239
-Why aren't you in school?
-It's summer, dumb-ass.

7
00:01:18,449 --> 00:01:20,121
Don't call me that, chubby.

8
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:22,399
-Leave the boat.
-It's ours now.

9
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:24,600
I saw a man put that in there.

10
00:01:24,809 --> 00:01:27,528
-He ain't here now.
-Finders keepers...

11
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:29,321
...Iosers weep--

12
00:01:32,889 --> 00:01:34,402
Holy shit.

13
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:10,439
They're here.

14
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:12,526
It's about fucking time.

15
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:16,005
Freebo's inside.
Bouton and I will use the stairs.

16
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:18,086
-Anybody else?
-A girl.

17
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:20,280
That makes it easy.

18
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:23,322
-Ricky said that's all.
-You trust him?

19
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:26,202
-Let's say hello.
-Where's the warrant?

20
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:29,719
-You were supposed to get it.
-No, you were.

21
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:34,960
Do you hear that?
Somebody's calling for help.

22
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:38,405
-Don't you hear that?
-Shit.

23
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:01,684
You didn't say
there were kids here.

24
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:04,164
You didn't give me a chance to.

25
00:03:04,369 --> 00:03:06,325
We gonna rock 'n' roll or not?

26
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:09,568
Go.

27
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:12,762
Police! Freeze!

28
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:14,925
Wrong room! Wrong room!

29
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:18,517
-Police! Don't move!
-Oh, shit!

30
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:20,242
It's empty! Toots!

31
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:27,607
Got them! Got them!

32
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:32,486
Don't be stupid.
Just stay where you're at.

33
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:34,441
You heard her. Be cool.

34
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:39,479
It stinks like shit in here.

35
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:41,919
Don't shoot. I didn't do anything.

36
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:56,881
This what you looking for,
you piece of shit?

37
00:03:57,089 --> 00:03:58,158
Rembrandt.

38
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:07,763
Stop right there!

39
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:37,083
I can't believe it!

40
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:39,723
-We had no choice.
-They jumped out.

41
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:42,762
We watched Freebo six months...

42
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:45,563
...and you just bust in there!

43
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:48,522
-You should've told us.
-I don't have to.

44
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:52,119
You had no warrant
and no probable cause!

45
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:54,604
-You weren't there.
-He's right.

46
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:57,562
Bull. He's got a long
history of fuckups.

47
00:04:57,769 --> 00:05:00,363
-Why--?
-I don't have to take this shit!

48
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:06,846
I'm tired of him riding me.

49
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:09,404
This happened to Tiger,
a great detective.

50
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,839
Keep him away from me, or else.

51
00:05:12,049 --> 00:05:15,962
This is why you have no partner.
You can't be a cowboy.

52
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:19,400
Now find a rock
and hide under it for a while.

53
00:05:19,609 --> 00:05:22,362
-I'm off the Martinez case?
-Let the others handle it.

54
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:27,085
Another case came up this morning.
Try not to fuck that one up. Okay?

55
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:34,320
Hey, Bass. How you doing?

56
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:37,043
-Hey, Rem. How's it going?
-All right.

57
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:39,362
What happened to him?

58
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:44,008
Him and some other winos
were shooting rats with a .357.

59
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:48,122
He jams the barrel in the mud
while he's stumbling around.

60
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:50,604
Plugged it up,
blew himself up.

61
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,128
Damn!

62
00:05:53,489 --> 00:05:56,162
Here's the hand those kids found.

63
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:57,484
It is female.

64
00:05:57,689 --> 00:05:58,724
You got an age?

65
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:00,282
My guess, 20s.

66
00:06:00,489 --> 00:06:01,604
-Prints?
-Good ones.

67
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:04,482
It was only in a few days.
I sent them off.

68
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:07,249
She wore a ring.
You can see the indent.

69
00:06:07,929 --> 00:06:10,443
Oh, yeah. Married, do you think?

70
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:12,048
Maybe.

71
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:23,077
Koko. Johnnie Walker Red.

72
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:35,207
Who's the new dancer?

73
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:37,639
Kind of hard on the eyes, huh?

74
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:40,887
Heard about you and Kenner.

75
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:46,088
-I was hoping you'd get a hit in.
-I guess my heart wasn't in it.

76
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:49,998
-I bet he was cleaning out his shorts.
-Thanks.

77
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,325
How can I get in your pants?

78
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:54,963
I've got one asshole in there already.

79
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:04,163
Here's to you guys getting Martinez,
with or without me.

80
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:07,406
Screw that.
Here's to long legs and big tits.

81
00:07:07,609 --> 00:07:08,758
I'm with that.

82
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:12,198
And by the way, how are Beck's?

83
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:15,205
-I wouldn't know.
-Yeah, right.

84
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:17,001
Toots says otherwise.

85
00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:21,007
-She's got an itch for you.
-You're dreaming.

86
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:24,804
-No, you guys'd make a nice couple.
-I will say this.

87
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:27,284
She's aces with a gun.

88
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,640
Everybody knows your dick
gets hard in a shootout.

89
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:33,488
You think Beck
gets wet around the taco?

90
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:35,761
What's so funny?

91
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:39,120
-We're just talking Mexican food.
-More drinks?

92
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:41,925
-No, thank you.
-No, I'm good.

93
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,165
-I gotta hit it.
-Rem?

94
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:47,839
Well, I ain't ready yet.
I'll have another one, Koko.

95
00:07:48,049 --> 00:07:49,482
You got it.

96
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:19,765
We're calling it a night, Rem.

97
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:07,678
I'm sorry.

98
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:09,720
I just needed some time.

99
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:44,369
-Good morning.
-You look like hell.

100
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:49,608
FBI matched a partial on that hand
Bass sent over.

101
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:51,322
Melanie Ann Hains.

102
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:54,043
She worked for the mayor.

103
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:56,365
All right, thanks.

104
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:10,601
-You C.J. Crowley?
-I might be. Who are you?

105
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:14,040
-I have some questions.
-I told them what I know.

106
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:18,561
Saw a man with the boat
but didn't get a good look at him.

107
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:21,203
-Did he see you?
-I don't think so.

108
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:24,082
It was dark and he wasn't
looking at me.

109
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:27,167
He put the boat in the water.
Then what?

110
00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:31,442
Nothing.
Watched it drift a while, then left.

111
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:35,528
Would you recognize the man
if you saw him again?

112
00:10:35,729 --> 00:10:38,448
I might, but then again I might not.

113
00:10:57,849 --> 00:10:59,760
This is killing her mother.

114
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:06,724
She was homecoming queen...

115
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:09,966
...honour student,
everybody's princess.

116
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:13,161
Well, Mr. Hains...

117
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:16,405
...did she have a boyfriend?

118
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,645
Yes, a college sweetheart.

119
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:21,805
It ended when she got her job.

120
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:25,208
His name was Benjamin. Alan Benjamin.

121
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:28,128
We know the family.
They were good people.

122
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:30,047
Did she wear a ring?

123
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:34,322
A gold band with diamonds
in the shape of a flower.

124
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:35,723
Did you find it?

125
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,482
No, sir.

126
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:42,641
The coroner noted the hand
had worn a ring.

127
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:48,685
Did she live alone in the city?

128
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:51,847
She had two roommates. Young women.

129
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:55,405
We met them a couple of times.
They seemed nice.

130
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:03,086
-Will you excuse me for a few minutes?
-Sure.

131
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:10,841
I hear they found a Purple Dragon
in the harbour.

132
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:14,803
-Looks like Tommy Trang's work.
-Why?

133
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:18,240
'Cause they stuck him like a roast pig.

134
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:21,043
That's why Benny pays
those guys so well.

135
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:23,763
Let me have a burger and fries, Koko.

136
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:27,166
No sheet on Melanie Hains.
Clean as a whistle.

137
00:12:27,369 --> 00:12:30,566
-She worked for the mayor.
-Smells like same old, same old.

138
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:33,124
Politics and young girls don't mix.

139
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:35,968
You gonna rattle some cages
at City Hall.

140
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:39,525
That's not what Monty meant by
hiding under a rock.

141
00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:45,604
-You talk to the roommates?
-They weren't at the apartment.

142
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,399
I guess I'll go now.

143
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:54,128
Want me to go with you?

144
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:59,368
If you had a shadow,
it'd probably take the heat off you.

145
00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:04,004
Sure. Why not?

146
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:08,998
I can't believe this happened.

147
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:10,961
How'd you find out?

148
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:12,966
Her father called here.

149
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:16,240
-And the other roommate?
-Jennifer?

150
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:19,401
She went to the shore last week.

151
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:23,966
Her friend has a beach house.
Melanie was gonna meet him there.

152
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:26,763
-And Melanie is Miss Hains?
-Yeah.

153
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:30,803
-When did Miss Hains leave?
-Friday night.

154
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:34,325
-Can I get you something?
-No.

155
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:36,804
I'll have a glass of water.

156
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:43,486
-Who's the friend at the shore?
-I don't know.

157
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,327
Has your roommate called?

158
00:13:46,369 --> 00:13:48,360
No. I'm kind of freaking out.

159
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,284
-Ms. Calderon--
-Call me Nikki.

160
00:13:52,489 --> 00:13:54,241
Nikki. What do you do?

161
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:57,486
I was in grad school
but I ran out of money...

162
00:13:57,689 --> 00:13:59,202
...so now I'm modelling.

163
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:00,967
What kind of modelling?

164
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:05,959
Hotel fashion shows
for businessmen.

165
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,887
Bikinis, lingerie,
that kind of thing.

166
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:14,799
-Why would this happen to Ms. Hains?
-I don't know.

167
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:17,123
Did she date men?

168
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:19,638
Yeah, this guy from the office.

169
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:22,807
His name was Martin something.

170
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:28,478
Do you mind if we look through
Miss Hains' things?

171
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:32,878
No, not at all.
I'll show you her room.

172
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:45,362
Are you from around here,
Miss Calderon?

173
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,244
I'm from a town
you never heard of.

174
00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:50,404
Try me.

175
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:55,524
-Medford Lakes, Ohio.
-Your folks still live there?

176
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:59,478
-My parents died in a car accident.
-Oh. I'm sorry.

177
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:02,764
Who's this?

178
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:07,406
Melanie's old boyfriend from college.
Nice guy. I met him once.

179
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:15,564
Was Ms. Hains into recreational drugs?

180
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:19,007
Not that I know of.

181
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,599
Do you really think she was murdered?

182
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:26,158
We're assuming the worst.

183
00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:32,125
Is this Jennifer with Miss Hains?

184
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:34,047
Yeah, it's Jen.

185
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:35,728
What was her last name?

186
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:40,719
Haller. H-A-L-L-E-R.

187
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:47,918
Do you know what she did for work?

188
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:51,802
She worked at a
medical phone exchange.

189
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:54,079
How long did she work there?

190
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:56,564
About three months.

191
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:39,404
If your roommate should phone in
or show up, call me.

192
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:41,839
Call if you think of anything.

193
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:44,877
You from the Mile?

194
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:47,607
-Me?
-Yeah.

195
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:49,927
Yeah. How'd you know?

196
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:53,724
You got that Irish accent.
I lived there. Whereabouts?

197
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:57,287
52nd Street, across from Harold Park.

198
00:16:59,369 --> 00:17:02,805
Hey, I'm not gonna be
in any danger here, am I?

199
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:07,645
No. Just lock the door behind us.
Okay?

200
00:17:12,729 --> 00:17:16,483
-You going back in?
-No, I got something I gotta do.

201
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:20,568
-Anna will check on the roommates.
-Thanks.

202
00:17:22,129 --> 00:17:25,246
-Going to the barbecue Saturday?
-I don't know.

203
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:27,883
-Everyone wants to see you.
-Right.

204
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:30,446
Whatever.

205
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:41,807
Tiger!

206
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:43,283
You there?

207
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:48,088
Be quiet!

208
00:17:52,649 --> 00:17:54,002
That you, Rembrandt?

209
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:55,917
Yeah.

210
00:17:56,129 --> 00:17:59,519
-Long time no see.
-Yeah.

211
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:04,398
The job, you know.
I need some help, partner.

212
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:12,997
Smooth, huh?

213
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:14,847
Made it myself.

214
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:16,198
Yeah.

215
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:18,206
Smooth as a baby's ass.

216
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:26,886
-So, what kind of help?
-Still got eyes inside City Hall?

217
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:29,239
-What do you need?
-A young woman.

218
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:32,998
-My favourite kind.
-I think she's dead.

219
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:35,885
My least favourite kind.

220
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:40,279
Melanie Hains.
She worked for the mayor's office.

221
00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:43,481
One of her hands showed up
in Taylor Pond.

222
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,281
I can't promise anything.

223
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:47,286
Anything would be great.

224
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:55,686
God, I miss you, Tiger.

225
00:18:57,689 --> 00:18:59,919
We had a lot of laughs,
didn't we?

226
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:04,887
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay. How about you?

227
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:06,922
I miss you too.

228
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:01,684
Sorry to bother you.
I didn't know where else to go.

229
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:05,568
Can I come in?

230
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:07,998
Yeah.

231
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:19,048
How'd you know where I lived?

232
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:21,365
52nd across from Harold Park.

233
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,198
I checked the phone book.

234
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:28,718
There's only one Rembrandt Macy.

235
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,762
Have a seat.

236
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:39,122
-Why didn't you go to the precinct?
-I did.

237
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:41,238
You weren't there.

238
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:42,643
Oh.

239
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:45,958
-You want a drink?
-Sure.

240
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:51,958
I'm scared.

241
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:55,163
-Why?
-Someone calls and hangs up.

242
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:57,041
I'm being followed.

243
00:20:57,249 --> 00:20:58,887
-By who?
-I don't know.

244
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:01,967
I feel like when I go out
someone's watching.

245
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:06,923
-Here.
-Thanks.

246
00:21:14,129 --> 00:21:17,280
I didn't exactly tell you
the truth earlier.

247
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:22,643
I think Jen and Melanie were
into something bad.

248
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:23,964
Like what?

249
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:27,320
A few weeks ago, Jen
didn't come home one night...

250
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:29,565
-...and Melanie freaked.
-Why?

251
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:32,567
I asked, but she went mental.
She wouldn't say.

252
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:37,968
She isn't the picture of
innocence everyone thinks she is.

253
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:39,966
Her and Jen party.

254
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:43,002
I mean, they party pretty hard.

255
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:46,762
Do you know who they partied with?

256
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:50,439
I guess guys from bars, clubs,
City Hall guys.

257
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:54,486
Did you lie about the drugs?

258
00:21:56,889 --> 00:21:58,766
-Sort of.
-Don't bullshit me.

259
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:02,322
I did coke with them
a couple of times.

260
00:22:05,249 --> 00:22:09,208
I guess Melanie's not exactly
as her dad described her.

261
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:12,321
If he only knew the half of it.

262
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:18,721
Look, it's getting late.

263
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:22,319
There's a hotel on 9th Avenue.
I'll get you a room.

264
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:25,362
Tomorrow we can
go collect your things.

265
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:27,446
I could stay here.

266
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:31,446
-That's a bad idea.
-I don't wanna go to a hotel.

267
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:34,685
I don't wanna be alone.

268
00:22:34,889 --> 00:22:37,608
I promise I won't
cause any trouble here.

269
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:40,888
Please.

270
00:22:42,689 --> 00:22:45,442
Okay, you can sleep on the couch.

271
00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:47,207
I'll get you a blanket.

272
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:58,482
There's a towel
under the bathroom sink.

273
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:00,558
Sorry I lied.

274
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:04,364
It's just when I heard about Melanie,
I got scared.

275
00:23:05,689 --> 00:23:07,566
I didn't know what to say.

276
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:13,285
Name's Rem.

277
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:14,604
Just call me Rem.

278
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:27,088
Nikki?

279
00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:32,923
Where have you been?

280
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:34,198
I'm sorry.

281
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:37,401
I needed some time
to work some things out.

282
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:38,928
God, I missed you.

283
00:25:56,449 --> 00:25:57,962
Nikki?

284
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:06,361
What, did I wake you up?

285
00:26:06,569 --> 00:26:09,447
No, I think I just overslept.
Come on in.

286
00:26:15,969 --> 00:26:18,642
-Another late night.
-Yeah.

287
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,320
Can I make you some coffee?

288
00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:26,646
Do you want
to go have breakfast?

289
00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:28,521
No, it's a bad time.

290
00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:31,004
I got some groceries
for breakfast.

291
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:37,044
No doubt that's some bad timing.

292
00:26:39,329 --> 00:26:40,728
Later.

293
00:26:49,689 --> 00:26:52,487
Who are all these people
in this picture?

294
00:26:52,689 --> 00:26:54,520
Friends of mine on the job.

295
00:26:54,729 --> 00:26:57,641
It was a precinct barbecue
about a year ago.

296
00:26:58,689 --> 00:27:00,486
The woman here earlier--

297
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:02,805
-What's her story?
-One of my partners.

298
00:27:03,649 --> 00:27:06,925
I'd say she
wants to be more than partners.

299
00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:10,005
And what about the Asian woman?

300
00:27:12,729 --> 00:27:14,640
Her name was May Lin.

301
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:16,567
''Was''?

302
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:17,918
She died.

303
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:21,927
Were you two close?

304
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:24,886
Let's not talk about it.

305
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:31,162
I can't take you
to your apartment as planned...

306
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:34,042
...so another cop,
a Detective Bouton--

307
00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:37,002
He's gonna bring you down
to the department.

308
00:27:37,209 --> 00:27:39,200
So I'll see you there later.

309
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:43,684
Thanks.

310
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:46,728
You're welcome.

311
00:28:02,249 --> 00:28:04,205
Pretty, huh?

312
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:07,125
They found him in his car.

313
00:28:07,329 --> 00:28:10,446
He ran an orphanage.
They say one of the kids did it.

314
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:15,283
I hope I never end up on your table.

315
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:18,479
I got the results on the hand.

316
00:28:18,689 --> 00:28:21,157
There was alcohol and trace cocaine.

317
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:23,277
I'm not surprised.

318
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:26,479
Our princess wasn't
so clean after all.

319
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:29,287
There's nothing on Nikki.

320
00:28:29,489 --> 00:28:32,686
But her boyfriend's been popped.
Frat prank.

321
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:36,325
He's been in South America
for the past six months.

322
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:39,601
That Jennifer Haller is
a different ball game.

323
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:42,482
Three priors for solicitation,
one conviction.

324
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:45,806
She was arrested
once at Joey Palo's.

325
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:47,283
Lap dancing.

326
00:28:47,489 --> 00:28:50,049
Too much lap, not enough dancing.

327
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:54,361
Creighton!

328
00:28:54,569 --> 00:28:56,924
-Where you been?
-Hiding.

329
00:28:57,129 --> 00:28:59,006
Do you know Jennifer Haller?

330
00:28:59,209 --> 00:29:02,087
-Should I?
-Yeah. You arrested her.

331
00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:04,962
Oh, yeah.
I remember that little peach.

332
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:06,887
Cronk and I brought her in.

333
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:11,002
She offered to do both of us if we
dropped her someplace.

334
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:14,485
-Ever see her again?
-I saw her dance a few times.

335
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:16,645
-What she do?
-Maybe nothing.

336
00:29:16,849 --> 00:29:20,637
Cronk claims he saw a photo of her
with some politician.

337
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:22,840
-What politician?
-Can't remember.

338
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:26,121
Yeah, it was in the Tribune
some months back.

339
00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:29,922
-Who was the politician?
-There was a few.

340
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:33,087
Tell me, one of them wasn't...

341
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:37,282
-...the mayor, was he?
-He was, now that you mention it.

342
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:41,118
And that Congressman Higgins
and some other guys.

343
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:43,445
How long ago was that article?

344
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:47,403
Christmas. It was some sort of
holiday party or something.

345
00:29:48,209 --> 00:29:50,040
I know Jennifer Haller.

346
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:53,480
Her snatch
could talk money out of your wallet.

347
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:55,441
Lisa, hit him again.

348
00:29:58,409 --> 00:30:00,161
When did you last see her?

349
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:04,078
Couple months ago.
I couldn't trust her no more.

350
00:30:07,649 --> 00:30:10,038
You ever see this girl?
They were roommates.

351
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:11,921
Don't think so.

352
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:15,605
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Lisa.

353
00:30:18,689 --> 00:30:20,725
This Haller chick--

354
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:24,001
Did she ever run around with
City Hall boys?

355
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:27,007
No, she was into
stockbrokers and Chinks.

356
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:29,518
She loved rich Hong Kong gooks.

357
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:31,959
She was exactly
what they wanted.

358
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:34,277
Meaning what, Joey?

359
00:30:34,489 --> 00:30:37,925
Some of those fuckers like that
rough trade.

360
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:40,927
-She was into S & M?
-You bet your ass.

361
00:30:41,129 --> 00:30:45,122
Word is, she could take a licking
and keep on ticking.

362
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:52,605
You want one of them?

363
00:30:53,889 --> 00:30:55,800
One of them?

364
00:30:56,009 --> 00:30:57,283
It'd be on me.

365
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:01,398
-Thanks for the drink.
-Anytime, Remy.

366
00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:03,480
Anytime.

367
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:20,489
That's Melanie and Jen in the back.

368
00:31:21,609 --> 00:31:24,487
-Who's the mook with them?
-I don't know.

369
00:31:24,689 --> 00:31:25,838
Oh, yeah.

370
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:29,359
Who was the guy that was
seeing Melanie at the mayor's office?

371
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:31,763
Martin.

372
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:38,246
-Find what you're looking for?
-I don't know.

373
00:31:38,449 --> 00:31:40,883
I'll print this. Check out the
guy in the background.

374
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:44,161
We might have our Martin.
See if the Tribunecan I.D. him.

375
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:45,961
Whatever you say, boss.

376
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:47,488
Thanks.

377
00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:51,688
Tiger!

378
00:32:00,969 --> 00:32:03,961
-Someone lives here?
-An old friend. Ex-cop.

379
00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:05,887
You've got strange friends.

380
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:07,124
And new ones.

381
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:11,758
This is Nikki. Nikki, Tiger Wu.

382
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:13,960
Hi, Tiger. Nice to meet you.

383
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:18,559
-Nikki was Melanie Hains' roommate.
-Sit, sit.

384
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:20,043
Thanks.

385
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:25,361
-Did you find out anything?
-The girl seems clean.

386
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:29,198
Saw some guy in the
mayor's office a few times.

387
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:32,640
Martin somebody.
I got Beck tracking him down.

388
00:32:32,849 --> 00:32:34,407
What about the mayor?

389
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:36,565
If there was something
down and dirty...

390
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:38,680
...it's not raising its head.

391
00:32:40,649 --> 00:32:44,927
We found a photo of the mayor's
last Christmas ball. Hains was there.

392
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,643
And Taylor Higgins
and Daniel Freita.

393
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:51,398
That's an interesting name.
Recently I heard a rumour...

394
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:53,122
...about Benny Lee...

395
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:54,444
...and Daniel Freita.

396
00:32:54,649 --> 00:32:58,005
Freita's a big shot. What would
they have in common?

397
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:02,441
The gaming commission awarded Freita
the one remaining licence.

398
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:07,040
There are two spots on the Blue Strand
for that last casino.

399
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:09,365
And guess who owns one of them.

400
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:12,680
-Benny Lee?
-The Chung triad...

401
00:33:12,889 --> 00:33:15,005
...is moving money
out of Hong Kong.

402
00:33:15,209 --> 00:33:19,839
Benny Lee used a chunk of it
to buy the property two years ago.

403
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:22,847
-Who owns the other piece of land?
-Some Germans.

404
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:26,325
So whoever makes the deal
could make millions.

405
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:28,963
Hundreds of millions.

406
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:32,366
And the loser's land
isn't gonna be worth shit.

407
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,480
This may mean nothing...

408
00:33:41,969 --> 00:33:44,881
...but I also heard
Daniel Freita's got a line...

409
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,681
...to Uncle Brother...

410
00:33:46,889 --> 00:33:48,845
...by way of Tommy Trang.

411
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:55,602
-Would you wait in the car?
-Sure.

412
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,241
What line?

413
00:33:59,449 --> 00:34:00,848
Nobody knows...

414
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:04,405
...but people have seen Tommy and
Freita together before.

415
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:08,602
Look here.

416
00:34:08,809 --> 00:34:12,279
Melanie Hains had a third roommate,
a Jennifer Haller.

417
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:15,242
She's got a red sheet
on her a mile long.

418
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:19,358
My contact said
she was into Asians.

419
00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:23,527
She was at the mayor's party
with Hains and Daniel Freita.

420
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,082
So?

421
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:27,883
Haller and Melanie
were to meet a friend.

422
00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:29,807
Nobody's heard from them.

423
00:34:30,009 --> 00:34:32,239
-Did you call the friend?
-No.

424
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:35,168
Nikki doesn't know her name.

425
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:37,405
Any contacts on Haller's sheet?

426
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:38,962
Yeah, her parents.

427
00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:41,888
They haven't talked to her
in three years.

428
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:44,967
-You know what you're doing?
-What do you mean?

429
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:53,806
She is young, isn't she?

430
00:35:04,609 --> 00:35:06,361
Her last name is Calderon.

431
00:35:06,569 --> 00:35:09,641
She's from a town in Ohio
called Medford Lakes.

432
00:35:10,729 --> 00:35:13,687
Do me a favour.
See what you can dig up on her.

433
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:19,240
Oh, God.

434
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:26,885
Yeah, I'm gonna clean up.

435
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:28,841
No, no. Don't.

436
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:40,363
What are those?

437
00:35:46,609 --> 00:35:47,724
Nothing.

438
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:48,805
Nothing?

439
00:35:51,409 --> 00:35:54,367
-I used to cut myself.
-Why?

440
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:59,207
Just something stupid I did
when I was young.

441
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:01,798
I don't wanna talk about it.

442
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:17,484
-Yeah?
-I did a crazy thing tonight.

443
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,598
I went to Chinatown
to see some people.

444
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:24,563
I was thinking maybe they can tell me
about Daniel Freita.

445
00:36:25,089 --> 00:36:27,398
Out of nowhere Eddie Trang shows up.

446
00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:30,203
He's got some PTK
punks with him...

447
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:32,445
...and none of them...

448
00:36:32,689 --> 00:36:35,362
...want to buy me a mai tai.

449
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:38,318
What happened?

450
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:42,602
He asks me what my business is
with Daniel Freita...

451
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:45,323
...and I tell him to
kiss my ass.

452
00:36:46,049 --> 00:36:49,086
Next thing I know I got a
gun in my face...

453
00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:52,679
...and nobody was smiling except me.

454
00:36:55,009 --> 00:36:56,806
Tommy Trang has Eddie
on a leash.

455
00:36:57,009 --> 00:36:59,648
You must have put a bug up his ass.

456
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:01,567
You know...

457
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:03,919
...there might be more
to this Freita thing.

458
00:37:04,609 --> 00:37:06,440
It was fun, Rem.

459
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:10,039
Just like the old days.

460
00:37:10,249 --> 00:37:11,682
Yeah.

461
00:37:11,889 --> 00:37:13,242
Good night.

462
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:14,802
Good night.

463
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:20,365
Something wrong?

464
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:29,320
You're on the couch again tonight.
I gotta get up early and do things.

465
00:37:29,529 --> 00:37:31,838
Then we're going to a barbecue.

466
00:37:36,009 --> 00:37:38,079
Did you say you found a body?

467
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,962
We found her hand.
Still looking for the body.

468
00:37:41,169 --> 00:37:44,320
-Did you have sex with her?
-We hadn't got that far.

469
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:47,521
We just went out
a few times to dinner.

470
00:37:47,729 --> 00:37:49,481
Did you do drugs with her?

471
00:37:50,929 --> 00:37:52,965
You get right to the point, huh?

472
00:37:53,169 --> 00:37:55,080
No point in wasting time.

473
00:37:56,209 --> 00:37:59,167
I can't speak for her,
but I don't do drugs.

474
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:00,802
Good.

475
00:38:01,009 --> 00:38:03,000
-You worked for the mayor?
-For a year.

476
00:38:03,209 --> 00:38:07,043
-And before that?
-I worked for the Freita Corporation.

477
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:08,918
Why'd you leave?

478
00:38:09,129 --> 00:38:10,687
More opportunities here.

479
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:15,202
You know her?

480
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,957
I met her at some black-tie thing
the mayor had for Mr. Freita.

481
00:38:21,169 --> 00:38:23,842
-She was with Melanie.
-And after that?

482
00:38:24,049 --> 00:38:26,005
Never saw her after that.

483
00:38:27,409 --> 00:38:30,128
She liked this guy
from the Freita Corporation.

484
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:32,718
-She got me to introduce them.
-Who?

485
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:36,124
His name is Oren Doba.

486
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:41,198
-He's gone. Went back to law school.
-I don't know what can I tell you?

487
00:38:41,729 --> 00:38:44,038
I haven't seen Jennifer in months.

488
00:38:47,169 --> 00:38:50,127
But you saw her a lot before,
didn't you?

489
00:38:53,489 --> 00:38:57,198
Look, I come from
an old Boston family, okay?

490
00:38:57,409 --> 00:39:00,207
You crossed the tracks
to get your dick wet.

491
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:03,958
Big whoop.
We don't care about your family tree.

492
00:39:04,169 --> 00:39:06,205
Just what you know about
Jennifer Haller.

493
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:08,127
She was wild. What can I say?

494
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:11,366
''Wild'' means different things.
Be specific.

495
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:13,437
She liked to party.

496
00:39:13,649 --> 00:39:15,207
You know, kinky stuff.

497
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:16,842
'' Kinky.''

498
00:39:17,049 --> 00:39:20,246
As in, ten lashes kind of kinky?

499
00:39:20,449 --> 00:39:22,007
Yeah.

500
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:23,918
And you?

501
00:39:25,689 --> 00:39:28,487
Sure. Why not?
It was something different.

502
00:39:28,689 --> 00:39:32,887
Well, if it hurt so good,
why did you stop seeing her?

503
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:34,886
She stopped seeing me.

504
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:38,764
It was all a scam anyway.
I was just a ticket to Freita.

505
00:39:46,729 --> 00:39:48,367
We can do this here...

506
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:51,561
...or we can go downtown.

507
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:53,327
Your call.

508
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:57,558
I want to help, but maybe
I should talk to a lawyer.

509
00:39:57,769 --> 00:39:59,168
You don't need one.

510
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:03,203
Just help us get to the next level.

511
00:40:05,009 --> 00:40:08,046
Freita liked to party hearty
now and then.

512
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:10,598
Did you party with him
now and then?

513
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:13,767
A few times.
At his penthouse.

514
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:16,608
-Was Jen Haller there?
-A couple times.

515
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:20,119
Did you see her with Freita?
I mean...

516
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:21,762
...intimately?

517
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:24,164
Once. Well, sort of.

518
00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:26,564
-Were they kinky?
-She came on to him.

519
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:29,044
It was a big party,
lots of people.

520
00:40:29,249 --> 00:40:33,640
She saved the heavy shit
for this club she liked at The Jungle.

521
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:36,563
Club 88?

522
00:40:37,409 --> 00:40:39,001
Yeah.

523
00:40:40,449 --> 00:40:42,440
Did she ever take you there?

524
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:43,718
Once.

525
00:40:45,649 --> 00:40:47,879
Did she take Freita to that club?

526
00:40:48,649 --> 00:40:49,843
I can't say.

527
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:55,285
Can't, or won't?

528
00:40:55,569 --> 00:40:59,721
I shouldn't say anything
else without my lawyer present.

529
00:41:05,649 --> 00:41:08,800
Every time you have one of
these barbecues it rains.

530
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:11,443
-Tell me about it.
-Remember last year?

531
00:41:11,649 --> 00:41:12,968
Yeah, it poured.

532
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:17,408
That was nice.

533
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:18,803
I want a ten.

534
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:21,882
Kinda young, Rem.

535
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:23,283
What?

536
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:24,968
Oh, come on, Lynn.

537
00:41:25,169 --> 00:41:28,798
He hasn't looked at me like that
since our wedding night.

538
00:41:29,009 --> 00:41:30,965
If your ass was that nice, I might.

539
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:33,487
Fuck you.

540
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:41,644
I don't like this Freita thing.
You're way out on a limb.

541
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:44,682
I got a kid who partied
with him and the Haller girl.

542
00:41:44,889 --> 00:41:49,326
I asked Tiger Wu to poke around,
and guess who pops up? Eddie Trang.

543
00:41:50,009 --> 00:41:51,647
Somebody's worried.

544
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:55,808
It's still a long way to Melanie Hains
and Benny Lee, for that matter.

545
00:41:56,009 --> 00:41:58,728
I mean, so Freita likes young women.

546
00:41:58,929 --> 00:42:00,726
Obviously, that is not a crime.

547
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:09,364
Don't bust my balls.
It's not what you think.

548
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,366
But she's staying at your place?

549
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:14,200
For the time being. It's temporary.

550
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:15,444
You're crazy.

551
00:42:16,689 --> 00:42:18,998
Look, if you do come up
with something--

552
00:42:19,209 --> 00:42:21,484
And I'm not telling you
how to play this.

553
00:42:21,689 --> 00:42:24,726
Just take it slow
and make sure it sticks.

554
00:42:24,929 --> 00:42:27,159
And please, bring it to me first.

555
00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:28,563
Absolutely.

556
00:42:28,769 --> 00:42:30,327
You're yanking a big dick here.

557
00:42:30,529 --> 00:42:31,723
I know.

558
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:34,322
-What?
-Look at Bouton.

559
00:42:34,529 --> 00:42:37,680
He's trying to get something.
He ain't getting nothing.

560
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,642
-Can I get a hot dog?
-He's persistent.

561
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:44,965
Anna's on the phone for you.

562
00:42:52,849 --> 00:42:54,077
Anna, it's Rem.

563
00:42:54,289 --> 00:42:57,440
-You boys having a fun time?
-You bet we are.

564
00:42:57,649 --> 00:42:59,719
I got something you might want to see.

565
00:42:59,929 --> 00:43:02,568
-What is it?
-You should see it for yourself.

566
00:43:02,769 --> 00:43:04,680
Come on, Anna. Can't it wait?

567
00:43:04,889 --> 00:43:07,562
I think you should see it right now.

568
00:43:07,769 --> 00:43:09,168
By yourself.

569
00:43:09,369 --> 00:43:11,121
All right, I'll come in.

570
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:12,603
Bye.

571
00:43:18,649 --> 00:43:20,321
What's she doing here?

572
00:43:20,529 --> 00:43:22,201
She's part of this investigation.

573
00:43:22,409 --> 00:43:24,843
So everybody seems
to be telling me.

574
00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:27,165
What you saw yesterday
isn't what you think.

575
00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:31,922
Don't dig a hole
that you can't get out of.

576
00:43:39,769 --> 00:43:42,761
Something's come up that
can't wait. I gotta go in.

577
00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:44,846
Okay, I'll go get changed.

578
00:43:45,049 --> 00:43:47,324
Try to relax. Have a good time.

579
00:43:47,529 --> 00:43:51,727
If I'm not back soon,
get Bouton to take you to my place.

580
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,078
Sure.

581
00:43:54,449 --> 00:43:55,928
Bye.

582
00:43:57,049 --> 00:43:59,404
Went through the Tribunephoto stock.

583
00:43:59,609 --> 00:44:02,840
Mostly party hats
and champagne smiles.

584
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:07,801
So Haller did meet
Freita at the party then.

585
00:44:08,009 --> 00:44:11,319
I'll bet she's telling
him what she wants for Christmas.

586
00:44:11,529 --> 00:44:13,804
Now, I almost missed this.

587
00:44:20,649 --> 00:44:25,165
I was wondering if your friend
mentioned she was there that night.

588
00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:35,398
-Hey, it's me.
-What's up?

589
00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:39,082
Have you dug up anything
on Nikki Calderon?

590
00:44:39,289 --> 00:44:41,928
A listing for Calderon
in Medford Lakes.

591
00:44:42,129 --> 00:44:46,486
It hasn't been in service in years.
I know a guy not far from there.

592
00:44:46,689 --> 00:44:50,045
-He'll see what he can see.
-I'll get back to you.

593
00:44:50,249 --> 00:44:52,444
This is a private thing, partner.

594
00:45:00,089 --> 00:45:02,728
This official business,
or are you just slumming?

595
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,842
You know her?

596
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:44,642
You're right on the edge here, lady.

597
00:45:45,689 --> 00:45:48,249
I don't pay those lawyers for nothing.

598
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:52,799
-When did you last see Jennifer?
-A month ago.

599
00:45:53,009 --> 00:45:56,126
She had a special client they did on a
regular basis.

600
00:45:56,329 --> 00:45:58,559
Then suddenly it just stopped.

601
00:45:58,769 --> 00:45:59,804
Is this him?

602
00:46:02,529 --> 00:46:04,918
No. He was Asian.

603
00:46:06,129 --> 00:46:07,642
Asian?

604
00:46:13,169 --> 00:46:14,921
You said they were doing.

605
00:46:15,129 --> 00:46:17,962
She had a partner. A blond.

606
00:46:18,169 --> 00:46:20,080
I think her name was...

607
00:46:20,289 --> 00:46:22,120
...Vicki or Nikki.

608
00:46:23,929 --> 00:46:25,567
Something like that.

609
00:46:32,769 --> 00:46:34,122
Get out of here!

610
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:37,559
-Get some clothes on.
-You're hurting me!

611
00:46:38,289 --> 00:46:39,768
Get fucking dressed now!

612
00:46:58,489 --> 00:47:01,003
I'm coming. I'm coming.

613
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,684
I know you're hungry, aren't you, boy?

614
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:38,558
What's wrong?

615
00:47:38,769 --> 00:47:40,680
I'll tell you what's wrong.

616
00:47:40,889 --> 00:47:43,687
I'm getting fucked,
and not even enjoying it.

617
00:47:43,889 --> 00:47:45,242
What are you talking about?

618
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:47,246
You forgot about the mayor's ball?

619
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:49,326
-I wasn't.
-Don't you lie to me.

620
00:47:50,169 --> 00:47:51,966
Just listen. I can explain.

621
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:55,047
And while you're at it,
explain why you were at the 88.

622
00:47:55,249 --> 00:47:56,967
I was at the mayor's ball.

623
00:47:57,169 --> 00:47:59,683
I didn't tell you or
you'd think I was in on it.

624
00:47:59,889 --> 00:48:02,767
-I'm listening.
-The 88 was because I needed money.

625
00:48:02,969 --> 00:48:05,005
You were fucking Daniel Freita!

626
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:09,405
I didn't touch Daniel Freita.
I'm talking about the priest.

627
00:48:09,609 --> 00:48:11,645
What priest? Priest, my ass.

628
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:13,168
Jesus!

629
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:22,846
When Jen saw Freita at the ball,
he went to the top of her wish list.

630
00:48:23,049 --> 00:48:25,005
He didn't call her after that.

631
00:48:25,249 --> 00:48:30,164
So she plays slap-ass with Oren Doba
to slip into Freita's world at the 88?

632
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,679
Freita didn't do the 88.
That was the priest.

633
00:48:32,889 --> 00:48:35,562
A fake minister Jen met
at one of Freita's parties.

634
00:48:35,769 --> 00:48:37,566
He was some fetish freak.

635
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:43,518
Jen thought if she added me to her
games with the priest...

636
00:48:43,729 --> 00:48:45,720
...then he would help out
with Freita.

637
00:48:46,849 --> 00:48:49,602
I never had to have sex.
I just got naked.

638
00:48:49,809 --> 00:48:51,925
Spare me the grisly details.

639
00:49:01,969 --> 00:49:04,005
How in the name of God...

640
00:49:04,209 --> 00:49:07,167
...did Melanie Hains
get involved in all this?

641
00:49:08,209 --> 00:49:11,679
Melanie was Jen's ticket
to meet men with money.

642
00:49:14,609 --> 00:49:16,486
Little girl lost.

643
00:49:16,849 --> 00:49:19,044
Daddy couldn't buy what she wanted.

644
00:49:19,249 --> 00:49:21,126
-So, what happened?
-That last night at the 88...

645
00:49:21,329 --> 00:49:23,047
...the priest got whacked out...

646
00:49:23,249 --> 00:49:25,285
...and said it'd never happen
between her and Freita.

647
00:49:25,489 --> 00:49:28,083
-Why not?
-Freita's not into women.

648
00:49:29,729 --> 00:49:31,799
His tastes run a little sweeter.

649
00:49:32,889 --> 00:49:34,641
-Children?
-Boys.

650
00:49:36,409 --> 00:49:39,242
From something
the priest calls the snake.

651
00:49:41,009 --> 00:49:42,362
You know what that is?

652
00:49:43,409 --> 00:49:44,808
Yeah.

653
00:49:47,889 --> 00:49:50,687
That's the Chinese illegal aliens.

654
00:49:54,009 --> 00:49:56,204
How did this guy know all that?

655
00:49:58,009 --> 00:50:00,648
Because he pimps the boys to Freita...

656
00:50:00,849 --> 00:50:02,885
...from this orphanage he runs.

657
00:50:07,209 --> 00:50:08,198
He's dead.

658
00:50:08,809 --> 00:50:10,242
-Who?
-The priest.

659
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:12,280
I saw him in the morgue.

660
00:50:24,369 --> 00:50:26,007
So it was blackmail.

661
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:29,884
Your roommates figured
Freita would pay...

662
00:50:30,089 --> 00:50:31,886
...to keep them quiet.

663
00:50:35,049 --> 00:50:36,198
How much?

664
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,558
A million.

665
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:39,997
Were you in on it?

666
00:50:42,689 --> 00:50:44,486
I swear, Rem.

667
00:50:44,689 --> 00:50:47,647
I said it was dumb,
but they wouldn't listen.

668
00:50:47,849 --> 00:50:51,398
Freita was meeting the girls
at the beach house?

669
00:50:51,609 --> 00:50:53,918
That's where he was gonna
bring the money.

670
00:50:54,129 --> 00:50:56,199
-Where is it?
-I don't know.

671
00:50:57,049 --> 00:50:58,687
I don't know, Rem.

672
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,561
They didn't tell me.

673
00:51:05,049 --> 00:51:06,562
I'm so ashamed.

674
00:51:08,089 --> 00:51:12,002
When I heard about Melanie,
I was so scared.

675
00:51:13,169 --> 00:51:15,967
I thought he'd kill me
if he found out I knew.

676
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:20,644
Rem, I'm sorry.

677
00:51:32,769 --> 00:51:35,329
It's me.
Leave a message at the tone.

678
00:51:36,129 --> 00:51:40,008
It's Beck. Pick up if you're there.
Something's gone down.

679
00:51:47,849 --> 00:51:52,001
I was at work when the call came.
Some security cops heard the shot.

680
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:55,645
-Did they see them?
-They were gone before they got here.

681
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:07,040
One round to the head.

682
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:11,208
Perp probably stood right here,
then killed the dog.

683
00:52:12,489 --> 00:52:13,968
It's not gonna fly, Rem.

684
00:52:14,169 --> 00:52:15,921
Come on, Monty.

685
00:52:16,129 --> 00:52:20,281
I got a kid who places Jennifer
at Freita's penthouse many times.

686
00:52:20,489 --> 00:52:22,764
She partied at his place.
Lots of people did.

687
00:52:22,969 --> 00:52:25,324
And I got a call
from the kid's attorney.

688
00:52:25,529 --> 00:52:27,724
He said his client
would not pursue this.

689
00:52:27,929 --> 00:52:29,647
We can drag him into court.

690
00:52:29,849 --> 00:52:31,885
-Get serious.
-What about her story?

691
00:52:32,089 --> 00:52:33,966
You think someone
will go after Freita...

692
00:52:34,169 --> 00:52:37,764
...on the say-so of some model
who moonlights in fuck games?

693
00:52:37,969 --> 00:52:39,163
-It's true!
-It's hearsay!

694
00:52:39,369 --> 00:52:42,759
Some nut getting his ass whipped
while he rambles bullshit...

695
00:52:42,969 --> 00:52:44,721
...about a respected citizen?

696
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:48,126
-Rambling at a girl that's now dead.
-Not dead. Missing.

697
00:52:48,329 --> 00:52:51,844
She could be whipping some
guy's ass in Bumfuck, Egypt.

698
00:52:52,049 --> 00:52:55,086
And we can't produce
Melanie Hains' body either.

699
00:52:55,289 --> 00:52:57,757
No grand jury in this state
would touch this.

700
00:52:57,969 --> 00:53:00,688
Look, don't you see the connection?

701
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:04,120
You got Daniel Freita, Benny Lee
and the Trang brothers.

702
00:53:04,329 --> 00:53:06,923
These girls opened a can of worms
and got killed...

703
00:53:07,129 --> 00:53:10,485
...along with the orphanage guy
and Tiger Wu.

704
00:53:12,369 --> 00:53:15,327
Look, bring me something solid
and I'll run with it.

705
00:53:15,529 --> 00:53:17,918
-I won't put my ass on the line.
-What do I need?

706
00:53:18,129 --> 00:53:20,768
For starters,
how about Melanie Hains' body?

707
00:53:23,129 --> 00:53:24,960
I know you don't want to hear this...

708
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:27,478
...but I think you're getting a little
obsessed with this girl.

709
00:53:27,689 --> 00:53:30,328
-Aw, Jesus.
-You could get her hurt.

710
00:53:34,609 --> 00:53:37,840
What I'm thinking is this:

711
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:42,637
What if we tell Freita what we know?

712
00:53:42,849 --> 00:53:46,000
Maybe that will rattle him enough...

713
00:53:46,209 --> 00:53:48,404
...to open the door
on Benny Lee and the Trangs.

714
00:53:48,609 --> 00:53:52,204
You know the price
Freita would pay if he turned on them.

715
00:53:53,489 --> 00:53:55,525
Oh, God, I don't believe this.

716
00:53:55,729 --> 00:53:57,606
You know you can't connect
the dots.

717
00:53:58,689 --> 00:54:01,920
All you can do is cause trouble,
end up on street duty.

718
00:54:02,129 --> 00:54:05,166
And that's if Monty takes it
to the next level.

719
00:54:05,929 --> 00:54:09,160
Don't forget, Daniel Freita
is on the police commission.

720
00:54:13,449 --> 00:54:15,804
I gotta go. Word to the wise:

721
00:54:16,009 --> 00:54:17,727
Get her someplace far away.

722
00:54:17,969 --> 00:54:22,520
They wouldn't be looking for her if
they didn't think she knew something.

723
00:54:27,689 --> 00:54:29,486
What did she mean...

724
00:54:31,089 --> 00:54:35,640
...about you knowing what would happen
to Freita if he turned on them?

725
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,207
What?

726
00:54:43,809 --> 00:54:46,926
Well, there was this tong murder
I investigated.

727
00:54:49,009 --> 00:54:52,399
This punk drug dealer offed
a jack boy...

728
00:54:53,569 --> 00:54:57,164
...and I talked him into
ratting out Eddie, Tommy's brother.

729
00:55:01,409 --> 00:55:03,240
The dealer ended up dead...

730
00:55:04,169 --> 00:55:06,000
...and Eddie Trang walked.

731
00:55:08,049 --> 00:55:09,402
So...

732
00:55:10,449 --> 00:55:12,280
...Tommy takes it personal.

733
00:55:14,569 --> 00:55:15,922
You see...

734
00:55:17,049 --> 00:55:20,359
...Asians don't like to lose
what they call ''face.''

735
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:35,117
And then I end up standing in the
street one night with May Lin.

736
00:55:37,489 --> 00:55:39,480
One minute she's in my arms...

737
00:55:40,849 --> 00:55:44,080
...and the next, she's lying
in the rain, dead.

738
00:56:27,369 --> 00:56:30,520
This is exactly why no one wants
to partner with you.

739
00:56:30,769 --> 00:56:33,408
Why you carry this
loser is beyond me.

740
00:56:33,609 --> 00:56:36,123
You're getting obsessed
with this girl.

741
00:56:52,129 --> 00:56:53,687
Are you okay?

742
00:56:54,769 --> 00:56:56,600
Yeah, I'm okay.

743
00:56:58,889 --> 00:57:00,720
You should get some sleep.

744
00:57:06,889 --> 00:57:10,120
Tell me I'm wrong about the way
you look at me.

745
00:57:15,209 --> 00:57:18,167
Tell me you really want me
to go to sleep.

746
00:57:22,969 --> 00:57:25,324
Or do you want something else?

747
00:57:41,969 --> 00:57:43,846
Tell me what you like.

748
00:57:52,729 --> 00:57:54,048
Everything.

749
00:58:53,769 --> 00:58:55,600
Is this where they shot you?

750
00:59:03,729 --> 00:59:06,118
I've gotta find a way to nail them.

751
00:59:10,889 --> 00:59:13,005
I've been thinking about that.

752
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:23,366
Why not pick up
where Melanie and Jen left off?

753
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:30,008
It sounds crazy, but what
if we did their blackmail thing?

754
00:59:35,369 --> 00:59:36,927
Get serious.

755
00:59:39,369 --> 00:59:41,724
Monty's right. You said it yourself.

756
00:59:41,929 --> 00:59:44,284
You can't prove a thing.
Let's hurt them.

757
00:59:44,489 --> 00:59:48,038
-I'm a cop. It's illegal.
-So was killing May Lin.

758
00:59:49,689 --> 00:59:51,168
And Tiger.

759
00:59:57,689 --> 00:59:59,919
If we bounce this back at Freita...

760
01:00:01,209 --> 01:00:03,086
...he'd kill us...

761
01:00:04,089 --> 01:00:06,125
...like Melanie and Jennifer.

762
01:00:07,329 --> 01:00:09,160
Trust me on that.

763
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:14,325
Not if we were smarter.

764
01:00:18,929 --> 01:00:20,920
You think this is just a game?

765
01:00:21,129 --> 01:00:22,960
No, Rem.

766
01:00:23,169 --> 01:00:26,286
This isn't just a game.
I know we can be killed.

767
01:00:30,489 --> 01:00:32,366
But you heard Beck.

768
01:00:35,969 --> 01:00:38,358
They know I know.
They'll find me.

769
01:00:39,729 --> 01:00:42,243
So either I start running right now--

770
01:00:49,369 --> 01:00:51,405
I feel good with you, Rem.

771
01:00:57,009 --> 01:00:59,523
Do you want to know why I cut myself?

772
01:01:00,729 --> 01:01:04,358
It's because my life was shit,
and all I knew was pain.

773
01:01:07,329 --> 01:01:09,797
But when you look at me...

774
01:01:10,009 --> 01:01:11,806
...when you touch me...

775
01:01:15,569 --> 01:01:18,527
...I feel like my heart's
gonna stop beating.

776
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:21,677
And I don't feel the pain.

777
01:01:22,249 --> 01:01:24,558
I feel good.

778
01:01:25,409 --> 01:01:28,207
And I've never known
anything like that...

779
01:01:28,409 --> 01:01:30,206
...anyone like that.

780
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:37,565
Ever.

781
01:01:47,929 --> 01:01:50,443
We can do this, Rem.

782
01:01:51,609 --> 01:01:53,406
It's a million dollars.

783
01:01:54,609 --> 01:01:56,406
Do it for that...

784
01:02:00,449 --> 01:02:02,280
...and for May Lin.

785
01:04:09,489 --> 01:04:11,639
-We're closed.
-Open it.

786
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:13,248
-Fuck you.
-Open it!

787
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:15,758
-What, you gonna shoot me?
-Move!

788
01:04:15,969 --> 01:04:18,688
What the fuck? You gonna off me?

789
01:04:28,009 --> 01:04:29,806
I'm looking for Benny Lee!

790
01:04:30,009 --> 01:04:32,728
-He's gonna fucking kill you!
-Shut up!

791
01:04:40,609 --> 01:04:43,248
Long time no see, Rembrandt.

792
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:45,565
What brings you back to Chinatown?

793
01:04:45,769 --> 01:04:47,919
I was missing you and your brother.

794
01:04:48,769 --> 01:04:51,841
And where is Tommy?
Chasing a poodle for lunch?

795
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:56,042
-What you want?
-I want to talk to Benny Lee.

796
01:04:56,249 --> 01:04:58,809
-Why would he want to see you?
-Daniel Freita.

797
01:05:01,569 --> 01:05:04,288
-You put your gun away.
-I'd rather not.

798
01:05:04,489 --> 01:05:08,528
What are you afraid of?
You think we're gonna kill you?

799
01:05:08,729 --> 01:05:11,402
The thought had crossed my mind,
Eddie.

800
01:05:25,049 --> 01:05:28,724
You some dumb-ass?
Sticking nose where it don't belong.

801
01:05:30,289 --> 01:05:33,008
A man could get hurt doing that.

802
01:05:33,209 --> 01:05:35,564
Sometimes his friends too.

803
01:05:35,769 --> 01:05:39,284
-I'm not here to play games.
-Why did you come here?

804
01:05:42,009 --> 01:05:45,081
-To tell you a story.
-I'm not into stories.

805
01:05:45,289 --> 01:05:47,519
-You'll like this one.
-What's it about?

806
01:05:47,729 --> 01:05:49,720
Daniel Freita, little boys...

807
01:05:49,929 --> 01:05:52,443
...and the money you took to buy land.

808
01:06:08,889 --> 01:06:09,844
Go on.

809
01:06:11,649 --> 01:06:14,117
Big money, big deal.

810
01:06:15,609 --> 01:06:18,999
But you need Freita's
gaming licence to swing it.

811
01:06:20,169 --> 01:06:22,729
So Tommy here comes up
with the idea...

812
01:06:22,929 --> 01:06:26,080
...of how to get him in bed
with you assholes.

813
01:06:26,289 --> 01:06:29,406
And that's when the
Reverend Moi steps into the picture.

814
01:06:30,809 --> 01:06:33,323
-Story get any better?
-Yeah, it does.

815
01:06:33,529 --> 01:06:37,317
It seems that Daniel Freita's
got an itching for young boys...

816
01:06:37,529 --> 01:06:39,759
...and you have
an endless supply of them.

817
01:06:39,969 --> 01:06:43,325
So Freita's indebted forever,
and it's sealed with a kiss.

818
01:06:43,529 --> 01:06:48,045
Until Jennifer Haller and
Melanie Hains show up.

819
01:06:55,889 --> 01:06:58,449
Reverend plays
''spank me'' with the girls...

820
01:06:58,649 --> 01:07:02,244
...and in a moment of passion
he tells them everything.

821
01:07:02,449 --> 01:07:04,405
So they put the squeeze play on...

822
01:07:04,609 --> 01:07:07,487
...and that's where the Trangs
step up.

823
01:07:07,689 --> 01:07:10,362
Bottom of the ninth, four dead.

824
01:07:10,569 --> 01:07:14,118
The two girls,
the Reverend Moi, of course...

825
01:07:14,329 --> 01:07:16,126
...and my friend, Tiger Wu.

826
01:07:22,569 --> 01:07:25,322
-That's a fanciful story.
-I thought you'd like it.

827
01:07:25,529 --> 01:07:27,918
I just said it was fanciful.

828
01:07:30,769 --> 01:07:32,600
-What do you want?
-Money.

829
01:07:32,809 --> 01:07:35,562
-What do I get?
-I never tell my story.

830
01:07:35,769 --> 01:07:37,600
You never hear from me again.

831
01:07:37,809 --> 01:07:39,765
You're a dead man.

832
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,122
How much?

833
01:07:49,969 --> 01:07:51,800
The one million the girls wanted.

834
01:07:56,209 --> 01:08:00,122
And another million for what they
did to May Lin Choi.

835
01:08:00,329 --> 01:08:02,126
You're fucking nuts!

836
01:08:04,929 --> 01:08:07,602
-Two million's too much.
-It's not negotiable.

837
01:08:07,809 --> 01:08:11,722
If the deal with Freita goes bad,
the triads lose their money.

838
01:08:11,929 --> 01:08:14,045
And if that happens...

839
01:08:14,249 --> 01:08:16,717
...we both know what'll happen to you.

840
01:08:18,449 --> 01:08:20,644
-How do I know this will go away?
-My word.

841
01:08:20,849 --> 01:08:24,159
Why shouldn't I hang
you with the rest of this meat?

842
01:08:24,369 --> 01:08:26,929
It's like you see in the movies.

843
01:08:27,129 --> 01:08:29,324
It's all been prearranged...

844
01:08:29,529 --> 01:08:32,760
...should I disappear or end up dead.

845
01:08:35,129 --> 01:08:38,246
-You bluffing me?
-That's for me to know...

846
01:08:38,449 --> 01:08:40,246
...and you to find out.

847
01:08:46,569 --> 01:08:47,968
You've got balls, cop.

848
01:08:49,489 --> 01:08:50,683
So we got a deal?

849
01:08:58,009 --> 01:09:01,445
You fuck me, you better run
and keep on running.

850
01:09:02,609 --> 01:09:04,406
Tonight then.

851
01:09:08,649 --> 01:09:11,641
This'll tell you where and when.

852
01:09:12,169 --> 01:09:14,637
You bring the cash. Alone.

853
01:09:15,849 --> 01:09:18,204
I need more time to get the money.

854
01:09:18,409 --> 01:09:21,242
Oh, you'll manage it somehow, Benny.

855
01:09:22,009 --> 01:09:23,681
Of that I'm sure.

856
01:09:37,009 --> 01:09:38,920
Hey. They bought it.

857
01:09:39,129 --> 01:09:40,926
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

858
01:09:41,129 --> 01:09:43,324
And I upped it to two million.

859
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:47,807
Oh, my God.

860
01:09:48,009 --> 01:09:49,806
You gotta get out of there.

861
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:54,921
-What are you gonna do?
-I got things to do. We'll meet later.

862
01:09:55,129 --> 01:09:57,120
The old train station on 8th.

863
01:09:57,329 --> 01:09:59,081
It's been shut down for a while.

864
01:09:59,289 --> 01:10:02,122
It's empty at night.
We'll meet there at 1 1 .

865
01:10:03,369 --> 01:10:04,927
Are you okay with this?

866
01:10:07,889 --> 01:10:09,208
I want you.

867
01:10:13,889 --> 01:10:15,766
You got me.

868
01:10:39,649 --> 01:10:42,209
So they put the squeeze play on.

869
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:44,206
That's a fanciful story.

870
01:10:45,049 --> 01:10:46,448
What do you want, cop?

871
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:52,120
He didn't know.

872
01:11:02,449 --> 01:11:05,646
-Monty in?
-Gone for the day. He's headed home.

873
01:11:05,849 --> 01:11:09,478
Some guy's been trying to reach you.
Toby Carr.

874
01:11:10,569 --> 01:11:12,082
Thank you.

875
01:11:19,209 --> 01:11:21,006
Where's Toots, Bouton?

876
01:11:21,209 --> 01:11:24,406
A woman got stabbed in the subway.
I'm meeting him.

877
01:11:24,609 --> 01:11:27,760
-What about Beck?
-I haven't seen her all day.

878
01:11:27,969 --> 01:11:29,766
-Check you later.
-Yeah.

879
01:11:51,409 --> 01:11:54,048
-Yeah?
-Mr. Toby Carr?

880
01:11:54,249 --> 01:11:57,639
-Who wants to know?
-Detective Macy. You called me.

881
01:11:57,849 --> 01:12:01,524
I've been checking out
that thing for you and Tiger.

882
01:12:01,729 --> 01:12:04,004
-And?
-There were some Calderons...

883
01:12:04,209 --> 01:12:06,200
... in Medford Lakes a while ago.

884
01:12:06,409 --> 01:12:08,320
But they died in a car wreck.

885
01:12:08,529 --> 01:12:11,566
-What about their daughter?
-There was none.

886
01:12:11,769 --> 01:12:15,728
But there was a grandmother
in Parks until she died last year.

887
01:12:15,929 --> 01:12:18,045
She was a foster parent.

888
01:12:18,249 --> 01:12:20,922
One of her charges
was a girl named Nicole.

889
01:12:21,129 --> 01:12:24,599
She lived with her until she was
1 3, then she ran off.

890
01:12:24,809 --> 01:12:27,004
Her real name's Donato.

891
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:29,006
That's all I could get you.

892
01:12:31,809 --> 01:12:33,322
Thank you.

893
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:42,759
-Nicole Donato. Run it.
-I'm busy--

894
01:12:42,969 --> 01:12:44,800
Do it now, Anna!

895
01:12:45,649 --> 01:12:47,480
I'll be at my desk.

896
01:12:50,049 --> 01:12:52,768
-Hello?
-It's Rem Macy. Is Monty home?

897
01:12:52,969 --> 01:12:54,561
No, he went downtown.

898
01:12:54,769 --> 01:12:57,761
If he checks in, I'll have him call.

899
01:12:57,969 --> 01:12:59,687
Great. Thank you. Bye-bye.

900
01:12:59,889 --> 01:13:01,208
Bye.

901
01:13:02,969 --> 01:13:04,402
Donato, Nicole Lee.

902
01:13:04,609 --> 01:13:06,804
Two priors, underage prostitution.

903
01:13:07,009 --> 01:13:09,807
They didn't flag it.
Four months in juvie.

904
01:13:10,009 --> 01:13:13,160
I didn't have time
to check the arrest report.

905
01:13:16,569 --> 01:13:19,083
You're not in trouble, are you?

906
01:13:20,969 --> 01:13:23,199
Are you in trouble?

907
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:29,883
Her real name's Donato.

908
01:13:30,089 --> 01:13:32,398
You would think I was in on it.

909
01:13:34,129 --> 01:13:36,359
The work records for Ms. Hains....

910
01:13:38,969 --> 01:13:42,439
We've got Freita, Benny
and the Trang brothers.

911
01:13:44,089 --> 01:13:47,001
It's a long way back to Melanie Hains.

912
01:13:58,289 --> 01:14:00,120
To take away that pain.

913
01:14:01,489 --> 01:14:03,320
It hurts to lose.

914
01:14:04,609 --> 01:14:06,884
So is killing May Lin.

915
01:14:08,089 --> 01:14:09,920
Bring it to me first.

916
01:14:11,409 --> 01:14:13,240
What if we did that?

917
01:14:15,849 --> 01:14:18,443
We can do this, Rem.

918
01:14:41,129 --> 01:14:43,962
Tell me I'm wrong about
the way you look at me.

919
01:14:47,849 --> 01:14:49,726
When you look at me...

920
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:54,920
... when you touch me...

921
01:14:59,969 --> 01:15:02,802
...I feel like my heart's
gonna stop beating.

922
01:15:10,289 --> 01:15:12,484
I don't feel the pain.

923
01:15:17,089 --> 01:15:18,966
I feel good.

924
01:15:27,569 --> 01:15:29,366
You got me.

925
01:16:24,689 --> 01:16:28,204
If you don't hear from me
by midnight, open it.

926
01:16:29,569 --> 01:16:31,685
Wait. What's this about?

927
01:16:31,889 --> 01:16:33,925
Midnight. Just do it.

928
01:17:23,729 --> 01:17:25,048
Here.

929
01:17:32,129 --> 01:17:33,960
I missed you.

930
01:17:38,889 --> 01:17:42,199
-Where'd you get this?
-I've had it.

931
01:17:42,409 --> 01:17:44,764
I've never seen you wear it before.

932
01:17:44,969 --> 01:17:47,767
I found it when I was
packing up my stuff.

933
01:17:47,969 --> 01:17:49,766
Emerald?

934
01:17:49,969 --> 01:17:51,288
Yeah.

935
01:17:55,049 --> 01:17:57,324
That doesn't look like $2 million.

936
01:17:58,289 --> 01:17:59,961
Benny couldn't raise it.

937
01:18:00,169 --> 01:18:02,922
Here's one.
He'll get you the other.

938
01:18:03,129 --> 01:18:04,847
-We'll take the million.
-Stop.

939
01:18:05,049 --> 01:18:07,165
-What do you mean?
-Leave it.

940
01:18:07,369 --> 01:18:08,927
The deal's off.

941
01:18:09,129 --> 01:18:12,405
-Don't fuck with us!
-Put the gun away!

942
01:18:13,449 --> 01:18:15,405
Why are you doing this, Rem?

943
01:18:17,009 --> 01:18:18,840
-We've been set up.
-What?

944
01:18:20,209 --> 01:18:22,723
Her real name is Donato.

945
01:18:22,929 --> 01:18:25,568
There's a sheet on her. Two priors.

946
01:18:25,769 --> 01:18:28,920
The arresting officer
was Jack Monteleone...

947
01:18:29,129 --> 01:18:31,324
...also known as Monty.

948
01:18:31,529 --> 01:18:34,043
-Maybe you've heard of him.
-Who cares?

949
01:18:34,249 --> 01:18:37,559
He knew how I felt
about you and your brother...

950
01:18:37,769 --> 01:18:41,284
...and what you did to the one
decent thing in my life.

951
01:18:42,809 --> 01:18:45,004
And he knew I'd
get back at them.

952
01:18:47,609 --> 01:18:48,598
Didn't he?

953
01:18:50,289 --> 01:18:52,644
It was the hot dog vendor.

954
01:18:52,849 --> 01:18:55,238
He saw this man in the photo.

955
01:18:58,489 --> 01:19:00,639
And then there's Melanie's ring.

956
01:19:03,329 --> 01:19:05,160
In the shape of a flower...

957
01:19:09,209 --> 01:19:11,848
...with diamonds and an emerald.

958
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:16,446
Where is he?

959
01:19:18,849 --> 01:19:20,726
Right here.

960
01:19:22,089 --> 01:19:26,958
-Early bird catches the worm, huh?
-Hand me the piece. Slow and easy.

961
01:19:28,329 --> 01:19:31,446
-What are you gonna do?
-Who is this ass--?

962
01:19:40,489 --> 01:19:42,844
What the hell took you so long?

963
01:19:46,609 --> 01:19:48,327
If it's any consolation...

964
01:19:48,529 --> 01:19:51,168
...I know what you've gone through.

965
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:53,360
It's hell to say no to her.

966
01:19:54,249 --> 01:19:55,728
Can we go now?

967
01:19:56,689 --> 01:19:59,806
What? She's got no stomach for murder?

968
01:20:01,809 --> 01:20:04,323
-I'm going.
-Hey, what's your hurry?

969
01:20:04,529 --> 01:20:09,159
People are dying here tonight.
At least we can tell them why.

970
01:20:11,089 --> 01:20:12,920
When did you figure this out?

971
01:20:13,129 --> 01:20:15,927
When Benny didn't know
what I was talking about.

972
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:19,447
The girls didn't blackmail Freita.

973
01:20:19,649 --> 01:20:22,959
You killed them to set up a
fake murder case...

974
01:20:23,649 --> 01:20:27,198
...and let Nikki turn
an Academy Award-winning trick.

975
01:20:27,649 --> 01:20:31,767
The fucking you get
ain't worth the fucking you get.

976
01:20:31,969 --> 01:20:34,563
-Why me?
-Somebody had to take the heat.

977
01:20:34,769 --> 01:20:37,442
If Benny decided to
whack and not pay...

978
01:20:37,649 --> 01:20:40,209
...I figured better you than me.

979
01:20:42,409 --> 01:20:46,368
-I don't see this working.
-Nobody hates Tommy more than you.

980
01:20:46,569 --> 01:20:48,480
That's how it's gonna look.

981
01:20:48,689 --> 01:20:53,001
I say you were working some crazy
scheme to shake Benny down....

982
01:20:54,009 --> 01:20:57,479
-See where I'm going?
-No. It's full of loopholes.

983
01:20:57,689 --> 01:20:59,998
Like me being Nikki's
arresting officer?

984
01:21:00,209 --> 01:21:03,884
That's interesting,
if you were around to point it out.

985
01:21:04,209 --> 01:21:05,961
-You won't be.
-Why are you so sure?

986
01:21:06,169 --> 01:21:09,081
-Meaning what?
-Meaning I wrote it down...

987
01:21:10,169 --> 01:21:13,878
...along with her arrest report
and gave it to Beck.

988
01:21:15,209 --> 01:21:18,281
-What's so damn funny?
-The look on your face.

989
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:22,839
I never thought this would work.

990
01:21:23,049 --> 01:21:25,438
When Nikki gave me
the blackmail idea...

991
01:21:25,649 --> 01:21:29,437
...I thought it was risky, but
Beck convinced me it wasn't.

992
01:21:29,649 --> 01:21:31,321
After that, it was her show.

993
01:21:31,529 --> 01:21:35,727
There were times it got so crazy
I thought about walking away.

994
01:21:35,929 --> 01:21:40,127
Especially when you mentioned
Medford Lakes.

995
01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:42,797
-But Tiger sealed the deal.
-You fuck!

996
01:21:47,649 --> 01:21:50,447
Let's get this over with.
Give me his gun.

997
01:21:50,649 --> 01:21:53,766
-I'm taking this to the car.
-You stay there!

998
01:21:56,889 --> 01:21:58,447
They're gonna kill you.

999
01:22:00,489 --> 01:22:02,719
-Go on. Tell her.
-Come on, Rem.

1000
01:22:02,929 --> 01:22:04,647
The show's over.

1001
01:22:04,849 --> 01:22:06,840
Don't you see it, Nikki?

1002
01:22:07,049 --> 01:22:10,359
They'll say you took the
money, so you take the heat.

1003
01:22:10,569 --> 01:22:13,606
Always trying to ride in and save
the day, huh?

1004
01:22:13,809 --> 01:22:17,722
-You might've been a decent cop.
-Is that what you are?

1005
01:22:17,929 --> 01:22:22,480
This isn't where the good guy beats
the bad guy with a true heart.

1006
01:22:22,689 --> 01:22:25,283
You beat him by making money off him.

1007
01:22:25,489 --> 01:22:27,844
-You're the bad guys.
-We are?

1008
01:22:28,049 --> 01:22:28,959
Why?

1009
01:22:29,169 --> 01:22:33,003
Because we killed some street trash
and a debutante fuck toy?

1010
01:22:33,209 --> 01:22:36,884
Or a crackhead dealing
kiddie sex to the man of the year?

1011
01:22:37,849 --> 01:22:42,240
Or some dumb cop who decides to
cash in with some young thing...

1012
01:22:42,449 --> 01:22:44,679
...to keep him company in his old age?

1013
01:22:44,889 --> 01:22:47,926
Who the fuck are you to call
us the bad guys?

1014
01:22:59,929 --> 01:23:03,638
I won't say anything.
You know that.

1015
01:23:03,889 --> 01:23:06,005
Sure, baby, we know that.

1016
01:23:07,009 --> 01:23:09,728
I'll just take my share and disappear.

1017
01:23:10,329 --> 01:23:12,206
You'll never hear from me.

1018
01:23:13,049 --> 01:23:14,687
Yeah. That's good.

1019
01:23:15,889 --> 01:23:17,481
Cap him.

1020
01:23:17,689 --> 01:23:19,168
No, he's gone.

1021
01:23:22,449 --> 01:23:25,043
With this money, I could get lost--

1022
01:23:25,849 --> 01:23:27,407
Will you shut up?!

1023
01:23:30,049 --> 01:23:32,517
-I'm scared.
-There's no reason to be.

1024
01:23:32,729 --> 01:23:35,687
-What if he was right?
-He was fucking with you.

1025
01:23:35,889 --> 01:23:39,165
What's to stop you
from killing me when we leave?

1026
01:23:39,369 --> 01:23:41,087
You have to trust us.

1027
01:23:41,289 --> 01:23:44,087
We are some very rich motherfuckers!

1028
01:23:55,729 --> 01:23:57,879
Where the hell did you get that?

1029
01:24:01,409 --> 01:24:04,640
Monty gave it to me
a few years ago...

1030
01:24:04,849 --> 01:24:07,841
...in case anyone tried to hurt me.

1031
01:24:31,849 --> 01:24:33,282
Keep breathing.

1032
01:24:41,289 --> 01:24:44,326
That's what May Lin
said that night she died.

1033
01:24:51,849 --> 01:24:53,885
The trick is...

1034
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:56,080
...to keep breathing.

1035
01:24:59,089 --> 01:25:00,363
You won't make it.

1036
01:25:01,489 --> 01:25:03,719
I didn't want this.
They made me.

1037
01:25:03,929 --> 01:25:05,487
No more lies!

1038
01:25:06,609 --> 01:25:08,440
Rem, we can still do this.

1039
01:25:09,889 --> 01:25:13,245
We can take this money
and just get out of here.

1040
01:25:13,449 --> 01:25:15,246
I would've done it.

1041
01:25:17,369 --> 01:25:19,599
That's how much I wanted you.

1042
01:25:21,809 --> 01:25:24,198
Even when I knew it was wrong.

1043
01:25:24,409 --> 01:25:26,365
We still can.

1044
01:25:30,129 --> 01:25:31,562
Trust--

1045
01:25:32,689 --> 01:25:34,361
You can still trust me.

1046
01:25:35,769 --> 01:25:37,839
Okay? I cared about you.

1047
01:25:38,969 --> 01:25:41,085
For the first time in my life...

1048
01:25:41,289 --> 01:25:43,120
...I had something real.

1049
01:25:44,089 --> 01:25:45,966
Trust, Nikki.

1050
01:25:48,929 --> 01:25:52,558
Why is it so damn hard for you?

1051
01:25:54,889 --> 01:25:57,608
Who made you this way?

1052
01:25:59,249 --> 01:26:00,648
Everybody.

1053
01:26:04,369 --> 01:26:06,929
Everybody I've ever known.

1054
01:26:10,049 --> 01:26:12,358
Not everybody.

1055
01:26:22,649 --> 01:26:24,367
It's up to you.

1056
01:26:29,449 --> 01:26:31,280
Whatever you want.

1057
01:26:43,969 --> 01:26:45,322
Maybe...

1058
01:26:57,849 --> 01:27:00,158
...another time, another place.

1059
01:27:02,609 --> 01:27:04,964
I'm sorry.

1060
01:28:03,729 --> 01:28:05,526
I don't wanna die.

1061
01:28:10,329 --> 01:28:12,718
Nobody does.

1062
01:29:52,449 --> 01:29:54,280
Got something for you.

1063
01:29:57,169 --> 01:29:59,444
That's less the hundred grand.

1064
01:30:01,969 --> 01:30:03,880
Think you can make this work?

1065
01:30:04,089 --> 01:30:06,842
It is. Don't you read the papers?

1066
01:30:09,089 --> 01:30:10,920
You're a smart guy, cop.

1067
01:30:12,609 --> 01:30:14,281
I could use a smart guy.

1068
01:30:15,369 --> 01:30:18,406
-No, I don't think so.
-Too bad.

1069
01:30:18,609 --> 01:30:20,486
You could do one thing.

1070
01:30:20,689 --> 01:30:22,964
-What?
-Keep Freita under control.

1071
01:30:23,169 --> 01:30:27,959
-No more playtime for him.
-That's already done. Is that it?

1072
01:30:31,369 --> 01:30:33,724
There is one more small favour.

1073
01:31:02,769 --> 01:31:06,478
-You want something else?
-Not unless it has hair on it.

1074
01:31:07,569 --> 01:31:09,844
Dream on.

1075
01:31:10,849 --> 01:31:12,680
I can't believe they did it.

1076
01:31:12,889 --> 01:31:16,518
-I can. I never trusted him.
-It's just so weird, man.

1077
01:31:16,729 --> 01:31:19,448
Him and Beck running dope
with Eddie Trang.

1078
01:31:19,649 --> 01:31:21,321
Who'd have thought of that?

1079
01:31:21,529 --> 01:31:23,804
He went to a lot to set you up.

1080
01:31:24,009 --> 01:31:25,886
Just so you'd take the fall.

1081
01:31:26,089 --> 01:31:29,764
I don't know about you,
but ripping off 1 00 grand...

1082
01:31:29,969 --> 01:31:32,642
...that's no small chunk of change.

1083
01:31:32,849 --> 01:31:35,044
You are one lucky white boy...

1084
01:31:35,249 --> 01:31:37,479
...that your gun jammed with mud.

1085
01:31:38,689 --> 01:31:40,202
Yeah, lucky.

1086
01:31:40,409 --> 01:31:42,639
Next time you'll call for backup.

1087
01:31:43,809 --> 01:31:45,686
Like Monty always said...

1088
01:31:45,889 --> 01:31:49,006
...when it came to police work,
I'm a cowboy.

1089
01:32:16,609 --> 01:32:18,042
Thanks.

1090
01:32:18,329 --> 01:32:19,808
Good night, Rem.

1091
01:32:21,449 --> 01:32:24,247
-Take care of yourself.
-You too, Anna.

1092
01:32:25,929 --> 01:32:27,647
You're crazy, man.

1093
01:32:29,369 --> 01:32:32,088
-How's the wing?
-Stronger every day.

1094
01:32:32,289 --> 01:32:34,200
The news about Tommy will help.

1095
01:32:34,409 --> 01:32:36,479
-What happened to him?
-Got shot.

1096
01:32:36,689 --> 01:32:41,285
-Found him under the Bay Bridge.
-Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

1097
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:44,083
I would've paid a lot
to see that.

1098
01:32:44,289 --> 01:32:45,881
Yeah, me too.

1099
01:32:46,089 --> 01:32:48,045
-You coming with me?
-Yeah.

1100
01:32:48,249 --> 01:32:49,762
Peace, Rem.

1101
01:32:49,969 --> 01:32:51,766
Good night, guys.
