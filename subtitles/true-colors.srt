<i>Good evening and welcome back</i>
<i>to</i> Election '90 <i>at Channel 3.</i>

3
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,050
<i>The polls have just closed</i>
<i>in Connecticut...</i>

4
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,615
Drinks coming through.

5
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,691
Stop it!

6
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,816
- We got it!
- We got Bridgeport!

7
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,695
Did you hear that?
We got Bridgeport. I knew it.

8
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,453
Hey, Pete, Channel 8.

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,817
<i>This is</i> Connecticut News Tonight

10
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,218
Telephone. Telephone, Tim.

11
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,089
Thank you. Hello. Yeah, Tom.

12
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,212
Yeah. I hope so. About 15 minutes or so.

13
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,253
<i>With 53% of the precincts reporting in,</i>

14
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,170
<i>Channel 8 now projects that three-time</i>
<i>incumbent Senator James B Stiles</i>

15

<i>has defeated Stuart Hutchinson,</i>

16
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,899
<i>giving Senator Stiles a fourth term.</i>

17
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,576
<i>In that close race for the fourth</i>
<i>Congressional district, the Gold Coast,</i>

18
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,137
<i>both our exit polls and the precincts</i>
<i>already reporting in...</i>

19
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,331
Showtime!

20
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,094
<i>Peter.</i>
<i>Peter Tomorrow's-looking-good Burton,</i>

21
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,177
<i>a man I loved,</i>

22
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,611
<i>the kind without the mousetraps</i>
<i>of sex and marriage,</i>

23
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,699
<i>spared the contortions</i>
<i>that families require.</i>

24
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,695
<i>The love men can have for one another,</i>
<i>love without need,</i>

25
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,576
<i>struck in acquaintance,</i>

<i>God, if only it were that simple.</i>

29
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,533
All yours.

30
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,771
Thank you.

31
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,298
- What?!
- Shit!

32
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,616
- Damn it!
- That's it!

33
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,857
What the hell do you think you're doing?

34
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,052
Witness! Witness!
Witness! Negligent!

35
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,252
- Sorry.
- Sorry doesn't make her cherry again.

36
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,658
- Are you blind?
- You pulled into my spot. It's just a dent.

37
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,169
It's not a big fucking deal!

38
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,817
It's just a dent? Maybe on your car,
farmer, but on mine...

39
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,332
Nobody solved problems with violence.
That's what's wrong with the world.

40
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,734
Come on, break it up!

41
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,896
Stop it, this is so macho!

42
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,659
Hey, how are you doing? I'm...

43
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,215
- Get out of my room!
- Your room?

44
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,618
- This is my room!
- This is my room!

45
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,975
42, I'm afraid so.

46
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,978
- I don't believe this.
- Jesus!

47
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,452
OK, look, what if I apologise, OK?

48
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,450
You're right, it was my fault. I'm sorry.
Really, OK? No hard feelings.

49
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,128
Why fight if it was your fault?

50
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,891
First impressions are important.
I slink out of my car and say,

51
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,254
"Here I am, folks. Say hi to a total
asshole"? No. I stand up for myself.

52
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,614
- I create doubt as to whose fault it was.
- That's what you were doing?

53
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,291
I got the dented car, not you.
It's no skin off your nose.

54
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,412
- Everybody makes out, right?
- Wrong.

55
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,252
First law school, then you become a
sleazebag with no regard for the truth.

56
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,096
- I've met guys like you before.
- Yeah?

57
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,010
You got that face, got that smile,

58
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,929
got that corduroy suit
that comes with elbow patches.

59
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,893
You got one of those suits?

60
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,093
So what?

61
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,614
Just curious.

62
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,618
- Which is 42?
- Over there.

63
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,052
Tim! Garrity, come on.
You can run but you can't hide.

64
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:51,050
Stubblefield? You dog, I heard an ugly
rumour you were going to be here.

65
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,411
Tim Garrity,
you'll never amount to anything.

66
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:01,173
- Your mother and I are disappointed.
- You'll have to try harder, that's all.

67
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,940
- How you doing?
- Great. You?

68
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,212
- BJ said there was a fight. See it?
- No...

69
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:12,016
Yeah, a guy got what was coming
to him and will live in shame for ever.

70
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,896
- I'm sorry I missed it...
- Sorry, Doug Stubblefield, Peter Burton.

71
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:22,697
Good to know you. I got a keg on ice,
you won't believe who's here, so let's go.

72
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,174
I'll be there.

73
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,896
- Anyone you want to ask?
- Girls? The place is crawling with them.

74
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,933
If you want, I can go and see
about changing rooms.

75
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,858
I'd understand.

76
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:44,375
I got a colour TV and subscriptions
to <i>Time</i> and <i>National Geographic.</i>

77
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,616
Three credit cards and a guy
at Hialeah phones me sure things.

78
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,893
- I'm Tim Garrity.
- Peter Burton.

79
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,736
- Want to come to Stubblefield's?
- No, don't want to butt in.

80
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,649
Come on. He's a jerk, all right,
so consider it punishment.

81
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,409
- Come on.
- OK.

82
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,177
- Where are you from?
- Providence, Rhode Island. You?

83
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,417
All over. We moved around a lot.

84
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,612
- College?
- Georgetown. You?

85
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,697
UConn.

86
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,978
<i>Ignorantia juris non excusat.</i>

87
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,695
"Lgnorance of the law is no excuse."
Robinson versus Virginia.

88
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:34,258
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
who can give me the facts of the case?

89
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,936
Mr Burton.

90
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,372
Proximate cause.
Train conductor pushes a passenger.

91
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:48,098
Guy's carrying firecrackers. Falls to the
ground. Exploding, injuring bystander.

92
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,972
Foreseeability?

93
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,298
The railroad company couldn't foresee
the box containing fireworks

94
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,776
or that their employee's actions
could cause injury.

95
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,369
The reasonable man's standard?

96
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,256
Foreseeability and proximate cause
make for a reasonable man?

97
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,532
We may not always get what we want
or what we need,

98
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,494
just so's we don't get
what we deserve.

99
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,898
- So her parents were down the hall?
- We're not fucking in the living room!

100
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,890
I wouldn't imply anything as base and
vulgar as that. Let me get this straight.

101
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,979
It's breakfast. You're sitting with
Senator and Mrs Stiles.

102
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:40,619
The happy millionaires eat breakfast,
Diana's there, apple of Dad's eyes...

103
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,094
Stamford.

104
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,770
He pulls those telegenic blue eyes
on you and says what?

105
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,972
- Good morning.
- You're missing something.

106
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,059
- What do you do at a girlfriend's?
- They're not senators' daughters.

107
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,971
- Where are you going?
- London, in fact.

108
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,138
My parents are in Geneva.
Some World Bank thing.

109
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,491
Christmas in London?
Plum pudding and Marley's ghost.

110
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:09,855
It's mostly Arabs and rain. I'm flying
into New York. Want to get together?

111
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,132
The Stiles throw this famous
New Year's Eve party.

112
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,460
I want you to meet Diana.
Here, let me give you the number.

113
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:23,211
Nobody has a pen in this situation.
What a guy!

114
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,219
- Hey, don't forget your stuff.
- Merry Christmas!

115
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,972
Three turkey white.

116
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,499
<i>Two turtle doves...</i>

117
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,693
<i>And a partridge in a pear tree</i>

118
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,293
17.84.

119
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,178
- You really got to go?
- I still got some presents to buy.

120
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,338
Believe it or not.
Talk about last minute.

121
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,169
Plus, I promised my sister-in-law
I'd make the desserts.

122
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,737
I'd ask you to come, but it's just family.

123
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,896
Sorry.

124
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,489
I hate to see someone alone
on Christmas Eve.

125
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,010
- Will you be OK?
- I'll be fine.

126
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,531
Merry Christmas.

127
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,172
<i>And they sing of Christmas.</i>
<i>Bah, humbug!</i>

128
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,931
<i>Might as well close shop for the night.</i>
<i>We'll finish tomorrow.</i>

129
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,973
<i>But, sir, tomorrow is Christmas Day.</i>

130
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,051
- Tim! Pete.
- <i>Hey, how are you doing?</i>

131
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,935
- Good. How are you?
- <i>How was London?</i>

132
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,497
- Great. It snowed and everything.
- <i>So, where are you now?</i>

133
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:21,014
New York City. I've got to visit my
aunt and uncle in Hartford tomorrow.

134
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,530
I was wondering if I could stop in
and say hi.

135
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,459
Come up here New Year's Eve.

136
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,333
I checked, it's fine. Got a tux?

137
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,738
- Sure, no problem.
- <i>All right. Let me give you directions.</i>

138
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,855
- <i>Take the Triborough Bridge...</i>
- Hold on, let me get a pen.

139
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,736
- OK, go.
- <i>New England Freeway to exit four...</i>

140
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,739
- All right, tomorrow afternoon?
- <i>See you tomorrow.</i>

141
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,294
You the owner?

142
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,651
- You want a tux at 9 a. M?
- Why would I call you at home?

143
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,613
- Cash or credit card?
- Big cash.

144
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,172
- Thanks a lot.
- OK, come on in.

145
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,010
Hey, stop that.

146
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,973
- I'm starving.
- We need champagne.

147
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,648
Diana, can you get your father?

148
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,533
- Have you seen my father?
- No.

149
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,857
- Diana, Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

150
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:27,373
- Excuse me. Where's Daddy?
- In there, wrestling with Burt Tuck.

151
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:32,335
...not the doctors...
- Burt, you're wrong. You're full of shit.

152
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:38,217
The AMA has got to realise people
don't give a rat's ass about that,

153
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,571
when a simple appendectomy
costs $6,000.

154
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:47,969
Where does it say Congress answers
to the AMA and not to their electorate?

155
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,976
- I'm sorry I interrupted.
- It's all right. Go on.

156
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,220
People don't want
AMA deciding on health

157
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,537
any more than Exxon
running the Interior Department.

158
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:06,052
You ever been
on an AMA golf outing, son?

159
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,457
- No, Senator.
- Well, take Dr Tuck here.

160
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,050
He'll fix your bursitis,
sharpen up your short game,

161
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,616
wipe out your campaign debt
before you're off the first green.

162
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,412
Yes, Senator.

163
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,018
You're right. You're there to represent
the people who elected you.

164
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:30,533
But to do that you've got to get elected,
and that takes money.

165
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,619
So, every day you try to remember
where you drew the line.

166
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:39,814
- What's your name?
- Peter Burton. I'm at UVA with Tim.

167
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,252
- Nice to meet you, Peter.
- It's an honour.

168
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,372
Now that you've given me indigestion,
Burt, let's eat.

169
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,533
Finally! I'm starving.

170
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,978
You did fine. I'm John Lawry.
I'm an aide to the senator.

171
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:06,731
Peter Burton. I was just reading
your profile in the <i>Washingtonian.</i>

172
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,569
- Just?
- Just recently.

173
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,136
The article was in
a year and a half ago.

174
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,138
Some stack in the library.

175
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,776
You prepare for everything
the way you prepare for parties?

176
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,938
John, let's get something to eat.

177
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,853
Could you pass these around?

178
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,097
Peter! A special hat for you.
Looks good.

179
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,734
- Bathroom's there.
- Just wanted to get out of the crowd.

180
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,896
Have you seen Tim?

181
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,695
Deep into it with some guy from Justice.

182
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,332
That's not "some guy".
That's the Deputy Attorney General.

183
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:19,936
It's like the <i>National Review</i>
come to life in there.

184
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,255
And are you impressed by that?

185
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,816
Yes, I am.

186
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,808
- How was London?
- Oh, great. Fantastic.

187
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,729
- You went to school there?
- I've still got lots of friends there.

188
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,215
Shuttle them in for the party?

189
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,412
- You don't remind me of James Dean.
- What?

190
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,815
You remind Tim of James Dean.

191
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,693
If James Dean was a graduate grind.

192
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,859
Tim likes to make the basically boring
glamorous. No offence.

193
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,255
- None taken.
- There you are.

194
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,577
Give me the last kiss of '83.

195
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,570
I haven't seen that much log-rolling
since my father's poker games.

196
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,133
What's log-rolling?

197
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,856
Compromising the duties of office
under the guise of expediency.

198
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,733
Government by cheques and cocktails.

199
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:20,650
- A system that's worked for 200 years.
- I said nothing about your dad.

200
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,420
- Don't start.
- <i>One minute to go!</i>

201
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,169
- Resolutions?
- Find a good margarita in Georgetown.

202
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,336
- Cop out!
- You?

203
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,215
- Too young and powerless to mention.
- OK, next decade?

204
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,378
Prosecuting half the guest list.

205
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,094
To be in Congress within 10 years.

206
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,736
- That's it?
- But I mean it.

207
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,010
- Is this expensive?
- About $80.

208
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,495
I'll make a bet with you.

209
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,613
Election night '90. If I win,
you each owe me a bottle, by hand.

210
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,539
- If not?
- I'll bring you a case.

211
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,892
Just send mine. I won't want to be
around you the day after you lost.

212
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,694
Happy New Year!

213
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,730
Happy New Year, Pete.

214
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,578
Happy New Year!

215
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,450
My turn, Tim.

216
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,492
- What's wrong with this party?
- Who told you about it?

217
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,656
I smoked a joint with the caterer.

218
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:36,012
It's drug-induced? Can we drive
around for hours looking for a diner?

219
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,895
Usher in the New Year with adults
and you'll become one.

220
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,376
- Where is this joint?
- Over by Bridgeport.

221
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,053
- Here we are.
- This looks shitty.

222
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,899
- Let's go to Greenwich.
- It's worse.

223
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,093
- One drink.
- We won't stay long, I promise.

224
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,259
They've written "Party" three times
on the marquee. How bad can it be?

225
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,294
- They've clearly pulled out all the stops.
- OK, OK!

226
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,048
Two draughts, two shooters of Jack
and a Baileys.

227
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,057
- Jack?
- Yeah.

228
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:42,091
Browns for my friend.
No, Browns for my friend.

229
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,216
Petey Bertkowski?
Is that Petey Bertkowski?

230
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:52,052
Jesus! Out of my way!
Coming through! Out of my way!

231
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,970
Bertkowski! Petey Bertkowski! Jesus!

232
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,091
Todd!

233
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,771
- Short hair! It's been a long time.
- Yeah, a long time.

234
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,450
I saw your dad. I work for the city
and he worked with us.

235
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,572
A big snowstorm before Thanksgiving.

236
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,214
- We're just leaving.
- Seen Janine?

237
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:17,129
- I know she'll want to talk to you.
- Say hi to her...

238
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,138
<i>Baby! Janine, honey!</i>

239
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,649
<i>Baby! Janine!</i>

240
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:28,093
Come on! We're married now.
We got two kids and it's good.

241
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,894
Hey, Peter.

242
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:43,049
Hey, Janine. You look good.

243
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,692
You, too. Different.

244
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,292
Happy New Year.
It's good seeing you guys.

245
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,296
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

246
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,856
Happy New Year. Let's belly up here.
Couple of beers!

247
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,457
- Just don't judge me, OK?
- I don't even know your name.

248
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,976
Peter Michael Bertkowski.

249
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:58,260
Born, New Haven, March 91959,
to Mike and Irene.

250
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,294
The mother left when he was ten.
The father, a Cutty Sark fan,

251
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,856
raised the boy, working sporadically
around the holidays.

252
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,893
People got the charitable urge.

253
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,090
Where were you Christmas?

254
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,456
School.

255
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:21,132
- Why did you lie to me?
- I thought you wouldn't be my friend.

256
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:26,414
Why would you think that
I'd give a shit about stuff like that?

257
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,738
Most people don't see the world
with the same eyes you do.

258
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,138
They're not so sure who they are,
not so happy with who they are.

259
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,049
You don't have to lie to me.

260
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,658
- You don't understand, man.
- Why don't you let me try?

261
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,938
I'm sorry, Tim.

262
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,652
The thing is,
these personal traits of your father's,

263
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,569
some you can't stand,
these come out in you.

264
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,772
There's nothing you can do,
any more than you can

265
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,494
about getting his ears

266
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,656
or his hairline...

267
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,455
You know, last weekend, right.

268
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,096
Diana, little thing.
Dinner before the movie.

269
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:27,853
Turns into a fight, no other reason
than me sticking to a goddamn plan.

270
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,051
My father exactly.

271
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,570
How?

272
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,009
He ran his house the same way
he runs his courtroom:

273
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,178
Confusing stubbornness with strength.

274
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:49,419
I knew what she meant.
Got even madder denying it.

275
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,056
Do you have any idea
what I'm talking about?

276
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,250
But you don't have
to become your old man.

277
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,374
It's not inevitable.

278
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,458
Not if you fight it with everything you got.

279
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,289
- Hey, Tim. Timmy!
- Yeah?

280
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,809
- Mine came!
- You got it!

281
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,213
All right. OK, on three.

282
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,538
Good luck! One, two, three!

283
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:39,217
- OK. "Department of Justice..."
- "After a considerable number..."

284
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:44,335
- "inform you of your acceptance..."!
- "...staff of Senator James B Stiles"!

285
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,133
Washington!

286
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,968
Yes. Look around. Here we are.

287
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,616
A lady writes, "Dear Senator,
My Oscar is a great admirer of yours,

288
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,893
"and every time you come on the TV
he sits in front to watch.

289
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,810
"And when they applaud your speech
he barks right along."

290
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,658
Oscar's her fucking dog!

291
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,930
Now, "Oscar has been sick.

292
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:48,089
"Could the senator find time
to have a photograph taken with him?

293
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,133
"It would mean so much, you know."

294
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,972
Don't everybody look at once.

295
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:12,252
Senator Frank Steubens with
an unidentified blonde. Laminated.

296
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,337
Jesus!

297
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,418
- Jesus!
- She's a lobbyist.

298
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,976
America's family man toasted
with a blonde at Wah Fong's.

299
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,378
I like the papers on the table.
Nice touch. Working dinner.

300
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,538
They're drawing up a proposal
introducing his member

301
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,174
into her historic chamber.

302
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,258
- You wished you'd said it.
- All right.

303
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:40,056
I wish Stiles was here. We got a bill
Steubens' committee's been blocking.

304
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:45,254
I'd love to see the senator march over
and lobby him with Blondie sitting there.

305
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,499
Why don't you do it? You're the real
brains in Stiles's office.

306
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,817
We know it, but Steubens doesn't yet.

307
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,330
- Take a vacation!
- Drink your drink!

308
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,451
Get him out of here.

309
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,818
Taxi!

310
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:11,299
We're going to Ronnie and Nancy's.
Want to come?

311
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,252
- Bye.
- Goodnight.

312
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:23,410
Kentucky plates. Russell Building
parking sticker. Steubens' car.

313
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,659
Wow! Now I've seen it all.
Can we go now?

314
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,250
- Get the jack out of the trunk.
- What for?

315
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,611
Peter, what the fuck are you doing?

316
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,334
Oh, no!

317
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,614
Yeah, they got me, too.

318
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,409
Senator Steubens?

319
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,378
Tim, it's Senator Steubens.

320
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,573
Senator, I'm a great,
great admirer of yours.

321
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,819
Oh, very nice to meet you, sir.
Miss Winston.

322
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,090
- Peter.
- Hi.

323
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,212
Must be a Democratic precinct.

324
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,290
Let me change your tyre.

325
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,651
Oh, no, I couldn't ask you to do that.

326
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,658
- Just take my car.
- I couldn't.

327
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,533
I'm an aide to Senator Stiles.

328
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,332
Stiles?

329
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,691
Good people, Stiles. Good people.

330
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,098
I could just run up to your office
tomorrow, exchange keys.

331
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,098
It would be an honour, Senator.

332
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,860
- I don't know...
- Let's accept.

333
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,255
You think so, honey?

334
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,212
OK. Thank you.

335
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:35,494
Just let me have a word with our
good friend here. Hold that, honey.

336
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,498
- Nice meeting you.
- You, too.

337
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,694
- Peter Burton, Senator.
- Just call me Frank, Pete.

338
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:50,049
- I know what this looks like.
- Like a senator working late.

339
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,889
I know what it looks like.
Don't yank my chain.

340
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,331
- No, Frank.
- Just between us men.

341
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:01,852
- Can't stress the importance.
- No need, Frank.

342
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,971
Thank you.

343
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,091
Pete.

344
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,292
Thank you again. Come on, honey.

345
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,616
Senator.

346
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,456
- Thank you.
- Goodnight.

347
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,817
Frank, hurry.

348
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,137
- The moves on this kid!
- You stuck his tyre. That's a crime.

349
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,093
OK, so I created a situation.

350
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,259
So what? I did him a favour,
equals Stiles did him a favour.

351
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,214
So he's on our dance card in
a close vote. What's wrong?

352
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,819
It's wrong.

353
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:04,499
You think the Department of Justice
never cuts corners? It's a new day.

354
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,978
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Don't get caught.

355
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:19,133
Lighten up.
I didn't break into Watergate.

356
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:23,697
I let the air out of a tyre. It's kids' stuff.

357
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,978
Baker's moving to excuse Standish,

358
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:39,014
so we've got to get into his involvement
with the pipeline contracts.

359
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,609
Hammer Standish
when he twists his watch.

360
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,048
What?

361
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,935
Every time he takes the Fifth
or "can't recall", he twists it.

362
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:52,498
Like those Lebanese lobbying answers.
He twists his watch, come down hard.

363
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,577
Hey, Pete.

364
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,295
- Your boss is writing "kick me" on this.
- Afternoon, Frank.

365
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,253
- You know Peter?
- Met last night.

366
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:07,614
We had a nice chat about your
amendment to the Appropriations Bill.

367
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:12,689
Listen, Jim. Walk back with me
after the hearing. I think we can talk.

368
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,095
See you inside.

369
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,892
Yeah.

370
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:30,013
- Will you tell me what that was about?
- No time. We'd better get inside.

371
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:47,012
I told Mrs Santana we'd be out
of the apartment Monday morning.

372
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:51,008
- Did she rent it?
- I don't know. Why?

373
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:56,176
I'm staying, Tim.
I'm not going back to school.

374
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:01,135
- You're kidding?
- No. We're in the best school there is.

375
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,059
College of Ways and Means, DC.

376
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,012
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

377
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,176
- Take 'em.
- Good shot!

378
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,448
- Are you sure it's OK?
- Yes, I was nodding off, too.

379
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,651
Dinner's not for an hour,
so we can walk...

380
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,852
Or just get a bite. No, I'm not hungry!

381
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,858
- I'm getting fat anyway.
- You are not!

382
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:34,530
- Maybe if we walked I'd be hungry.
- It's OK.

383
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,291
I'm sorry. You put this big night
together and I'm being a creep.

384
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,856
- What's the matter?
- We're about to be separated again.

385
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,609
And I'm thinking maybe
that's not such a bad thing.

386
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:50,335
- What?
- I don't know where it's going.

387
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,134
It's going fine. What is this?

388
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:58,095
Just because you say it's fine,
doesn't make it fine.

389
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,892
OK.

390
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,451
OK.

391
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,772
I'm listening.

392
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,852
Well...

393
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,939
Why are you so set on Justice?
Isn't there another track?

394
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:23,055
- Why be out of the loop?
- Ass-kiss your way to the middle?

395
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,094
That's not what it is.
My parents have a wonderful life in it.

396
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,578
- You're one of the best.
- You think the DOJ is for rejects?

397
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,975
No, I'm not saying that.

398
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,297
I don't want to spend my life
trying to get votes.

399
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:44,338
If you're happy with your programme,
fine. But it's not mine, or ours.

400
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:48,613
I can't say I'd be happy
being basically a cop's wife.

401
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,097
Not a cop, an attorney.

402
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,893
No one said anything about marriage.

403
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,734
I hate the way I sound,
but I have to say these things.

404
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:11,216
We have to think about them.

405
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,049
So, I'll call you when I'm in town next.

406
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,094
I didn't mean to hurt you. I love you.

407
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,370
Let's get out of here.

408
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,815
I'm going to the bathroom.
Wait for me, OK?

409
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,738
Yeah.

410
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:53,011
- I knew it was no before I could ask.
- Did she give you a reason?

411
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:58,931
My career plans aren't glamorous
enough. It seems like that matters.

412
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,497
- What will you do?
- Try and fall out of love with her.

413
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,168
She loves you. It's obvious.

414
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:12,137
If she loses you over some agenda,
then she doesn't deserve you.

415
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:15,537
- Am I right?
- Peter.

416
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,130
- Could I speak with you?
- Certainly, John.

417
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,898
- Hi, Tim.
- Hi.

418
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,854
- What's up?
- I just came from Steubens' office.

419
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:31,697
- Is he behaving himself?
- Maybe you want to talk in private.

420
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,568
Tim's my brother.
He's going to hear it anyway.

421
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,010
Here it is.

422
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:48,173
Don't you ever, ever go trying to make
some deal for the senator's office.

423
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:52,168
You want to play maverick,
take it somewhere else.

424
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,895
If you're staying,
you go through channels.

425
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,489
Got me?

426
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,168
- Got you.
- Good.

427
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:05,976
The campaign staff in Connecticut
is spread too thin. We need a hand.

428
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,172
Take the shuttle to New York,
then the train to New Haven.

429
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,817
- Someone will pick you up.
- Decoration committee?

430
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:18,138
- Fundamentals. Something you missed.
- Ask you one thing?

431
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:22,128
- Quickly.
- Is Steubens with the amendment?

432
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,013
- That's not the point.
- I know.

433
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,211
I don't think you do.

434
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,493
Yes.

435
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,296
He's fucking with me. It's personal.

436
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:52,934
Now I have to find a way round him.
Shouldn't be too hard.

437
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,608
40 years old and he's still an aide.

438
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:00,177
Dresses like a leftover campus radical.
John Denver-looking motherf...

439
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,020
Thank you. Thank you very much.

440
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:09,012
Lyndon Johnson once told me
that a good speech

441
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:13,418
is measured by how quickly
it gets the audience on its feet.

442
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:18,171
So, the owner of the black Mercedes
with Connecticut plates,

443
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,292
your lights are on.

444
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,774
Sorry about that.

445
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,576
Not staying for the rest of the speech?

446
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:40,296
No. I just wanted to see
how my joke went over.

447
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,492
Been here since eight in the morning.
Goodnight.

448
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,732
Where are you going?

449
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:54,890
I'm going to sneak over that fence,
take off my clothes and float in that pool.

450
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,012
I'd ask you, but I hate hearing no.

451
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:01,371
How do you know I'd say no?

452
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:10,096
'Cause I don't think those looks
you've been dealing me

453
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,576
add up to you actually doing anything.

454
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:21,733
I think you're a daddy's girl. And
she doesn't fool around with the help.

455
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:25,933
- Got me all figured out, huh?
- Tell me I'm wrong.

456
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,656
You're wrong.

457
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,172
- What about Tim?
- What about Tim?

458
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:46,498
- What are we going to tell him?
- Nothing.

459
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,134
We were both curious.

460
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:54,892
You've been in my bed every night
this week. That's more than curious.

461
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:59,013
This doesn't have anything
to do with Tim.

462
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,815
You going back with him?

463
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,580
Peter, I love Tim.

464
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:10,012
Whether or not I can be with him,
I don't know.

465
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,132
Whatever happens, you're not part of it.

466
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:17,299
You don't want to be.
You're his best friend.

467
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,814
What if you're what I want?

468
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:28,017
- What if I fall in love with you?
- God, no. No, no, no.

469
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:33,294
- This is screwed up enough as it is.
- I could.

470
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,537
You could fall in love with me, too.

471
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,494
- Stop it. I don't think so.
- Why? I'm not good enough?

472
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:45,376
- Come on, Peter.
- Just say that you could love me.

473
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,731
- No.
- Just say it.

474
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,056
Just say it.

475
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,135
No!

476
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,693
They pay peanuts with 2 weeks a year?

477
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,859
- I just started. It gets better.
- I know waiters with better deals.

478
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,651
- Who'd you say your friend was?
- John Palmeri.

479
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,739
A developer. Took a big initiative
for Stiles last election.

480
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,578
A big initiative?

481
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:29,570
- A lot of cash and kicked labour butt.
- Did you let him borrow your car?

482
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,891
That's very funny.

483
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:38,174
He needed the senator's ear,
I was able to help and here we are.

484
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:44,130
I'm not an intern any more. I got
my own relationship with the senator.

485
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,013
Chief Administrative Aide. Thank you.

486
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:52,377
- You're right on schedule, aren't you?
- First vacation in two years.

487
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:56,050
- I'll beat you skiing, too.
- I don't ski on the bunny slopes.

488
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:59,536
- Think I need a lesson?
- Three or four.

489
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,450
You don't have to decide now.

490
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:07,413
- If you get tired slogging...
- Slogging?

491
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:11,454
Turtling... I got you a slot with Stiles.
Me and you together.

492
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,379
- Me under you?
- No, I show you the ropes.

493
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:17,936
In a week, you'll be writing laws,
not looking them up.

494
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,210
- Enforcing them.
- Try it.

495
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:24,208
- Why do you want me there?
- For the future.

496
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,651
For when I make the run.
I don't kid myself.

497
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:32,650
I'm Mr Shine. Give me a baby to kiss
and a filmmaker to shoot it, I'll be in.

498
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,170
- I'll need my legal eagle.
- I like what I do.

499
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:40,692
Somebody hurts someone,
steals from them, I can right it.

500
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:44,415
- That's very liberating.
- Why are you so naive?

501
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:48,738
- Your Washington is not mine.
- You're wrong, man.

502
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,977
It's all the same ball game.
Even at Justice.

503
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,451
You need to realise that.

504
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:59,619
If you're that good,
you'll have plenty of men to pick from.

505
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:05,452
If I can ever help from where I am,
all you've got to do is ask. All right?

506
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:17,456
- Last run.
- Damn, did we do this week up!

507
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,651
Yeah, we did.

508
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,698
God, look at that.

509
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,530
Listen, Tim, I've got to talk to you
about something.

510
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:36,530
About seeing somebody.
I haven't been straight.

511
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,298
I haven't...

512
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,575
Diana. I've been with Diana.

513
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:53,460
After you went back to school, I was
around her, around the campaign.

514
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:59,058
- It's been on and off for a year.
- And now?

515
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:06,851
- I'm going to ask her to marry me.
- That's your relationship with Stiles?

516
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:10,132
- Don't think that.
- What am I supposed to think?

517
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:13,059
It just happened.

518
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:30,854
I'm taking this. If you want an easier
run, I'll meet you at the bottom.

519
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:38,815
- Last run. We've got to ski it together.
- It's up to you. Follow if you want.

520
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,657
Shit!

521
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:48,412
Pete, stop! No! Stop! Just fall over!

522
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:59,292
Ski patrol! Ski patrol!

523
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,418
- Don't move.
- My fucking leg!

524
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:16,180
Ski patrol's on its way.

525
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:21,817
I didn't hear you soon enough.
I know you were yelling.

526
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:25,695
- I'm sorry.
- I couldn't hear. I know you were there.

527
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:29,653
I know you meant to warn me.

528
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:34,217
- I know you were trying to help.
- I'm sorry.

529
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,455
Ski patrol!

530
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:44,451
You know with Diana I never meant
to hurt you. You know that?

531
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:47,333
- Right?
- Yes.

532
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:50,100
Ski patrol!

533
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,979
Oh, fuck!

534
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,452
Don't move.

535
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,815
Be my best man.

536
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:09,291
- Good?
- Yes.

537
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,930
<i>So I was absolved</i>
<i>of trying to kill my best friend.</i>

538
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,096
<i>And he was acquitted</i>

539
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,451
<i>of snaking the only girl</i>
<i>that really mattered to me.</i>

540
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:24,859
<i>Even frozen and in shock,</i>
<i>one leg mangled and two ribs cracked,</i>

541
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:28,814
<i>Peter Burton</i>
<i>could cut himself a deal.</i>

542
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:33,210
Louise, that's crazy.

543
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:38,972
We could hold fundraisers forever.
It wouldn't make up for that kind of cut.

544
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:43,093
Don't do this! You pull out on this vote
and I'm screwed!

545
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:47,976
- Hold on. Diana.
- One minute. Could you hold on?

546
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:52,970
- Warrilow's told Peckheiser to vote no.
- Dick's cutting Meals for Millions.

547
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,977
- Do I care?
- David!

548
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,814
Louise, hi, Peter. And to you.

549
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,773
Don't tell me he feels terrible.

550
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:04,814
He's going to look terrible
if Diana's forced to fight him.

551
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,772
- OK. Louise.
- David.

552
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:10,609
Yes, isn't he? I'm back in a week.
Hold him until then.

553
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,210
I'll get my father involved
and we'll figure it out.

554
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:19,494
You're a saint. Great.
Love to the kids. Bye. Yes!

555
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,339
And this must be Palmeri Bay.

556
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:28,089
Officially it's still Long Island Sound,
but we're working on it!

557
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:31,292
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.

558
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,209
I'm glad you like it. It's yours.

559
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:39,299
- That was easy. Let's look at Porsches.
- I'm serious.

560
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:43,459
I know you're going to love it here.
Especially you, Diana.

561
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,857
- Thank you, but...
- But nothing.

562
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:51,053
I'm looking forward at a man
who's going to be my Congressman.

563
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:54,218
He needs to establish
residency in this district.

564
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:58,538
- I couldn't afford this place.
- Your campaign fund can.

565
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:03,533
- What campaign fund?
- The exploratory money I'm raising.

566
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:08,018
A portion will be allocated for housing
and office space. This is it.

567
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:14,177
- Too good to be true?
- There's nothing unethical about it.

568
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:17,929
If that's what you're worried about.
This is done a lot.

569
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:22,338
- I didn't know that.
- You live, you learn.

570
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:28,096
- Diana, I want to show you the rest.
- Sure.

571
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:32,054
This is the master bedroom.
Most rooms face the water...

572
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:37,813
If you're not comfortable with it,
just hand those keys back.

573
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:42,888
The important thing is
I want to help you, work with you.

574
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:48,379
- Any time you're uncomfortable, say no.
- Any time, on anything?

575
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,932
Absolutely.

576
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:08,650
We're bidding for a federally-funded
low-income project for Bridgeport.

577
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:13,376
It's a fair bid and we want the job,
but we've got competition.

578
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:17,095
- You said you've a friend at Justice.
- A good buddy.

579
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:20,656
- I don't trust him.
- That's prejudice.

580
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,259
No, instinct.

581
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,770
- If his name was Winthrop...
- That's prejudice!

582
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:29,939
- He's a respected businessman.
- He's a silk suit with tax scams.

583
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:34,099
You don't trust him because
he fought to get where he is.

584
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:39,852
- He sees something in me.
- So do I, Peter. I married you.

585
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:45,851
Quit trying to tear me down. I'm just
trying to get us where we want to be.

586
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,449
- Unbelievable.
- Congratulations.

587
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,697
- Take care. Bye.
- See you later.

588
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:57,458
- Are others as guilty as Wagstaff?
- Did you think they'd convict?

589
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:01,016
Are you satisfied
Wagstaff's as high as it went?

590
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:05,611
I can't answer questions because
of the appeal. I have a statement.

591
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:09,699
Wagstaff's conviction is not only proof
that the system works,

592
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,653
but that it can work across the board.

593
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:16,011
No matter how high up,
you're still accountable.

594
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:20,816
I thank the jury, local prosecutors
and everyone who came forward.

595
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:24,774
I've a message to the <i>Orlando Sentinel:</i>
Garrity, two Rs and a Y.

596
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:35,379
- What are you doing here?
- Taking Dick Tracy to the Super Bowl.

597
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:42,019
- 623. We're here on the left.
- This is great!

598
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:46,338
- He promised me the 50-yard line.
- Where'd you get the tickets?

599
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:49,771
Business Round Table.
The NRA's got a sky-box.

600
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,052
Maybe we can hang around there
the second half.

601
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:57,219
Why are you wasting the Super Bowl
on a lowly DOJ attorney?

602
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:01,254
Maybe I did waste them.
Fuck you. I never see you now.

603
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:05,578
I'm sorry. It's this weekend.
Everybody's brown-nosing.

604
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:09,250
I feel like the third wheel
on your date with destiny.

605
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,690
<i>Rise for our National Anthem.</i>

606
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:17,338
- If a guy promises the 50-yard line...
- All right. It's the <i>Banner.</i>

607
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:20,896
<i>What so proudly we hailed...</i>

608
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:26,171
You've been buying drinks
all weekend for the State of Florida.

609
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:29,929
Log-rolling. Yeah, I know.
Meet Senator Lackerby.

610
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,370
I don't know.

611
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:35,492
Just take a bow. Not for me, for you.

612
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:39,978
- You don't understand.
- I understand plenty. Come with me.

613
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:43,377
Excuse me. Coming through. Senator.

614
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:49,212
- Peter Burton. Senator Stiles' office.
- Of course. Welcome to Florida.

615
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:52,332
Thank you. Meet a friend of mine.

616
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:56,499
Meet the man
who put Sandy Wagstaff behind bars,

617
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:00,978
Deputy US Attorney, Tim Garrity.
Tim Garrity, Senator Lackerby.

618
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:05,856
Sandy Wagstaff stands
for progress in this state.

619
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:10,417
I don't care what peccadilloes
your witch-hunt has scared up,

620
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:14,329
it is not justice when
a Sandy Wagstaff goes to prison.

621
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:20,092
The Department of Justice, the FBI,
Dade County prosecutors, a jury

622
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,815
and some of your own staff
would disagree with you.

623
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:29,014
If you have a problem, take it up
with them. I'm only here for the beer.

624
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,892
Excuse me.

625
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,977
Did you have to?

626
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,296
- Should I apologise?
- He's a senator.

627
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:39,652
He's a crook. We could've
indicted him and got orders not to.

628
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:43,216
You're right and
we go back to the lousy seats.

629
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,888
- I'm kidding.
- It's hard to tell sometimes.

630
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:48,455
Will you look into something for me?

631
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,493
New Hampton Development.

632
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:55,534
It's similar to Wagstaff,
bribes from federally-funded projects.

633
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,812
It's on authority.
I told a constituent I'd speak to you.

634
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:21,616
- What did she say?
- Her father's tests came back.

635
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:25,608
- An early stage of Alzheimer's.
- Oh, my God!

636
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:30,139
Jesus, I'm sorry.

637
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:32,296
Yeah. Me, too.

638
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:38,132
- I never told you, OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

639
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:42,572
- He won't even tell his staff.
- How's Diana taking it?

640
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,137
You know, bad.

641
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,772
I mean,
the girl never left home anyway.

642
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:55,777
- Now it'll get worse.
- Don't look at it like that.

643
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:02,169
Since we married, I've been living
by this yardstick, James B Stiles.

644
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:06,658
- She married me.
- He's been nothing but good to you.

645
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:10,853
As long as I was a kid
hustling floor votes or money for him.

646
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:14,211
It's different since I married
his daughter. It is.

647
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:17,890
It's nothing overt, but I feel it.
I'm not one of them.

648
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:21,456
You're crazy.
They don't think like that.

649
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,174
But, Tim, it's true.

650
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:26,699
It is.

651
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,696
A knock. That's better.

652
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:41,929
Clean draft on the Armed Services
report. You're welcome.

653
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:44,973
Wait a minute. Shut the door.

654
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:55,978
I'm going to be leaving in a couple
of weeks. Taking some time off.

655
01:00:56,180 --> 01:01:00,332
I'm looking into running
for a seat in the fourth CD.

656
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:04,018
- Tinker isn't vacating.
- I'm anticipating it.

657
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:07,530
- Is Stiles backing you?
- I'm just exploring things.

658
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:12,814
The point is, the senator's going
to want me to realign the office staff,

659
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:17,616
and I'm going to recommend
against you taking over.

660
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:21,176
- I'm shocked.
- You think it's personal, but it isn't.

661
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:24,736
I think you're very good as an expediter.

662
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,090
Very valuable.

663
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:32,135
I'm not confident you'll focus on the real
business of this office. I'm sorry.

664
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:36,015
Don't be sorry, John. I'll be OK.

665
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:39,211
Thanks for the tip.

666
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:42,215
Oh, yes!

667
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:47,892
- You hit the shit out of that ball.
- You'd better stick to politics.

668
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:53,730
OK. Tinker's vacating a seat
in the fourth district.

669
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:55,931
- I want to run.
- Seriously?

670
01:01:56,140 --> 01:02:01,260
- I'd like to run with your support.
- Did you talk to Lawry?

671
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:05,453
- He's a manager, not a leader.
- He's got a terrific legislative mind.

672
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:10,654
- He deserves a chance to prove himself.
- Nobody'll vote for him.

673
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,691
I can do the job.

674
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:16,893
I need you on staff,
especially with John leaving.

675
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:21,378
- I'd be more use to you in the House.
- Leave that to me.

676
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:26,096
- Next term, we'll set you an agenda.
- I've got an agenda, sir.

677
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:29,417
I want to run in the next election.

678
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,612
A couple of terms
with you as my mentor,

679
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:36,256
and I hope to fill your seat
when you retire.

680
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:40,889
- Who said anything about retiring?
- Well...

681
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,534
I assumed with your illness...

682
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:49,768
Well, don't assume. They've assured me
the progression can take years.

683
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:54,656
That's great news!
Then, let's look at it long range.

684
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:59,411
An across-the-board ally
in the House for your final term.

685
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:03,374
And, more importantly,
someone to carry on your work.

686
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:07,292
I want to be that man, Senator.

687
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,298
What if I say no, Peter?

688
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:18,849
Then I have to seek support elsewhere.

689
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:21,813
Wouldn't that look strange?

690
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:26,810
Bringing his ammo into another camp.
People hear Alzheimer's, they worry.

691
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:32,333
- I don't want to think about that choice.
- Don't fuck with me!

692
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:35,691
I've been playing hardball
since before you were born.

693
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:41,293
I don't mind playing hardball.
I do mind being taken for a fool.

694
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:46,773
- Does Diana know?
- She's knows I'm seeking your support.

695
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:49,175
Which is all I'm doing.

696
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:52,019
What's your hurry, Peter?

697
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:57,931
- Got a new cure for this country's ills?
- No, not like that.

698
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:01,371
Only issue I saw you catch fire over
was where to eat

699
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:05,653
with those Gucci-assed lobbyists
you're so fond of.

700
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:10,092
So, what is it, boy? The money sucks.

701
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:14,452
Food tastes the same.
You still get a year older every birthday.

702
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:16,969
The future, Senator.

703
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:20,968
I want to contribute.
I feel my time is now.

704
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:24,494
You do, huh?

705
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:29,418
I'm not going to stand in your way.

706
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:34,819
My last term's too important to me
to take any chances with the election.

707
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:37,853
But let me tell you something.

708
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:45,291
You may win an election or two.
You may be able to live with yourself.

709
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:51,257
But God help you when the people
find out. They always do.

710
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:11,750
The time is now, John.
Tinker's not running for re-election.

711
01:05:11,957 --> 01:05:13,868
The seat's open.

712
01:05:15,477 --> 01:05:19,265
- Stiles'll back you?
- Yes.

713
01:05:19,477 --> 01:05:24,426
You'll need funding.
Organisation. More funding.

714
01:05:26,037 --> 01:05:30,428
- It's a lot of orchestrating.
- What could I do to expedite things?

715
01:05:32,037 --> 01:05:37,157
Give a couple of tugs. Deadline for
the Bridgeport project's coming up.

716
01:05:37,357 --> 01:05:43,876
If we got that contract 'cause of you,
my friends would be very impressed.

717
01:05:44,077 --> 01:05:49,071
My friend at Justice has been looking
into it, but he's coming up empty.

718
01:05:49,277 --> 01:05:53,190
He's sharp. He's not missing anything.
There's nothing there.

719
01:05:55,037 --> 01:05:56,311
Yeah.

720
01:05:57,357 --> 01:05:59,075
That's possible.

721
01:06:03,357 --> 01:06:07,669
You knew there was nothing
when you had me tip him.

722
01:06:08,637 --> 01:06:12,755
You're letting your line slack.
Look out. Give me that.

723
01:06:14,717 --> 01:06:17,550
I wanted you in a position to help us.

724
01:06:17,757 --> 01:06:19,110
How?

725
01:06:19,317 --> 01:06:22,275
There's a Justice Department
investigation.

726
01:06:22,477 --> 01:06:26,106
Reveal that, New Hampton's
out of the running. It's a big favour.

727
01:06:26,317 --> 01:06:30,356
- He's a friend. I can't set him up.
- He'd never know.

728
01:06:30,557 --> 01:06:34,835
What could happen? A little hot water.
Isn't that worth it?

729
01:06:35,037 --> 01:06:37,392
I can't do it.

730
01:06:41,717 --> 01:06:44,311
- Come on.
- I got it.

731
01:06:45,597 --> 01:06:48,430
Say I'm the Ghost of Christmas Future.

732
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:54,030
There you are. Diana, kids, nice fire.
You're counting blessings.

733
01:06:54,237 --> 01:06:57,513
What's making you runny inside?
Your achievements?

734
01:06:57,717 --> 01:07:00,595
A card from what's-his-name?

735
01:07:00,797 --> 01:07:06,508
"Warmest holiday wishes. We must
get together. It's been too long."

736
01:07:06,717 --> 01:07:11,154
I think I know the answer.
I just hope you do the right thing.

737
01:07:29,597 --> 01:07:32,794
<i>This is Sam Minot,</i> New Haven
Sentinel. <i>Is this Mr Garrity?</i>

738
01:07:32,997 --> 01:07:34,555
Yeah.

739
01:07:34,757 --> 01:07:40,150
I'm doing a story on your investigation
of the New Hampton Development.

740
01:07:40,357 --> 01:07:46,512
- This is just a threshold investigation.
- <i>It's an investigation, isn't it?</i>

741
01:07:46,717 --> 01:07:50,153
Well, yes, but...
Who are your sources?

742
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:55,067
- What's so funny?
- Oh, it's just a little ray of sunshine.

743
01:08:00,317 --> 01:08:04,674
- What were you thinking of?
- He called my direct line.

744
01:08:04,877 --> 01:08:07,675
I assumed he'd been cleared.

745
01:08:07,877 --> 01:08:11,756
You're a US attorney!
You don't assume anything!

746
01:08:11,957 --> 01:08:15,313
- No, sir.
- You were ambushed. Any idea why?

747
01:08:15,517 --> 01:08:19,112
No. My tip-off was
from an aide to Senator Stiles.

748
01:08:19,317 --> 01:08:22,036
He's coming up empty, too.

749
01:08:22,237 --> 01:08:26,355
- What's his name?
- Peter Burton. He's my best friend.

750
01:08:26,557 --> 01:08:30,835
Someone's got an agenda here,
and we're going to find out who.

751
01:08:31,037 --> 01:08:33,107
I'll have to offer you up.

752
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:37,549
I'm sorry, but you're suspended
until further notice.

753
01:08:37,757 --> 01:08:39,634
Yes, sir.

754
01:08:43,837 --> 01:08:45,350
Thank you.

755
01:08:47,357 --> 01:08:50,793
- Hello, handsome.
- Hello, beautiful.

756
01:08:51,997 --> 01:08:56,036
- Am I the first one here?
- You're the only one coming.

757
01:08:56,237 --> 01:08:59,468
- What the?
- Peter wanted us duded up.

758
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:03,067
- Thought you wouldn't do it.
- He's right. Where is he?

759
01:09:03,277 --> 01:09:05,791
On the phone. A drink?

760
01:09:05,997 --> 01:09:08,465
- Scotch.
- No ice.

761
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:10,429
No ice.

762
01:09:13,117 --> 01:09:15,312
The family crest.

763
01:09:16,077 --> 01:09:19,387
- Are you all right?
- No.

764
01:09:19,597 --> 01:09:24,113
- All my laundry's clean, though.
- They must know it's not your fault.

765
01:09:24,317 --> 01:09:27,627
How long are they
keeping you suspended?

766
01:09:27,837 --> 01:09:31,147
Until they can pin it
on somebody else.

767
01:09:34,357 --> 01:09:39,272
- You look good.
- You look good, too.

768
01:09:40,397 --> 01:09:42,274
What's the latest?

769
01:09:42,477 --> 01:09:45,355
I was set up by New Hampton's rival.

770
01:09:45,557 --> 01:09:48,196
- Like another developer?
- Yes.

771
01:09:50,637 --> 01:09:52,593
What do you think?

772
01:09:52,797 --> 01:09:57,746
I frisked Palmeri, if that's what you're
thinking. Diana's got a thing about him.

773
01:09:57,957 --> 01:10:02,553
You think I'm sitting on my hands?
Of course I checked John.

774
01:10:03,637 --> 01:10:08,188
- He had nothing to do with it.
- Justice will get to the bottom of it.

775
01:10:08,397 --> 01:10:11,548
They may doze, but they never close.

776
01:10:13,397 --> 01:10:16,673
Excuse me,
I've got to check on the lamb.

777
01:10:19,997 --> 01:10:22,795
We like it pink!

778
01:10:22,997 --> 01:10:27,434
You can always hang
around here for free grub. Say yes.

779
01:10:27,637 --> 01:10:28,956
Don't start.

780
01:10:29,157 --> 01:10:32,593
The fact is you're out of work.

781
01:10:32,797 --> 01:10:37,188
At least let me offer to help.
I'm announcing Monday.

782
01:10:38,717 --> 01:10:42,346
Come down.
Let me give you the lay of the land.

783
01:10:42,557 --> 01:10:47,028
Meet some people.
Tim, give me that much.

784
01:10:47,237 --> 01:10:50,195
I'll come watch your announcement.
That's it.

785
01:10:51,917 --> 01:10:54,477
We don't have to feed him now.

786
01:10:56,357 --> 01:11:01,477
- What are we covering today?
- Burton, announcing for Congress.

787
01:11:01,677 --> 01:11:04,589
Hope there's something to eat in there.

788
01:11:15,997 --> 01:11:18,955
The senator's cutting it close.

789
01:11:21,637 --> 01:11:24,947
I still think you ought to open
with a fart joke.

790
01:11:25,557 --> 01:11:28,674
- The senator is here.
- Mr Garrity.

791
01:11:28,877 --> 01:11:31,949
Here, Mr Burton. The senator's speech.

792
01:11:32,157 --> 01:11:33,954
Senator.

793
01:11:43,357 --> 01:11:46,190
There's only one sentence about Peter.

794
01:11:46,397 --> 01:11:50,834
- I said I'd introduce him, that's all.
- What's going on?

795
01:11:51,037 --> 01:11:53,346
- A misunderstanding.
- My ass!

796
01:11:53,557 --> 01:11:58,995
- What good is this going to do?
- What is he talking about?

797
01:11:59,197 --> 01:12:02,587
He said if I didn't back him,
he'd leak my illness.

798
01:12:02,797 --> 01:12:04,992
Not like that!

799
01:12:11,157 --> 01:12:14,832
- Are you saying he's lying?
- Sit down!

800
01:12:15,037 --> 01:12:19,315
He's got his version, I've got mine.
Side with your husband for once.

801
01:12:19,517 --> 01:12:23,351
You wanted this, too.
Did you think it would just come to us?

802
01:12:23,557 --> 01:12:25,434
I hate you!

803
01:12:26,757 --> 01:12:29,317
Diana, get back in here!

804
01:12:31,877 --> 01:12:36,473
I'm going out to introduce you,
and then our deal is done.

805
01:12:38,237 --> 01:12:43,516
And if you ever do anything
to hurt my daughter, I'll destroy you.

806
01:12:48,277 --> 01:12:51,189
- Gentlemen...
- We'll be right out.

807
01:12:51,997 --> 01:12:56,149
Now what do I do?
They're expecting the beautiful wife!

808
01:12:56,357 --> 01:12:59,713
- Hold on.
- I need a joke. She's nervous...

809
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:02,033
Did you blackmail him?

810
01:13:02,237 --> 01:13:05,229
I never threatened to use it. It's me!

811
01:13:05,437 --> 01:13:08,031
It's you. But it's not a tyre!

812
01:13:08,237 --> 01:13:12,355
- Don't start. I did nothing to you.
- We got to go.

813
01:13:47,357 --> 01:13:49,109
You were right.

814
01:13:49,317 --> 01:13:53,390
Burton was the source of the leak
of the investigation.

815
01:13:53,597 --> 01:13:57,306
We think he set you up
as a favour to John Palmeri.

816
01:13:57,517 --> 01:14:02,033
His associates got a federal project
by taking New Hampton out.

817
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:08,107
- Burton's had ties to him for years.
- He lives in one of Palmeri's houses.

818
01:14:08,317 --> 01:14:13,391
We believe his campaign is being
backed by Palmeri and his associates.

819
01:14:14,997 --> 01:14:18,114
- You're assuming nothing?
- It's all backed up.

820
01:14:18,317 --> 01:14:21,468
We've had an ongoing investigation
into Palmeri.

821
01:14:21,677 --> 01:14:26,307
He's tied into racketeering,
bribery and fraud in two states.

822
01:14:26,517 --> 01:14:28,428
- What now?
- Nothing.

823
01:14:28,637 --> 01:14:31,993
We've nothing solid enough
to go after Palmeri.

824
01:14:32,197 --> 01:14:37,555
As for your pal Burton, fucking you
over's not a federal offence.

825
01:14:38,597 --> 01:14:41,031
- Let me go after him.
- What?

826
01:14:41,237 --> 01:14:44,468
Let me work undercover
on Burton's campaign.

827
01:14:44,677 --> 01:14:47,396
I could gather evidence on Palmeri.

828
01:14:47,597 --> 01:14:51,476
If Burton's breaking the law,
we take it to Public Integrity.

829
01:14:51,677 --> 01:14:54,908
You're not FBI, you're a trial lawyer.
You're not equipped.

830
01:14:55,117 --> 01:14:57,392
He trusts me.

831
01:14:57,597 --> 01:15:02,671
You have somebody's trust, you've all
the equipment you need to nail them.

832
01:15:05,397 --> 01:15:08,594
Let me make some calls.

833
01:15:15,357 --> 01:15:19,066
- How you doing, Pete?
- Better now. Thank you.

834
01:15:19,277 --> 01:15:22,986
- I haven't done anything.
- Thanks for still having faith.

835
01:15:23,197 --> 01:15:27,349
- Where's the Mean Machine?
- Media guy said it looked flaky.

836
01:15:27,557 --> 01:15:29,309
How's this look?

837
01:15:29,517 --> 01:15:31,314
Responsible.

838
01:15:31,517 --> 01:15:34,031
- End of an era!
- Yeah.

839
01:15:37,277 --> 01:15:41,270
When I hear about tax breaks
for big corporations,

840
01:15:41,477 --> 01:15:44,037
I think, "Why give them a break?"

841
01:15:44,237 --> 01:15:47,866
But unless we attract
new business to this district

842
01:15:48,077 --> 01:15:52,707
and expand our tax base, there won't
be a new senior citizen centre,

843
01:15:52,917 --> 01:15:56,592
or meals-on-wheels
for your housebound friends...

844
01:15:58,437 --> 01:16:01,190
- John Palmeri?
- Yeah?

845
01:16:01,397 --> 01:16:04,912
- Tim Garrity. I'm with Peter.
- How'd you recognise me?

846
01:16:05,117 --> 01:16:06,709
Pete described you.

847
01:16:06,917 --> 01:16:10,387
And you're the only other person here
who can walk.

848
01:16:10,597 --> 01:16:13,236
- He looks good.
- Like a Kennedy.

849
01:16:13,437 --> 01:16:16,395
86 the notes. Get him to memorise.

850
01:16:16,597 --> 01:16:20,909
I keep telling him to.
I wanted to go over strategy with you.

851
01:16:21,117 --> 01:16:23,312
Sure. Get in.

852
01:16:26,877 --> 01:16:32,509
Now he's a candidate, everything goes
through me. Requests, advice, money.

853
01:16:32,717 --> 01:16:35,754
Sounds good. You ticklish?

854
01:16:35,957 --> 01:16:37,948
- What?
- Some guys are.

855
01:16:42,237 --> 01:16:44,626
Come on, let's go.

856
01:16:50,437 --> 01:16:52,393
- He's cherry.
- What?

857
01:16:52,597 --> 01:16:55,794
Careful is happy.
Didn't they teach you that at Justice?

858
01:16:55,997 --> 01:16:58,909
I'm out of there. I work for Peter now.

859
01:16:59,717 --> 01:17:04,029
You never know what's bred
in the bone. Accept my apologies.

860
01:17:04,237 --> 01:17:08,355
- Will you respect me in the morning?
- Speak to me.

861
01:17:14,277 --> 01:17:17,189
It's a crime that people live like that.

862
01:17:17,397 --> 01:17:22,676
I want to find the superintendent, the
landlords. I want some face-to-face now.

863
01:17:22,877 --> 01:17:25,232
How would you do that?

864
01:17:25,437 --> 01:17:28,713
- Can I steal him?
- Just a minute.

865
01:17:28,917 --> 01:17:33,035
Just found out one of Palmeri's
companies owns this property.

866
01:17:33,237 --> 01:17:36,593
- What?
- Back off on your speech.

867
01:17:36,797 --> 01:17:39,755
- What shall I say?
- Don't get specific.

868
01:17:39,957 --> 01:17:42,676
"Tomorrow's looking good."

869
01:17:57,117 --> 01:17:59,915
- How are you holding up?
- Fine.

870
01:18:00,117 --> 01:18:01,789
Yeah?

871
01:18:01,997 --> 01:18:05,876
You were pretty tight with Burton.
It's got to be rough.

872
01:18:06,877 --> 01:18:10,074
My old man said
that friendship is like the dew.

873
01:18:10,277 --> 01:18:14,907
It settles on some roses
and it settles on some dog shit.

874
01:18:15,117 --> 01:18:18,473
Record by pressing the first button.
It's also your mike.

875
01:18:18,677 --> 01:18:22,113
- There's a recorder in the shoulder.
- He has a scanner.

876
01:18:22,317 --> 01:18:25,070
Fibre optics. Doesn't register.

877
01:18:26,637 --> 01:18:28,593
Bond. James Bond.

878
01:18:32,197 --> 01:18:34,950
When's your meeting with Palmeri?

879
01:18:35,637 --> 01:18:40,427
- <i>Tomorrow afternoon.</i>
- <i>Want to go over it again?</i>

880
01:18:40,637 --> 01:18:42,707
- Mr Palmeri.
- This way.

881
01:18:42,917 --> 01:18:47,707
<i>Let him lead, keep it specific, persuade,</i>
<i>don't provoke, always be closing.</i>

882
01:18:47,917 --> 01:18:50,306
- Hey, Tim.
- How you doing?

883
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:54,112
<i>Are you sure</i>
<i>you haven't slipped anywhere?</i>

884
01:18:54,317 --> 01:18:56,706
<i>Nobody knows a thing.</i>

885
01:19:09,677 --> 01:19:13,272
If it's about playing wifey
at his debate, the answer's no.

886
01:19:13,477 --> 01:19:15,433
- Is that final?
- Yes.

887
01:19:16,477 --> 01:19:19,310
- OK.
- Damn it!

888
01:19:19,517 --> 01:19:22,190
That's why you came here, isn't it?

889
01:19:22,397 --> 01:19:26,072
Reconnaissance on his marriage.
That's really pathetic.

890
01:19:26,277 --> 01:19:30,987
- I said I'd talk to you, that's all.
- You did your job, you can go.

891
01:19:31,197 --> 01:19:35,793
No, you can go. I'm going to stay
and finish my drink.

892
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:41,234
I'm sorry.

893
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:50,069
- Want something?
- I'd love a double Stoly.

894
01:19:50,277 --> 01:19:53,428
- Double Stoly...
- No, club soda with lime.

895
01:19:53,637 --> 01:19:57,676
- What's that?
- A new trick I'm learning.

896
01:19:57,877 --> 01:20:02,553
Helps me see things for how they are,
instead of how I wish they were.

897
01:20:02,757 --> 01:20:05,590
What do you see?

898
01:20:05,797 --> 01:20:09,631
I see how Peter gets a hold on people.

899
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:16,267
He's so good at telling you
what you want to hear.

900
01:20:16,477 --> 01:20:20,152
How much we want to believe
everything he says.

901
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:24,953
- It's very powerful.
- It's not just Peter, that's politicians.

902
01:20:25,157 --> 01:20:29,150
Successful ones. You can't condemn
them. It's the nature of the beast.

903
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:31,917
- Don't condemn him?
- He broke no law.

904
01:20:32,117 --> 01:20:35,109
Any more than your father did
by letting him do it.

905
01:20:35,317 --> 01:20:40,311
It's a system that's worked
for over 200 years, remember?

906
01:20:40,517 --> 01:20:44,556
I think he had something to do
with setting you up.

907
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:47,271
He had nothing to do with that.

908
01:20:47,477 --> 01:20:52,597
What are you doing with him?
This isn't you, playing his game.

909
01:20:52,797 --> 01:20:54,708
I am sorry you got hurt.

910
01:20:54,917 --> 01:20:58,512
But just because
he wasn't your goddamn perfect man

911
01:20:58,717 --> 01:21:01,834
doesn't mean
I have to cut him off, too.

912
01:21:02,037 --> 01:21:05,871
I am helping out an old friend,
that is all.

913
01:21:11,517 --> 01:21:15,954
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't understand.

914
01:21:16,157 --> 01:21:18,193
You're right.

915
01:21:29,957 --> 01:21:32,790
Diana, be there on election night.

916
01:21:34,437 --> 01:21:40,114
Bring that bottle of champagne you
bet him, 'cause I think he might win.

917
01:21:41,637 --> 01:21:46,392
And bring a little faith in me.
You won't be disappointed.

918
01:21:49,837 --> 01:21:54,194
<i>Good evening and welcome</i>

919
01:21:55,997 --> 01:21:59,467

Well, 15 minutes.

928

Showtime!

929

<i>In that close race for the fourth</i>
<i>Congressional district, the Gold Coast,</i>

<i>Kevin McQuade and Peter Burton.</i>

931
01:22:48,477 --> 01:22:52,834

Come here!

934
01:23:07,037 --> 01:23:10,234
- Congratulations, Mrs Burton.
- Thank you.

935
01:23:13,717 --> 01:23:18,233
Come here! We fucking did it, man!

936
01:23:20,677 --> 01:23:22,349
It's great!

937
01:23:30,877 --> 01:23:33,107
Way to go, Pete!

938
01:23:33,317 --> 01:23:34,670
Pardon me.

939
01:23:38,517 --> 01:23:40,633
A bet's a bet.

940
01:23:42,077 --> 01:23:43,669
Congratulations.

941
01:23:46,477 --> 01:23:49,833
Listen, Diana,
maybe we can sort things out.

942
01:23:50,037 --> 01:23:52,232
No, Peter.

943
01:23:53,437 --> 01:23:55,393
I've filed for a divorce.

944
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:58,430
McQuade's on the phone.
He's ready to concede.

945
01:23:58,637 --> 01:24:00,593
In a minute. Diana.

946
01:24:00,797 --> 01:24:04,790
Go ahead. You've been waiting
for this moment your whole life.

947
01:24:04,997 --> 01:24:08,626
Don't start getting regretful.
It's not your style.

948
01:24:13,597 --> 01:24:16,748
Peter, come on. This is it!

949
01:24:16,957 --> 01:24:19,471
Kevin. Thank you.

950
01:24:22,477 --> 01:24:25,230
What was I supposed to have faith in?

951
01:24:25,437 --> 01:24:29,066
Sometimes the system works
and people are what you'd hoped.

952
01:24:29,277 --> 01:24:30,995
I've lost the faith.

953
01:24:31,197 --> 01:24:34,553
Did you know Peter
set me up, or just suspect?

954
01:24:34,757 --> 01:24:37,396
- What?
- Did Palmeri ask him?

955
01:24:37,597 --> 01:24:40,828
Or did he just offer me up?

956
01:24:41,037 --> 01:24:45,315
Oh, God. You've known all along.

957
01:24:45,517 --> 01:24:49,715
- Long enough to do something about it.
- Tonight?

958
01:24:49,917 --> 01:24:52,511
The fat lady's warming up.

959
01:24:55,317 --> 01:24:57,877
I'll see you down there.

960
01:24:59,557 --> 01:25:04,677
Peter's accepting in about 20 minutes.
We'll see you in the ballroom.

961
01:25:04,877 --> 01:25:08,233
- Everybody out. Give him some air.
- As your new Congressman,

962
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:11,793
I propose you all go downstairs
and get a drink.

963
01:25:18,197 --> 01:25:20,074
See you later.

964
01:25:20,277 --> 01:25:22,996
- See you down there.
- All right.

965
01:26:01,997 --> 01:26:04,557
Seven years, my friend.

966
01:26:04,757 --> 01:26:07,954
- Bet settled.
- Unbelievable.

967
01:26:08,157 --> 01:26:13,709
This stuff's a lot more expensive
than it was in 1983, I'll tell you that.

968
01:26:16,637 --> 01:26:21,347
We may not always get
what we want or what we need,

969
01:26:21,557 --> 01:26:24,549
just so's we don't get
what we deserve.

970
01:26:24,757 --> 01:26:28,113
- Congratulations, Congressman.
- Thanks, brother.

971
01:26:36,917 --> 01:26:41,069
No, no. Hey, I appreciate it, really.

972
01:26:42,237 --> 01:26:44,831
All right. Give me 15 minutes.

973
01:26:51,997 --> 01:26:56,832
- <i>Where the hell's Palmeri?</i>
- <i>I thought he'd watch his horse come in.</i>

974
01:26:57,037 --> 01:27:00,552
<i>He's going away. Maybe he's choosing</i>
<i>which 100 suits to take.</i>

975
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:04,432
<i>Shoes to match. What does he do</i>
<i>at his construction sites?</i>

976
01:27:04,637 --> 01:27:08,949
- <i>Do they vacuum before he arrives?</i>
- <i>That's if he ever arrives.</i>

977
01:27:10,037 --> 01:27:12,267
<i>Some piece of work.</i>

978
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:17,471
- <i>Please! You don't know the half of it.</i>
- <i>How much do you know?</i>

979
01:27:17,677 --> 01:27:22,546
More than you. He's got
a hammer-lock on a few union locals.

980
01:27:22,757 --> 01:27:25,908
You don't run a carting company
without John as partner.

981
01:27:26,117 --> 01:27:30,269
His wife's got a "catering service"
with half the state's hospitals.

982
01:27:30,477 --> 01:27:36,712
- Bitch wouldn't know Jell-O from steak.
- How do you do it? I'd be nervous.

983
01:27:36,917 --> 01:27:40,307
- We got an arrangement.
- Go along, get along?

984
01:27:40,517 --> 01:27:44,271
- He knows the parameters.
- What if he changes them?

985
01:27:44,477 --> 01:27:49,153
It won't happen. I'm not a puny
local official taking envelopes.

986
01:27:49,357 --> 01:27:54,715
- What do you mean?
- I'll tell you a story. Town supervisor,

987
01:27:54,917 --> 01:27:59,308
I forgot where, reneges on a variance
for one of John's developments.

988
01:27:59,517 --> 01:28:04,068
Comes home one night,
found his house burnt down.

989
01:28:05,557 --> 01:28:08,549
Didn't even let the dog out.

990
01:28:10,397 --> 01:28:12,911
Come on, let's drink up.

991
01:28:13,837 --> 01:28:16,670
I got a lot of people to thank.

992
01:28:22,037 --> 01:28:25,632
How did he get so much money
into the campaign?

993
01:28:25,837 --> 01:28:30,627
Holding companies, brothers-in-law,
friends. Man's got a lot of friends.

994
01:28:31,397 --> 01:28:33,627
And you owe them all?

995
01:28:36,997 --> 01:28:39,386
Yeah, I owe them all.

996
01:28:39,597 --> 01:28:43,112
Now I'm elected, I'll take care of them.
My time, my way.

997
01:28:44,437 --> 01:28:47,747
Just leave the dog with a neighbour.

998
01:28:50,917 --> 01:28:54,068
What do you owe them right now?

999
01:28:59,237 --> 01:29:03,116
- What is this?
- What's what?

1000
01:29:04,397 --> 01:29:06,627
All these questions about Palmeri?

1001
01:29:14,237 --> 01:29:18,389
What's with you
not looking me in the eye?

1002
01:29:32,637 --> 01:29:35,549
Palmeri's being arraigned right now.

1003
01:29:35,757 --> 01:29:40,035
They're gonna nail you for
accepting illegal kickbacks, conspiracy

1004
01:29:40,237 --> 01:29:42,193
and obstruction of justice.

1005
01:29:49,437 --> 01:29:52,315
You son of a bitch!

1006
01:29:52,517 --> 01:29:56,635
You set me up at Justice.
Why did you do that to me?

1007
01:29:56,837 --> 01:30:00,625
That's a lie.
I'll deny we ever had this conversation.

1008
01:30:00,837 --> 01:30:03,146
Yes, we did. Say "cheese".

1009
01:30:11,837 --> 01:30:16,672
Fuck you!
Come on, tell me about justice!

1010
01:30:19,357 --> 01:30:22,986
Tell me it has nothing to do
with me getting Diana.

1011
01:30:23,197 --> 01:30:26,587
Tell me this isn't about me
coming out ahead of you.

1012
01:30:26,797 --> 01:30:30,107
Get up, you self-righteous
son of a...

1013
01:30:44,957 --> 01:30:50,270
It's easy for you to screw people.
If everyone's out for you, then it's OK.

1014
01:30:50,957 --> 01:30:52,356
Garrity! FBI!

1015
01:30:52,557 --> 01:30:55,310
Get out!

1016
01:31:13,077 --> 01:31:15,796
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

1017
01:31:15,997 --> 01:31:18,750
- I had no choice.
- Course you did.

1018
01:31:18,957 --> 01:31:22,950
I got instinct and some moves.
Choice is for guys like you.

1019
01:31:23,157 --> 01:31:25,910
Diana married you.

1020
01:31:26,117 --> 01:31:30,395
You chose to make her regret it
with everything that you had.

1021
01:31:32,077 --> 01:31:37,071
Stiles took you under his wing
and you chose to blackmail him.

1022
01:31:37,277 --> 01:31:42,067
I was your friend
and you chose to betray me.

1023
01:31:48,477 --> 01:31:50,991
You did this to yourself.

1024
01:31:56,197 --> 01:31:57,755
Why?

1025
01:32:16,637 --> 01:32:22,507
I needed more than you could give,
you or Diana or any one person.

1026
01:32:27,597 --> 01:32:31,556
They say great men are embraced
by thousands of strangers.

1027
01:32:31,757 --> 01:32:33,987
I want to be great.

1028
01:32:36,317 --> 01:32:40,390
So you sacrificed a few
to reach the many.

1029
01:32:47,757 --> 01:32:50,510
They believe in me down there.

1030
01:32:50,757 --> 01:32:57,026
And you can't take that away.
They won't let you.

1031
01:33:35,037 --> 01:33:37,073
Thank you.

1032
01:33:37,277 --> 01:33:39,313
Thank you.

1033
01:33:39,517 --> 01:33:43,829
You know, for the past couple
of months, I've been saying

1034
01:33:44,077 --> 01:33:46,068
tomorrow's looking good.

1035
01:33:48,277 --> 01:33:51,474
I'll tell you a secret,
tonight's feeling great.

1036
01:33:53,757 --> 01:33:58,877
First of all, I want to thank
my campaign family.

1037
01:33:59,077 --> 01:34:05,073
Because of your fantastic dedication
and energy, we're here tonight.

1038
01:34:07,517 --> 01:34:12,227
With your hopes and dreams in our
hearts, we're going to Washington.

1039
01:34:16,637 --> 01:34:21,472
<i>In the past few months, as I've met</i>
<i>the fine people of this district,</i>

1040
01:34:21,677 --> 01:34:27,388
<i>I've come to think of you not just</i>
<i>as voters, but as family, as friends.</i>

1041
01:34:31,117 --> 01:34:33,870
<i>And that's how I want you to think of me.</i>

1042
01:34:34,077 --> 01:34:39,834
As your friend in Washington,
as your brother in Congress.

1043
01:34:40,037 --> 01:34:44,474
I'm listening,
and what's more, I hear you.

1044
01:35:20,637 --> 01:35:22,912
One of the questions

1045
01:35:24,117 --> 01:35:28,793
I've been asked, over and over again
during the campaign...

1046
01:35:31,397 --> 01:35:34,673
...is, "Peter Burton,

1047
01:35:34,877 --> 01:35:37,949
"why should I trust you?

1048
01:35:39,117 --> 01:35:42,712
"Why should I believe in you?"

1049
01:35:44,357 --> 01:35:46,871
It's a tough question.

1050
01:35:48,997 --> 01:35:54,071
The tough answer is because I'm not
afraid to admit that I'm human.

1051
01:35:56,637 --> 01:35:58,912
I'm one of you.

1052
01:36:00,437 --> 01:36:04,476
I'm motivated, I'm proud,

1053
01:36:04,677 --> 01:36:08,670
I'm competitive and, yeah,
sometimes I'm a little headstrong.

1054
01:36:08,877 --> 01:36:13,314
- Does that sound familiar?
- Yes!

1055
01:36:13,517 --> 01:36:16,873
I'm one of you.
And I'll tell you something.

1056
01:36:17,077 --> 01:36:19,796
Where there's an "Us" there's a "Them".

1057
01:36:19,997 --> 01:36:22,989
In smoky back rooms,
here in our district,

1058
01:36:23,197 --> 01:36:27,031
they're trading on our tomorrows
for their own gain.

1059
01:36:29,357 --> 01:36:31,951
In the past few months...

1060
01:36:34,557 --> 01:36:37,993
...one of these men invited me in,

1061
01:36:39,677 --> 01:36:42,430
and I let him think I was for sale.

1062
01:36:42,637 --> 01:36:45,356
Not Peter Burton!

1063
01:36:47,677 --> 01:36:51,067
As you'll soon find out,

1064
01:36:51,277 --> 01:36:53,233
I was so good at it

1065
01:36:53,437 --> 01:36:57,828
that some lawyers from Washington
really thought I was for sale.

1066
01:36:59,237 --> 01:37:01,910
That's the case they'll try to make.

1067
01:37:03,837 --> 01:37:08,672
I put it to you, was I too motivated?
Is it possible?

1068
01:37:08,877 --> 01:37:11,835
Too headstrong? Perhaps.

1069
01:37:14,077 --> 01:37:17,433
Less than circumspect? Definitely.

1070
01:37:20,717 --> 01:37:24,505
But I did what
any one of you would've done.

1071
01:37:25,677 --> 01:37:29,226
Tell it to the people
who can't find a home.

1072
01:37:31,157 --> 01:37:35,275
Tell it to the people
who can't find a decent job,

1073
01:37:36,637 --> 01:37:40,596
who can't send their children
to decent schools.

1074
01:37:47,957 --> 01:37:49,913
I did what you would've done.

1075
01:37:50,117 --> 01:37:55,430
I saw an opportunity to get a jump on
these guys, and I seized it.

1076
01:37:55,637 --> 01:38:00,995
I took that risk for one reason.
I took that risk for you.

1077
01:38:03,077 --> 01:38:05,671
We love you, Peter!

1078
01:38:12,997 --> 01:38:17,991
In the hopes that one day
I would be here with you at my side,

1079
01:38:18,197 --> 01:38:22,509
to take back our tomorrows from
these crooks and these schemers,

1080
01:38:22,717 --> 01:38:25,629
and to send a message to Washington

1081
01:38:25,837 --> 01:38:28,988
that we're in charge
and tomorrow's looking good!

1082
01:38:44,157 --> 01:38:46,671
<i>Garrity's on his way down.</i>

1083
01:38:47,837 --> 01:38:50,510
Here he comes.

1084
01:38:50,717 --> 01:38:52,947
A damn good job.

1085
01:38:57,077 --> 01:38:59,352
- Ready?
- He's in his suite.

1086
01:38:59,557 --> 01:39:04,028
Let him call his lawyer,
then bring him down the back way.

1087
01:39:07,637 --> 01:39:10,470
- Good work.
- Get enough?

1088
01:39:10,677 --> 01:39:14,829
- Plenty.
- Good. That's good.

1089
01:39:17,597 --> 01:39:20,350
- You OK?
- Fine. Wish he'd lost.

1090
01:39:20,557 --> 01:39:23,833
Spare him humiliation
on the front page.

1091
01:39:24,037 --> 01:39:28,349
Win or lose, he's front page. If not you,
it would've been somebody else.

1092
01:39:28,557 --> 01:39:30,866
But it is me.

1093
01:39:31,077 --> 01:39:34,865
He was my best friend
and I used that to fuck him.

1094
01:39:35,077 --> 01:39:38,114
Just like he did to you. You're even.

1095
01:39:38,317 --> 01:39:44,756
You signed on to Justice all full of fire
to set things right. And you're good.

1096
01:39:44,957 --> 01:39:50,270
But until tonight, it never cost you.
You don't own it until it costs you.

1097
01:39:51,557 --> 01:39:54,196
They're bringing him down.

1098
01:40:43,637 --> 01:40:46,754
If I lost,
I'd bring you a case of champagne.

1099
01:40:46,957 --> 01:40:53,226
Well, I got elected, but doesn't look
like I'm going to get sworn in.

1100
01:40:54,557 --> 01:40:57,390
So, there's the champagne. Bet settled.

1101
01:41:04,037 --> 01:41:07,109
I'm sorry it ended up like this.

1102
01:41:07,317 --> 01:41:11,754
- I second that.
- What are you going to do?

1103
01:41:12,677 --> 01:41:16,386
They offered me immunity
if I testify against Palmeri.

1104
01:41:16,597 --> 01:41:19,953
Nobody said anything
about immunity from Palmeri.

1105
01:41:20,157 --> 01:41:26,630
Or I can take my chances. I heard
you took yourself off the case. Thanks.

1106
01:41:26,837 --> 01:41:31,627
- No deal and I'll have to testify.
- I know.

1107
01:41:33,117 --> 01:41:36,792
- I've got to get going.
- Yeah.

1108
01:41:38,197 --> 01:41:42,952
But save a bottle of that champagne.
We'll make it an ongoing bet.

1109
01:41:44,637 --> 01:41:47,709
You know the old saying
in Washington.

1110
01:41:47,917 --> 01:41:51,592
Only two things can
truly wreck a man's political career:

1111
01:41:51,797 --> 01:41:55,472
Getting caught with a live boy
or a dead girl.

1112
01:41:59,517 --> 01:42:03,476
- Good luck, Pete.
- See you around campus, man.

1113
01:42:04,305 --> 01:42:10,932
