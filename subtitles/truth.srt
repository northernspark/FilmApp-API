1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,567
- What are they saying about Bush?
- Does he deserve reelection?

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,048
And here are the numbers.
Forty-five percent say yes...

3
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,442
49 percent say no.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,768
Democrats, 84 percent say no.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,201
Eighty-four percent of Republicans
say yes.

6
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,166
Independents, 51 percent now say
he does not deserve reelection.

7
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:25,045
- That's a red flag.
- And what about for John Kerry?

8
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:27,048
- Is that good news?
- It should be.

9
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,004
Look at John Kerry's numbers, Tom.
Positive-negative.

10
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:33,487
Positive 38 percent,
negative 38 percent.

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,926
This thing is still a toss-up.

13
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,088
Mr. Hibey will see you now.

14
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,564
Thank you.

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,682
Ms. Mapes.

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,966
I'm Dick Hibey. What can I do for you?

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,521
Oh, I think you know.

18
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,691
- You knit?
- You don't expect a woman like me...

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,611
- ...to knit?
- No. But it's good. It's helpful.

20
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,724
Yeah. You mean it blunts
my radical feminist agenda.

21
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:11,885
- Do you have a radical feminist agenda?
- You meet a lot of radical leaders?

22
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,040
Do you have a substance abuse problem?

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,804
I'm working on developing one.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,923
- I'm serious.
- Oh, so am I.

25
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,248
You came to me.
If you're not up for this...

26
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,921
I've been in news for 20 years.
Won two Emmys, broke Abu Ghraib...

27
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,045
done jail time for not revealing sources.
I have neither a feminist agenda...

28
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:32,368
nor a substance abuse problem.
Though I'm gonna take a Xanax...

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,722
because this is really freaking me out.

30
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,168
Got any water?

31
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,210
- Thanks.
- You have to be ready...

32
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:53,647
- ...for questions like that.
- I'm up for this.

33
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,680
There's an interesting recurring theme
to the stories you cover.

34
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,689
- People abusing their power.
- I don't like bullies.

35
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,850
Tell me about your work.

36
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,681
You wanna know if I'm responsible
for what happened.

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,650
- Aren't you?
- Look, I did my job. Believe me.

38
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,365
I don't have to believe you.

39
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,246
What matters is that they believe you.
Now, tell me about your work.

40
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,889
I'm the producer. I find the story.

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,602
I put the team together.
I write and cut the piece.

42
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,848
I work at 60 Minutes.

43
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,962
And what's that like?

44
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,882
Which one of you ordered the duck?

45
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,569
- That would be Tom.
- Napkin.

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,882
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Fatso.

47
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,408
- They're gonna run it this time?
- They're gonna run it.

48
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,247
- Because you said that last week.
- They're gonna run it, Roger.

49
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,800
Hey, you want me
to paint it out like this?

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,641
Oh, Jesus, no, it makes his genitals look
like they were attacked by mad cubists.

51
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,562
Maybe you could just
kind of darken the area.

52
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,330
Okay.

53
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,727
Like that?

54
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:10,084
Okay, now it just looks like
there's a black hole there.

55
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,086
- From which no light can escape.
- They're really gonna run it?

56
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,645
Because Sy Hersh has this...

57
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:18,884
and he's gonna write a story
about how we've sat on it.

58
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:23,085
Dana, can you tell Roger they're gonna
run it, then hit him for me, will you?

59
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,009
I gotta go grab him.

60
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,879
Can you finish it?

61
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,485
He was the first journalist to report
John F. Kennedy had been shot.

62
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,721
He described the Zapruder film in detail
to a nation...

63
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,009
that was not allowed to see it.

64
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,609
Became White House correspondent
at the age of 33...

65
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,167
chief London correspondent
a year later...

66
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,888
and brought the Vietnam War into
American living rooms for the first time.

67
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,284
He covered the Russians in Afghanistan,
the hostages in Iran...

68
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:59,280
and in 1981, became anchor
of the CBS Evening News.

69
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,925
He's now anchored
more nightly news broadcasts...

70
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,203
than anyone else in U.S. history.

71
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,167
That's not bad for the son of
a ditch-digger from Wharton, Texas.

72
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,606
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you my friend...

73
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,089
and the reason I have this job,
Dan Rather.

74
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,084
Long enough to give us
a great market share, I'll tell you.

75
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:33,807
- It's been a real pleasure. Real pleasure.
- Hey, Andrew, I need him.

76
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,805
- Well, you're not taking him.
- You say that, but here I am.

77
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,122
- You got him?
- In a hotel two blocks up.

78
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,045
- Let's go.
- Dan, you can't leave your own party.

79
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,846
- I got 50 affiliates and their wives...
- I know.

80
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,691
- ...waiting to talk with you. Goddamn it.
- I know.

81
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:51,771
- You wanna finish this off? I've had three.
- Mary.

82
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,286
I'll take that for you, Mr. Heyward.

83
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,846
You know?

84
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,283
General. This is Dan Rather.

85
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,882
- General.
- Sir.

86
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,242
Thank you for doing this.

87
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,529
Let's start from the beginning.

88
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,928
Americans did this to an Iraqi prisoner.

89
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,249
According to the Army,
the man was told to stand on a box...

90
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,324
his head covered with wires
attached to his hands.

91
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,526
He was told that if he fell off the box,
he would be electrocuted.

92
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,927
It was this picture
and dozens of others...

93
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,850
that prompted an investigation
by the U.S. Army.

94
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,326
Yesterday, we asked
General Mark Kimmitt...

95
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:51,284
deputy director
of coalition operations in Iraq...

96
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,605
what went wrong.

97
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,723
Every day we love our soldiers,
but frankly...

98
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,764
some days we're not always
proud of our soldiers.

99
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,286
The military says six American soldiers
have been charged so far...

100
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,766
and could be court-martialed.
Others higher...

101
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,571
in the chain of command
will likely be disciplined.

102
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,771
I remember when you used to say
"courage" at the end of every broadcast.

103
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,963
- You remember that?
- I remember. Do you remember?

104
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,685
You must be very old.

105
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,451
- Why'd you stop?
- They made fun of him, that's why.

106
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,170
- No.
- No, they did.

107
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,925
- Seriously. Imagine?
- Oh, yeah.

108
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,088
Go on, give us a "courage," Dan.

109
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,367
- No, come on. Mary.
- Come on, just one.

110
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,004
- For me.
- I don't think so.

111
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,288
- For me, for me.
- Come on.

112
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,970
Just a little one.

113
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,326
Cour...

114
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,130
- Come on, please.
- Come on.

115
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,279
- You really want it?
- I want it too, yeah.

116
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,084
Courage.

117
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,840
- Well, it worked at one time.
- It did. It did.

118
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,687
Hey. Here's to a great story.

119
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,723
Yeah, once they finally ran it.

120
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,000
- Yeah.
- F.E.A.

121
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,327
F.E.A.

122
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,451
We're sitting here with Mommy.
Thank you for being here.

123
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,411
No. Thank you for having me.

124
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,922
Mommy, you were away
for a long time again.

125
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,440
- What were you doing?
- I was in New York working on the news.

126
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,644
And what does that entail?

127
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,447
I was asking questions.
Questions help reporters get to the truth.

128
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,610
Were you with the men with the cameras?

129
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,040
Interesting.

130
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,284
- Can I have a new camera, please?
- We'll have to talk to your dad about that.

131
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,562
I'm trying to get to the truth here,
Mommy.

132
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,250
Answer the question.

133
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,887
I think this interview is over.

134
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,286
- Okay.
- Nice try.

135
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,521
President Bush said today he was
disgusted by pictures of Iraqi prisoners...

136
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,887
being abused by American soldiers.

137
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,048
Caused a bit of a ruckus, didn't you?

138
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:57,807
Who, me?
You didn't let Robbie watch it, did you?

139
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,646
Yes, because
I'm the worst parent of all time.

140
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:03,047
...and the damage to U.S. interests...

141
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,891
in the rest of the world
is hard to calculate, but....

142
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,600
- You wanna take a walk?
- Here's Martha Raddatz.

143
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,843
No, I think I have to work.

144
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:18,605
Mary, thanks for coming in.
Look, no big preamble.

145
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,644
We love you.
We love what you've done. It's...

146
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,082
Let's talk about the new season.
What are you thinking?

147
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,170
I might have something for the election.

148
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,564
There's this Houston businessman
named Bill White...

149
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,400
who claims that he has documents
that show the bin Laden family...

150
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,250
were investors in Arbusto.

151
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,841
Arbusto? Bush's oil company?

152
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,244
You know, could just be lots of sound
and fury, but Vanity Fair is into it too.

153
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,524
You know,
that whole time period for Bush is funky.

154
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,767
Funky how?

155
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,128
Well, I did some work on it back in 2000.

156
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,567
- You know Ben Barnes?
- No.

157
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,847
Oh, he's an old Texas pol.

158
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,202
Barnes says when he was
the speaker of the Texas House...

159
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,322
in '68 during Vietnam...

160
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:04,484
Sid Adger, this big oilman,
comes into his office...

161
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,886
and asks for help getting George Bush...

162
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,287
into the National Guard as a pilot.

163
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,000
And Poppy Bush at this point
is a congressman...

164
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,567
and Barnes figures
he can use the connections.

165
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:19,368
So he says that he called General Rose,
who runs the Texas Air National Guard...

166
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,085
and gets Bush his slot.

167
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,086
Barnes told you this?

168
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,044
Off the record. He's been dining out
on the story for years.

169
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,004
I call Buck Staudt,
Bush's squadron commander...

170
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,489
and he starts screaming at me,
saying how Barnes is full of shit...

171
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,207
because everybody knows he's the one
who got Bush into the Guard, not Barnes.

172
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,121
Anyway, while Bush is in the Guard,
he meets this guy named James Bath.

173
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,923
And they become running buddies.

174
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,885
And after they get out, Bath,
with no résumé to speak of...

175
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,400
becomes
chief financial representative...

176
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,125
for the bin Laden family's interests
in Texas.

177
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,886
Bush starts up Arbusto,
Bath writes him a $50,000 check.

178
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,801
Which your guy, White,
claims is bin Laden money?

179
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,130
Okay. Okay, run it down.

180
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,166
But if we go with this, we gotta go early.
We can't October surprise them.

181
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,250
All right. If you're into this, I'd like
to bring in some other people to help.

182
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,965
Who?

183
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,730
Colonel Roger Charles.

184
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,683
Worked Abu Ghraib for us.
Naval Academy grad.

185
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:27,530
Two tours at Vietnam, then the Pentagon.

186
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,841
When he's not working for us, he's trying
to get better armor for troops in Iraq.

187
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,606
Who else?

188
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,600
Well, since Dana's on maternity leave,
I'd like Lucy Scott to run point.

189
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,282
She's a CBS veteran,
journalism professor in Dallas.

190
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,880
What about this man, Mike Smith?

191
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,411
Mikey cut his teeth working for Molly Ivins.
He was a researcher for us back in 2000.

192
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,206
Last I heard, he was a stringer
for People.com...

193
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,562
sneaking into parties
to find out who's sleeping with who.

194
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,725
Now, when you say "sport-fucking,"
he was just putting it to her for fun...

195
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:04,288
or he's like actively attempting
to compete at it?

196
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,642
It is a crack team.

197
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,443
Trust me.

198
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,606
You really gonna do it this time?

199
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,321
Your evil corporate overlords
will let you?

200
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,044
Good to see you too, Mikey.

201
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,806
CBS is talking
about closing foreign bureaus...

202
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,650
moving into more
of a bullshit infotainment direction.

203
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,490
They won't touch the news division,
as long as Dan's there.

204
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,287
Dan's not gonna be there forever.
They'll find a way to get the old man out.

205
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:40,169
Why did he even get into journalism
if he's not gonna do the tough stories?

206
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,446
How you doing, Mikey?

207
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,408
I'm eating ramen three meals a day...

208
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,606
stealing cable.

209
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,442
I could use a job.

210
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,524
Come in, meet everybody.

211
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,370
Well, hell's bells,
you brought me a hippy?

212
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,403
This is Mike Smith,
we worked on this together in 2000.

213
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,365
- He has no social graces whatsoever.
- That's true.

214
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:16,325
Your Arbusto tip, it's for shit.

215
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,522
Bin Laden money never got near Bush.

216
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,889
Okay.

217
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,286
What am I doing here?

218
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,639
What you're looking at
is George W. Bush's...

219
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,967
entire Texas Air National Guard file.

220
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,562
- You mean what's left of it, right?
- That's affirmative.

221
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,480
Wait, wait, wait.

222
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,679
You guys are doing a paper trail.

223
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:40,485
Let me show you what we've got.

224
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,046
It starts right here.

225
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,519
May, 1968.

226
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,721
Bloodiest month of the Vietnam War.

227
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:52,605
Bush is accepted into the Texas Air
National Guard for pilot training.

228
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,043
And if you believe Ben Barnes,
he got Bush onto the waiting list.

229
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,369
If there ever was a waiting list.
Some say yes, some say no.

230
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:02,643
Bush says he got in quickly
because they were looking for pilots...

231
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,923
which is bullshit with the pilots
rotating back in from Vietnam.

232
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,451
And that's another thing.

233
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,162
Training a National Guard pilot
from start to finish, that's a huge rarity.

234
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,202
- Why?
- It's not cost-effective.

235
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,845
Air National Guard jocks...

236
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,168
they're former Air Force pilots
who wanna maintain their ratings.

237
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,323
Why spend a million bucks
training some new pilot...

238
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,409
when you can get some guy
the Air Force taught how to fly.

239
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,241
Only thing that makes Bush an attractive
candidate is who he's connected to.

240
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,841
Well, either way, he's in.

241
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,686
He signs on for a six-year commitment.

242
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,722
He does his pilot training at Moody...

243
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,520
then he's assigned to the 111th
Fighter Intercept Squadron in Houston.

244
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,485
Now, the record shows
that he does really well here.

245
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,446
High marks at every rating period,
until the spring of 1972...

246
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:52,322
when he is suspended in writing
for missing a routine physical.

247
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:55,325
How does someone go
from being a top-notch pilot...

248
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,085
to not even taking a physical?

249
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,284
Well, not only that, but he requests
and he is granted...

250
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,730
a reassignment to Alabama where he
helps a friend on his senate campaign.

251
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:08,923
Wait, so he disobeys an order
and then they let him transfer?

252
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,923
Oh, hey, it gets better.

253
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,924
From May 1972 to May 1973...

254
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,609
the record shows there are no points
registered on Bush's record.

255
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,770
Points. They're like hours on a time card
in the Guard.

256
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,799
What it basically means
is that Bush never even showed up.

257
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,923
The Alabama commander,
he has no recollection of him.

258
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,407
No eyewitness can place him
on that base.

259
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,246
And there is no paperwork
to prove that he was ever there.

260
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,489
So you're telling me that
the president of the United States...

261
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,240
may have gone AWOL from the military
for over a year?

262
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,811
We have no proof of that.

263
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,202
- What does the White House say?
- That Bush served honorably...

264
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,687
and military records go missing
all the time.

265
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:55,769
Military records do not go missing
all the time.

266
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,803
They're the military.
They are good at shit.

267
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:04,080
Now, the next time Bush appears
on the official record is in July of 1973...

268
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,964
when he shows up for drills.

269
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,322
And then in September of 1973...

270
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,764
he requests and he is granted
an early discharge. Why?

271
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,283
So that he can attend
Harvard Business School.

272
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,205
So he asks to quit nine months early
and they just let him.

273
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,005
So, what are the questions
we're looking to answer?

274
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,328
One, did Bush go into the Guard
to avoid going to Vietnam?

275
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:32,649
Not to be cynical, but who didn't try to get
into the Guard to avoid 'Nam back then?

276
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,524
Me.

277
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:37,962
Bush's trainer in the 147th
said he wanted to go to Vietnam.

278
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,649
There's only one document
that deals with that in the official record.

279
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,368
On the question
of desiring overseas transfer...

280
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,966
Bush checked no.

281
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:52,049
Bush's trainer said
that must have been a mistake.

282
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,039
- Because that's a question you get wrong.
- Two, why did he skip his physical?

283
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,005
Well, it's not like he had a drug problem.
He just liked the way it smelled.

284
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,248
Okay, three.

285
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,724
If someone did get him into the Guard,
then who?

286
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:10,769
How the hell do we get them
to go on the record?

287
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,803
Forty-one percent say
they want Mr. Bush reelected...

288
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,764
while 51 percent don't.

289
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,366
Is it that time of year again already...

290
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:25,124
when I have to fend off the advances
of a beautiful woman such as yourself?

291
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,850
Governor, you got the president of the
United States into the National Guard.

292
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,169
I mean, my God,
I find that very impressive.

293
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,488
It is impressive, isn't it?

294
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,403
Come on TV, tell us all about it.

295
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,365
Oh, we both know if I ever said that...

296
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,207
about Texas' favorite son on camera,
I'd be run out of Austin on a rail.

297
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,168
No, sorry, Mary.

298
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,687
Johnny's gonna win this thing, anyway.

299
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,642
Barnes is still a no. Who's next?

300
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,124
Colonel Jerry Killian.
Bush's CO in the 111th.

301
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,561
If anyone will know what really went on,
he will.

302
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,046
Small problem there.

303
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,402
- Which is?
- Killian's dead.

304
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,211
- That's a pickle.
- Who's next?

305
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,526
General Buck Staudt.

306
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:16,287
Former CO
of Bush's 147th Interceptor Squadron.

307
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,767
George was one of the best pilots
I ever had.

308
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,567
So I'm gonna respectfully invite you
to go fuck yourself.

309
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,640
General Bobby Hodges...

310
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,605
succeeded Staudt as commander
of the 147th, Killian's direct supervisor.

311
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,883
My husband says
no strings were pulled for him.

312
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,367
Now, please stop calling our house.

313
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,961
Maurice Udell, Bush's flight instructor.

314
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,849
No strings were pulled for him.

315
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,242
I thought he'd be a great American
and a great fighter pilot.

316
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,371
Tom Honeycutt.

317
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,086
No strings were pulled.

318
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,880
Albert Lloyd.

319
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:56,527
- No strings were pulled.
- Motherf...

320
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,484
Bill Hollowell.

321
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,166
No strings were pulled.
And even if they were, it's a nonissue.

322
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:07,842
Hey! Hey! Move, you son of a bitch!

323
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:16,246
It was like they were given
talking points.

324
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,090
He was a great guy,
no strings were pulled.

325
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:22,767
Well, devil's advocate, Mary.
What if no strings were pulled?

326
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,280
You know who else was in the 147th?

327
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,685
Lloyd Bentsen's son...

328
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,486
John Connally's son,
both of Sid Adger's sons...

329
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,888
H.L. Hunt's grandson,
the heirs to the Sakowitz fortune...

330
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:36,049
and half the starting line
of the Dallas Cowboys.

331
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,208
Yeah, I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

332
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:40,922
So, what's our next move?

333
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,161
I have no idea.

334
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,845
- I served with John Kerry.
- I served with John Kerry.

335
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,407
Kerry has not been honest
about what happened in Vietnam.

336
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,760
He is lying about his record.

337
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,169
I know John Kerry is lying
about his first Purple Heart...

338
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,810
because I treated him.

339
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,048
John Kerry lied to get his Bronze Star.

340
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,681
I know, I was there,
I saw what happened.

341
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,726
His account of what happened
and what actually happened...

342
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,526
are the difference
between night and day.

343
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,289
- Yeah?
- Who is that?

344
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,288
My secret lover, go back to sleep.

345
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,644
Have you ever heard of Linda Starr?

346
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,726
She runs this website, it's like
a clearing house for anti-Bush stuff.

347
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,005
She's hinting documents
are gonna be leaked soon.

348
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:29,090
What kind of documents?

349
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,122
Mary Mapes is on line two.

350
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,970
Thank you.

351
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,487
- Mary.
- Yeah, I think we've got something.

352
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,761
Anti-Bush, Internet rabble-rouser.

353
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,886
Oh, God, I talked to her for three hours,
but she put me in touch with her source.

354
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,326
A colonel who says he may have access...

355
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,125
to missing documents
in Bush's purged Guard file.

356
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:53,886
- Sounds promising.
- I got Mike Smith talking to him right now.

357
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:56,923
- Milk?
- Get a look at those documents.

358
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,488
And do some background on the colonel,
make sure he isn't nuts.

359
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:06,401
Thank you.

360
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,443
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

361
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,449
No. I saw it.

362
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,645
I saw it with my own two eyes. Those
parts of Bush's file they didn't like...

363
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:19,570
- ...they tossed in the wastebasket.
- Do you have these?

364
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,526
Bill tried to talk about this in 2000,
someone ran us off the road one night.

365
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,691
- I ain't scared of them.
- Well, I am. I am scared.

366
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,603
All right, let's say
I have the documents.

367
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,931
Why should I show them to you?
Why not one of the newspapers?

368
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,760
- Because nobody reads newspapers.
- One of the other networks, then.

369
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,724
Don't know if you've noticed,
there's not too many people...

370
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,041
who actually do what we do anymore.

371
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,243
We're 60 Minutes.
We're the gold standard.

372
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,328
We can help you.

373
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,481
Look, you come on camera...

374
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,647
No. No. No cameras.

375
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,410
Our name stays out of this.

376
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,086
They will destroy us for this,
don't you understand?

377
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:05,119
Nicki, listen.
I know what it's like to be bullied.

378
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:08,682
To feel like they're too strong,
and you're small and powerless.

379
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,529
But you're not.

380
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,721
And doing this will show them that.

381
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,326
Now, I promise...

382
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:17,171
we will protect you.

383
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,201
- These are signed by Jerry Killian.
- Yes, they are.

384
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:58,761
The first one says
that Bush made no attempt...

385
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,844
to meet his training certification.

386
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:05,282
That is a big difference
than just missing his physical.

387
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,926
And the second one
refers to his pilot position as critical.

388
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,489
Well, Bush said he stopped flying
because they no longer needed pilots.

389
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,723
But this document
would prove that statement untrue.

390
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,651
Can you think of anybody
who'd wanna fool you with these...

391
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,882
like a political dirty trick?

392
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,810
I can't think of anyone
who would hate me that much.

393
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,401
And do you have the originals of these?

394
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,285
No. No, I was only given copies.

395
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,606
And don't ask me where I got them,
I'm not gonna tell you anything else.

396
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:39,009
You get your own experts if you want to,
you have them look at them.

397
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,009
- We will.
- We will.

398
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,729
September 15th, we don't have a show.

399
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,848
CBS is running The Billy Graham Crusade.

400
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,250
- What about the 22nd?
- Preempted again. Dr. Phil special.

401
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,885
So our air date is decided
by an unholy confluence...

402
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,361
between Billy Graham
and Dr. Phil McGraw?

403
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,804
- Jesus..
- News doesn't pay the bills.

404
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,565
There is one more option.

405
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,128
- The 8th.
- As in five days from now?

406
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,682
- If you don't think...
- I need interviews.

407
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,362
I need to get the whole team to New York
and I need... First, I need Dan.

408
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,721
Where is he?

409
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,891
Hurricane Frances
is pounding the Florida coast...

410
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,521
harder than a strongman trying
to win a Kewpie doll at a carnival!

411
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,768
I'm gonna kill him.

412
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,126
You may not have to.

413
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:35,002
Maybe I can get him on a puddle jumper
to Austin for the Strong interview.

414
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,603
I got an e-mail from the colonel about
the documents saying, "I feel better."

415
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,682
- Yeah?
- A memorandum for record...

416
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,529
is a memo to nobody, right?

417
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,528
So why does Killian file them?

418
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,570
Well, Killian knows suspending a guy
this protected is a big deal.

419
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,765
He's trying to do the right thing here, but
he needs a paper trail to insulate himself.

420
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,806
Which means Bush's protection
must've come from higher up than Killian.

421
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,411
You're thinking Hodges?

422
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:08,207
He was Killian's direct supervisor.
I'll call you back.

423
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,769
You have reached the Hodges'
residence, please leave a message.

424
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,886
General Hodges,
Mary Mapes from 60 Minutes.

425
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:27,480
I was wondering
if you could give me a call back.

426
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,728
Holy shit!

427
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:34,369
You gotta see this.
It's a video from a cell phone...

428
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,006
at a Democratic fundraiser.

429
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,480
Now... Thank you. Thank you.

430
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,445
Now, let's talk about John Kerry
and George Bush.....

431
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,486
- Is that Ben Barnes?
- And I'm not name-dropping.

432
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,442
You see, I got a young man
named George Bush....

433
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,849
into the Air National Guard when
I was lieutenant governor of Texas.

434
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,770
Now, I'm not necessarily
proud of that, but....

435
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,689
Holy shit!

436
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,567
I didn't know they were taping me.
Did you see it? I looked like shit!

437
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:10,084
- I thought you looked wonderful, Ben.
- Oh, don't you start.

438
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,449
The cat's already out of the bag
and your man Kerry's 10 points down.

439
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,486
We're airing this piece in five days.
Are you in or not?

440
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,924
- We got him! We got Barnes!
- Burkett just called.

441
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,163
- He's got more memos to hand off.
- We need to find his source.

442
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:26,202
- Okay.
- Be at the airport in the morning.

443
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:29,489
- I'll fax you when I get there.
- Yes!

444
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,362
"Bush wasn't here during rating
and I don't have any feedback...

445
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:43,125
from 187th in Alabama. I will not rate.
Austin is not happy either."

446
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,767
"Bush was not here
during rating period."

447
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,921
They're trying to get Killian to file a rating
for Bush while he wasn't even on base.

448
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,723
This is proof he was AWOL.

449
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,602
Who do I talk to first?

450
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,805
Is there any doubt in your mind
that these memos are genuine?

451
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,324
Well, they are compatible with the way
business was done at that time.

452
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:14,807
They are compatible with the man
that I remember Jerry Killian being.

453
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,809
And what do you think Colonel Killian
was trying to do?

454
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,684
I think he was trying
to get a duty performed...

455
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,203
and he was trying to protect himself
because of the political environment.

456
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,803
So political considerations
were a major force in the Guard?

457
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:38,523
It verged on outright corruption,
the favors that were done...

458
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,121
the power that was traded.

459
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:44,171
From a moral and ethical standpoint...

460
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,729
it was unconscionable.

461
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,241
Let's go to New York.

462
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:02,760
I didn't get a chance
to introduce myself.

463
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,122
- Dan Rather.
- No shit.

464
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:08,130
I mean, I'm Mike Smith. I'm familiar...

465
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,528
I mean... I... I... I'm... Hello.

466
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,721
You know, Mary tells me you're the one
that calls me "the old man."

467
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:21,050
Well, I... I really wish
she hadn't shared that with you.

468
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,451
Look, I appreciate the hard work
you're doing on this.

469
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,246
Asking questions, that's important.

470
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,807
Some people are gonna say
it doesn't matter.

471
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,963
One side or the other's always gonna say
you're being partisan.

472
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,481
But you stop asking questions,
that's when the American people lose.

473
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,330
Now, that may sound hokey,
but I believe it.

474
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,682
So keep it up.

475
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,203
Y... Yeah... Or no. Thank you.

476
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,128
You're welcome.

477
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:55,481
You know what's crazy?

478
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,406
Many things are crazy.

479
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:02,650
Tell me specifically
what you feel is crazy.

480
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:06,162
The fact that they kept this secret
for so long.

481
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,680
You do know why Mary didn't get
this story done in 2000, don't you?

482
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:21,840
Mary's mother died...

483
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:24,122
right in the middle of it.

484
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:28,559
And then the story never got finished
and the election happened.

485
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:33,242
An election that was decided
by 537 votes.

486
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,967
I think...

487
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:38,683
that if Mary's mother
hadn't died that summer...

488
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,726
there's a real good chance that
AI Gore would be president right now.

489
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,886
And what about her father?

490
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,084
Mary's father
is a drunken piece of shit...

491
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,442
who hated himself so much,
he beat his own daughters.

492
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,164
The more outspoken they were,
she says, the harder he hit them.

493
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:07,284
- So how do you think she fared?
- She would get beat up...

494
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,768
- ...for asking questions?
- That's right.

495
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,564
And this is what she does for a living?

496
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,321
People are funny sometimes.

497
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,521
It's part of what's between her and Dan,
I think.

498
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,290
Why they work so well together.

499
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:28,526
It's why they need each other.

500
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,487
Fathers and daughters.

501
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,169
Tell me about the document examiners.

502
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,365
There are four. Marcel Matley is coming
from San Francisco to do on-camera.

503
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:00,079
Linda James in Texas
wants to see the originals.

504
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:02,407
- Yeah, we don't have them.
- I told her.

505
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:05,046
Jim Pierce in Los Angeles
just started today...

506
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,284
and Emily Will in North Carolina
wants you to call her.

507
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,605
Right. Got it.

508
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,961
I think you have a problem.

509
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,281
I've been doing Internet research.

510
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,326
President was in Alabama when
these were written, they can't be true.

511
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,961
Okay. Have you found anything wrong
with the documents themselves?

512
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,881
- Well, no, but...
- Do they appear forged in any way?

513
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:28,127
- Without the originals...
- That's okay.

514
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:30,925
You just let me worry
about the investigational side.

515
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,965
I always work the whole thing.

516
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:37,285
Look, do you know
where these originated?

517
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,886
Establishing chain of custody
would go a long way...

518
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:42,008
toward determining authenticity.

519
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,441
Yeah, believe me, we're working on it.

520
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,440
I give you the memos, you verify them,
that was the deal.

521
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,482
You call the Kerry campaign for me yet?

522
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,761
They cannot lie down
on this Swift Boat shit.

523
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,490
If you could just confirm where you got
the memos from, we would be home free.

524
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,523
- I told you I cannot go on the record.
- I know.

525
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,121
I know. You wouldn't have to.

526
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:08,000
You just give me the name.
All right? That's all I need.

527
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,519
George Conn.

528
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,002
- Buddy of mine in the Guard.
- Right.

529
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,521
He was there for the scrubbing.
But you call him, he will deny it.

530
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,803
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

531
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,567
You have reached the Conn residence.
Please leave a message.

532
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:36,161
Colonel, this is Mary Mapes
with 60 Minutes.

533
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:39,203
Was wondering if you could give me
a call at your convenience.

534
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,883
It's regarding a story we're airing
on Wednesday night. Thank you.

535
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,605
- Matley's here.
- Yeah.

536
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,366
I would say, based on
our available handwriting evidence...

537
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,961
yes, this is the same person.

538
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:57,365
This signature on the June 24th document
shows some conspicuous differences.

539
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:00,883
But it also shows some inconspicuous...

540
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:03,480
similarities
to Colonel Killian's handwriting.

541
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,205
Right, and why might
differences like this exist?

542
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,046
The content of the memo
is highly stressful...

543
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:13,523
Killian telling a higher-up that he
cannot rate Bush during his absence.

544
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,169
This is enough to explain differences
in the pen strokes.

545
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:23,560
Would you excuse me a moment?

546
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,605
It's like watching paint dry.
What am I gonna do?

547
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:32,844
That was in there somewhere.
Think you can get the bite?

548
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,202
- Did I have lint on my jacket?
- Two bottles of whiskey.

549
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,730
Okay.

550
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,407
So, sir, are you saying that if I
present this to the American public...

551
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,807
and say that to the best
of our knowledge...

552
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,561
these documents are all signed
by the same man, am I on solid ground?

553
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,486
Yes.

554
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,126
Matley's a yes. Jim Pierce is a yes.
Emily Will's still working.

555
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,170
Linda James wants more documents,
but she'll defer to Matley.

556
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:07,603
Dates, contents of the Burkett memos
mesh with the official record.

557
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:11,401
And I'm having Graphics
mock something up to show it visually.

558
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,931
We don't have it yet.

559
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,922
Somebody has got to confirm
the content of those memos.

560
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:18,804
Somebody who knew the players.

561
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,968
No one in the Guard is gonna step up.

562
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,806
Look what happened to Burkett. You talk,
you get your head handed to you.

563
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,604
Who were Killian's commanders?

564
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,963
There's Buck Staudt, who figuratively
and literally told me to go fuck myself...

565
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,970
and Bobby Hodges,
who I've left 18 messages for.

566
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:39,250
Fine, I'll do 19.

567
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,240
You guys feel like pizza?

568
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,769
I really feel like we should
start thinking about pizza.

569
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,644
Hello?

570
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,208
- General Hodges?
- Yeah.

571
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:16,001
This is Mary Mapes with 60 Minutes.

572
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,960
I'd like to speak with you
about some old memos...

573
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:24,887
I've come across from the 187th
Fighter Interceptor Squadron.

574
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,164
They appear to be...

575
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,364
from the personal files
of Jerry Killian.

576
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,960
Well, I'd like to read them to you,
if that's okay?

577
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,923
All right.

578
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:48,530
Okay. The first one
is dated June 24, 1973.

579
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,248
And the subject is Bush, George W.,
first lieutenant.

580
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,929
"Sir. I got a call from your staff
concerning the evaluation...

581
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:00,565
of First Lieutenant Bush due this month.

582
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,969
His rater is Lieutenant Colonel Harris.

583
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:08,603
Neither Lieutenant Colonel Harris or I
feel we can rate First Lieutenant Bush...

584
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,282
since he was not training
with the 111th FIS since April 1972.

585
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,963
His recent activity
is outside the rating period.

586
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:21,920
Advise me how we
are supposed to handle this."

587
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,090
Okay, the...

588
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:34,208
This one is August 18, 1973
and the subject titled CYA...

589
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,443
which I believe means "cover your ass"?

590
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:43,690
Okay. "Staudt has obviously pressured
Hodges more about Bush.

591
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,884
I'm having trouble running interference
and doing my job.

592
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,603
Harris gave me a message today
from Group regarding Bush's OETR...

593
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,166
and Staudt is pushing to sugarcoat it.

594
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,284
Bush wasn't here during rating period...

595
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,369
and I don't have any feedback
from 187th in Alabama.

596
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:02,561
I will not rate.

597
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,246
Austin is not happy today either.

598
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,920
Harris took the call from Group today.

599
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,521
I'll backdate but won't rate.

600
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:15,086
Harris agrees."

601
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:22,530
Sir, are these memos familiar to you?

602
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:25,362
They are.

603
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:31,126
But using someone's personal notes,
that's going overboard.

604
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,166
You're trying to make news, create
a story here where there isn't one.

605
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,206
No, sir, we're not trying
to create anything.

606
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,009
Hold on a minute. Hold.

607
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,445
We have it.

608
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,449
Tell me the truth, and the whole truth,
about what happened...

609
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:55,041
with George W. Bush
and the draft and the National Guard.

610
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,690
Sid Adger, a friend of the Bush family,
came to see me...

611
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,282
and he asked me if I would recommend...

612
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,528
George W. Bush
for the Air National Guard.

613
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:10,403
And I did.

614
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,525
I'm concerned about
the sheer amount of story we have.

615
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:17,246
You know, what if we split it?
You know, run Barnes tomorrow...

616
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,760
and the documents
on the Sunday broadcast.

617
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,971
Sunday's show won't give us the real
estate. Where are we with the rest of it?

618
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,646
Well, I just got an e-mail
from Emily Will.

619
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,126
She has some concerns
about the superscript thing.

620
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,925
- Superscript?
- It's the raised "th" after the 111.

621
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,925
She was worried that function wasn't
available on military typewriters in the '70s.

622
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:39,010
But I spoke to Matley,
he said they were available then...

623
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:41,362
so Emily said she'd defer to him.

624
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,686
Good, all right.

625
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,043
White House will have someone
for on-camera in the morning.

626
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,489
I can't send Dan because of the storm.

627
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:52,570
That fucking hurricane hates me.

628
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,606
Well, I don't think
that I had the right...

629
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,371
to have the power that I had.

630
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:04,248
To choose who was gonna go to Vietnam
and who was not gonna go to Vietnam.

631
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,960
That's a power in some instances
when I look at those names...

632
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:12,324
of maybe determining life or death,
and that's not a power I wanna have.

633
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:17,242
Too strong or not,
to say you're ashamed of it now?

634
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,407
Oh, I think that that would be
an appropriate thing.

635
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,570
I'm very, very sorry.

636
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,967
What's it running?

637
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:36,568
It's 60 minutes, at least three over.

638
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,809
Some of the document stuffs a little slow,
you can trim there.

639
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:43,487
How about flipping it, open with Barnes,
then do the documents?

640
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:45,648
Keep it chronological.

641
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,483
You've got three hours.

642
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:49,688
- Okay.
- Right.

643
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,246
Now, this signature,
on the June 24th document...

644
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,601
shows some conspicuous differences.

645
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,371
But it also shows some inconspicuous...

646
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,648
No. Go back. It's still too long.

647
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,161
- Go back to the bit where he's...
- You've gotta lose Matley.

648
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,686
We're 40 seconds over,
and he's a shit interview.

649
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,443
The meshing graphic doesn't work.

650
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:11,326
It shows where the new documents fall in
with the originals. If we lose that...

651
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:14,000
Poorly. Look, we're out of time.

652
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:16,686
It's your call. What do you wanna do?

653
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,929
Cut it.

654
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:32,043
- We need to output in two minutes.
- I know.

655
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,128
If we don't start outputting,
we're not gonna have a show.

656
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,083
- Lock it and start outputting.
- If there's a computer hiccup...

657
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,568
- Tom, I worship you, but shut the fuck up.
- Okay. All right.

658
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,407
Eighteen new castaways
will face their toughest challenge yet.

659
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,208
Survivor: Vanuatu premieres Thursday
at 8,7 Central. Only on CBS.

660
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,800
Somebody's gonna get burned.

661
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:06,929
The military records of the two men
running for president...

662
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,362
have become part of the political arsenal
in this campaign.

663
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:13,130
A tool for building up or blowing up...

664
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,961
each candidate's credibility
as America's next commander-in-chief.

665
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:22,164
While Senator Kerry has been targeted
for what he did in combat in Vietnam...

666
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,806
President Bush has been criticized
for avoiding Vietnam...

667
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,289
by landing a much sought-after spot
in the Texas Air National Guard...

668
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:35,925
and then, apparently, failing to meet
some of his obligations in the Guard.

669
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:40,449
Did then Lieutenant Bush
fulfill all his military commitments?

670
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:44,769
And just how did he land that coveted
slot in the Guard in the first place?

671
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,081
Tonight, we have new documents...

672
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,489
and new information
on the president's military service.

673
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,487
And the first interview
with the man who says...

674
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:56,371
he pulled the strings
to get young George W. Bush...

675
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:59,403
into the Texas Air National Guard.

676
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,047
The president's time
in the National Guard reemerged today.

677
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:27,483
He enlisted in Texas,
transferred to Alabama...

678
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,570
- ...and got out early to attend...
- This is what our business has become.

679
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,764
Reporting on reporting. I mean,
why go to the trouble of breaking news...

680
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,648
when all you have to do is just talk
about other people breaking news, huh?

681
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:44,170
Thirty minutes from now, someone
somewhere is gonna be doing...

682
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,648
a story about this guy
doing a story about us.

683
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,963
You know what?
They're all gonna get Peabodys.

684
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,963
This one mattered.

685
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,204
It was great. Even the kid liked it.

686
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,686
Oh, really?

687
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,282
Yeah. Yeah, you're a hell
of a reporter, babe.

688
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,641
All right, well, I'll be home tomorrow.

689
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,284
Okay, fly safe.

690
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:12,246
- All right, I love you.
- Bye.

691
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:49,405
Hey, Mary?

692
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,563
What's going on? Because these...

693
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,048
These blogs are saying the memos can
be re-created exactly in Microsoft Word.

694
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:02,722
- Who's saying this?
- Well, it's a conservative website, but...

695
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,922
"Every one of these memos
is in proportionally spaced font.

696
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:09,322
It's probably Palatino
or Times New Roman.

697
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,724
In 1972, typewriters
used monospaced fonts.

698
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,365
Proportionally spaced fonts
did not come into use...

699
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:18,403
until the introduction
of personal computers.

700
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:21,126
They were not widespread
until the '90s. Before then...

701
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,922
you needed typesetting equipment.
That wasn't used for personal memos.

702
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,766
I'm saying these documents
are forgeries...

703
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,851
run through a copier
for 15 generations...

704
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,646
to make them look old."

705
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:39,646
Okay.

706
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:50,489
Mary?

707
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:53,400
What the hell is going on?

708
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,686
"Spacing is not just similar,
it is identical in every respect.

709
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,646
Notice that the date lines up perfectly,
the line breaks are in the same places...

710
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:06,329
all letters line up
with the same letters above and below.

711
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:08,648
And the kerning is exactly the same.

712
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,083
And I did not change a single thing
from Word's defaults.

713
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:18,925
Margins, type size, tab stops, etcetera,
are all using the default settings."

714
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,646
What the hell are we gonna do?

715
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,284
Due respect, did you fuck up?

716
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,001
We had four document examiners
and not one said the memos weren't real.

717
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,726
Did any of them try typing them
into Microsoft Word?

718
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,086
I don't know,
I'm not a document examiner.

719
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,364
But I'm assuming their job is to make
sure these things weren't whipped up.

720
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:43,929
- Just because guys on the Internet...
- It's not just the guys on the Internet.

721
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:45,724
ABC News is going after this.

722
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,240
- Nightline.
- You mean they're going after Dan?

723
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,840
- Yes.
- Tell them about the superscript.

724
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,724
It's the "th" that pops up
after you type a number.

725
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,969
- Like 111th.
- Yeah. I know what it is. What about it?

726
00:45:57,159 --> 00:46:00,527
Bloggers are saying it's a big red flag
this was done on a computer.

727
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:03,643
They say it didn't exist
on typewriters in the 1970s.

728
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,289
- Well...
- One of the examiners...

729
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,601
did raise that concern as well.

730
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:09,405
Emily Will.

731
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,967
Yeah, but Matley said they did
have them, and she deferred to him.

732
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:15,362
They will kill us on that alone.

733
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:19,610
- I don't understand, what do they want?
- They want us to say we're wrong.

734
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,164
Because if we're wrong...

735
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,251
all the questions we've asked
about the president's service go away.

736
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:27,722
Look. Okay.

737
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,121
We have the document examiners, okay?

738
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,891
Bob Strong,
who worked at Guard headquarters...

739
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:36,481
says the memos are written
in the vernacular of the Guard at the time.

740
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:39,849
And we have Bobby Hodges,
Killian's commanding officer...

741
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,684
who confirmed both the content...

742
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,769
and that they reflected
Killian's state of mind at the time.

743
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,563
We have this story.

744
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,045
Well, make sure.

745
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,889
Reconfirm with everybody.

746
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,164
And find us another goddamn "th"
in the official record.

747
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:04,003
We need to find that "th."

748
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,485
- Hi.
- Yo.

749
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,409
- You heard?
- Yeah, yeah. It's bullshit.

750
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:19,289
Pardon my French.

751
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:23,240
People have attacked me for 30 years,
it's not about to start bothering me now.

752
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,005
Now, are you okay?

753
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,967
We're gonna be in a fight here, Dan.

754
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:32,847
- I still got a few good ones left in me.
- Did you get your contract sewn up yet?

755
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:36,362
I got the head of the news division
his job, I'm gonna be fine.

756
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:38,847
You gonna give me something
to hit back with?

757
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,969
Yes, sir.

758
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,844
The blast went off at 10:30 local time
at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta...

759
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:49,010
killing nine people and wounding 180.

760
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,329
Jemaah Islamiah,
the Southeast Asian terrorist group...

761
00:47:52,519 --> 00:47:54,726
claimed responsibility for the attack.

762
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,889
...but several document experts
contacted by ABC News...

763
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,244
have raised serious questions about
the authenticity of these new documents.

764
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,724
They point to the typeface, spacing
and perfectly even imprint of the letters...

765
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:11,083
that look more like the creation
of a computer than a typewriter.

766
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,244
And there's this,
the little superscript "th."

767
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:19,081
That's something very few typewriters
could do in 1972.

768
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,568
You have reached the Hodges'
residence. Please leave a message.

769
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,047
General Hodges...

770
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:29,244
this is Mary Mapes. We need
to get in touch again. Can you call me?

771
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,965
Thank you.

772
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:41,001
...avoid Vietnam has followed him
since he ran for governor of Texas...

773
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:46,001
- ...and Mr. Bush has always denied it.
- I enjoyed it and I enjoyed my service...

774
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,650
Nothing.

775
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,206
You done with these?

776
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,963
- Never were mine.
- Okay.

777
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:00,443
...that he was a person who did n...

778
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:02,728
Staudt was already out of the Guard.

779
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,204
What are you talking about?

780
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,041
The CYA memo, dated August 18, 1973.

781
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:14,882
"Staudt has obviously
pressured Hodges more about Bush."

782
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:17,679
Staudt left the Guard in 1972.

783
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,086
So how the fuck
can he still be pressuring?

784
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,764
Listen, when a commanding officer...

785
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,248
- No, the bloggers are having a field day.
- When a general leaves his posting...

786
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,289
and goes to work for Quantico
on the same base...

787
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,565
he still wields an enormous amount of
influence. It doesn't matter when he left.

788
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,762
- Back me up, Roger.
- She's right.

789
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,925
Yeah. Right, well...

790
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,246
Forgive me if I don't think everyone
is gonna see it the same way you do.

791
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,887
This is bad.

792
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:05,567
No, when they start asking
to talk to our source...

793
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,682
then it'll be bad.

794
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,846
They're coming for us, Roger.

795
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,009
I've got one.

796
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:43,804
What?

797
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,085
I have a superscript "th" here.

798
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,168
Josh!

799
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,125
Call Dan,
tell him we just got in the fight.

800
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:01,409
So can the experts say, George,
positively that these weren't typed...

801
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,079
and couldn't have been made
in the early '70s?

802
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:07,005
They say all the clues indicate that.
They're not making...

803
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:11,443
an absolute 100 percent guarantee,
and CBS is still standing by its story.

804
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,728
And in fact, they're also
pointing to another source...

805
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,610
a Colonel Robert Hodges...

806
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,411
who was an immediate superior
of Mr. Killian.

807
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,523
They say they read these documents
to Colonel Hodges.

808
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,922
He said, "Sounds like what Killian
was telling me at the time."

809
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:27,849
Hodges is not speaking to anyone yet.

810
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,447
Because we can't get him
on the fucking phone!

811
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:34,891
Those raising questions
about the documents...

812
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:37,923
have focused on something
called superscript.

813
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:41,726
A key that automatically types
a raised "th."

814
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:47,085
Critics claim typewriters didn't have
that ability in the 1970s, but some did.

815
00:51:47,719 --> 00:51:51,644
In fact, other Bush military records
released by the White House itself...

816
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,807
show the same superscript.

817
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:56,963
Here's one from 1968.

818
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,804
Some analysts outside CBS...

819
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,851
say they believe the typeface
on these memos is New Times Roman...

820
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:05,963
which they claim was not available
in the 1970s.

821
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:09,561
But the owner of the company
that distributes this typing style...

822
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,525
says it has been available since 1931.

823
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:15,849
Document and handwriting examiner
Marcel Matley...

824
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:18,610
analyzed the documents for CBS News.

825
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,643
He says he believes they are real...

826
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,367
but is concerned about
exactly what is being examined...

827
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:27,608
by some of the people
now questioning the documents.

828
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:31,440
Because deterioration occurs
each time a document is reproduced.

829
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:35,769
And the documents being analyzed
outside of CBS had been photocopied...

830
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,128
faxed, scanned and downloaded...

831
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:42,085
and are far removed
from the documents CBS started with.

832
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,364
Matley did this interview with us
prior to Wednesday's broadcast.

833
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:50,923
We look basically at what's called
significant or insignificant features...

834
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:54,123
to determine
whether it's the same person or not.

835
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,244
So I have no problem identifying them.

836
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,768
I would say based on our available
handwriting evidence...

837
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,963
yes, this is the same person.

838
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:08,170
Matley finds the signatures to be
some of the most compelling evidence.

839
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,045
We talked to him again today
by satellite.

840
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:16,443
Are you surprised questions come about
these? We're not, but are you surprised?

841
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:21,489
I knew going in this was dynamite,
one way or the other.

842
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:27,050
And I knew that potentially this could do
far more damage to me professionally...

843
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:28,889
than benefit me.

844
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:31,286
And... And I knew that.

845
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:35,525
But... But we seek the truth.
That's what we do.

846
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,009
You're supposed to put yourself out,
seek the truth...

847
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:41,567
and take what comes from it.

848
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,248
For the CBS Evening News...

849
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,965
Dan Rather reporting.

850
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:47,644
Good night.

851
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,206
And we're clear.

852
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:57,728
- I told you I had it in me.
- I'm calling Andrew right now.

853
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,849
- F.E.A.
- No kidding.

854
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:02,327
- What'd you think?
- I think you parked it.

855
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,606
Bobby Hodges is on the phone.

856
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,929
General Hodges? This is Mary Mapes.
I've got Dan Rather on the line with me.

857
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,726
Why is The Washington Post describing
me as your trump card in this?

858
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:19,010
Did you tell them that, Dan?

859
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:20,724
I did not, sir.

860
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,289
It says a highly placed CBS source
referred to me as your trump card.

861
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,688
Well, sir, that was not me
and it was not Dan.

862
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,362
Well, good, because I'm not.
I've seen all the coverage.

863
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,768
And I have to say
I think these memos are fake.

864
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,684
You...? Excuse me?

865
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,525
I do not believe Jerry Killian
wrote those memos.

866
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:42,403
Sir, when we spoke on...

867
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:46,842
September 6th... I'm sorry,
I'm just going through my notes.

868
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:50,885
When we spoke, you said the content
of the memos was familiar to you.

869
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:52,610
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

870
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,690
And that they reflected
Colonel Killian's mind-set at the time.

871
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,369
And they do.

872
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,882
But I hadn't physically seen them.

873
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:06,605
So, what physically about the memos
makes you now doubt their authenticity?

874
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,565
Jerry's family says
he didn't write them.

875
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,724
General, the thrust of our story
was about what happened...

876
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:17,601
with the president's Guard service.
Now, if as you say...

877
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,246
Colonel Killian really did feel
this way...

878
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:24,239
and the things described
in the memos are true...

879
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,289
we'd like to talk to you about that.

880
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,768
I'm just telling you
I now believe the memos are forgeries.

881
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,643
Forget the memos, sir.

882
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:36,766
Ls what we presented
about President Bush accurate?

883
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,445
- I don't wanna get in the middle of this.
- Get him to go on camera.

884
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,603
Would you be willing if I came to see you
to talk to me on camera?

885
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,880
No, Dan, I'm sorry.

886
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,320
Maybe after the election.

887
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:53,170
- General, if you...
- Look, the family says they're fake.

888
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:57,570
And I'm supporting the family, okay?
I'm sorry.

889
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:01,603
Shit!

890
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,530
All right, what are we doing
about Hodges recanting?

891
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:06,563
We say we respect General Hodges...

892
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,405
and believed him the first time
we spoke with him.

893
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,126
ABC is reaching out
to two of our examiners.

894
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,210
Emily Will and Linda James. They say
they never authenticated the memos.

895
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,965
Of course they didn't.

896
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:20,730
- Why?
- They...

897
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,251
They... They couldn't.

898
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:28,402
Well, because they're copies.

899
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:31,887
There's no original ink or paper
to, you know, test.

900
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,367
No one can say with 100 percent
certainty they're real or forgeries.

901
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:39,650
- That's why they can attack us.
- Except on the Internet, they are certain...

902
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:43,048
- Those are lousy wannabe analysts.
- We get lousy analysts of our own.

903
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:46,561
Our story was about whether Bush's
connections got him into the Guard...

904
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:49,041
and covered for him
when he missed commitments.

905
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:50,884
Research we found backs that up.

906
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:54,721
The documents, they were a small part.
They were not the point of the story.

907
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,809
It doesn't matter what the point
of the story was. We have to...

908
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,007
- They do not get to do this.
- Do what?

909
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:04,603
They do not get to smack us
just for asking a fucking question.

910
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,847
Monday morning...

911
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:20,561
I want analysts backing us up.

912
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:23,050
Let's go.

913
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,849
- Hey.
- Hey.

914
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,206
When did you get in?

915
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,764
I was worried there might be cameras at
the airport. Didn't want Robbie to see that.

916
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:15,804
God, what are you doing in here?

917
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,324
- Working.
- Why don't you take a break?

918
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:21,648
I'll go get dressed, we can take a walk.

919
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:25,889
No, I don't need to take a fucking walk.
I wanna sit here and do this, okay?

920
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:30,563
This... Okay.

921
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,523
I'm sorry.

922
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:55,048
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

923
00:59:55,239 --> 00:59:59,483
It's just... No matter what I say,
no matter what I do, I'm gonna get hit.

924
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,369
This....

925
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,728
This is not that.

926
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,686
When my dad would start in on me,
I would think:

927
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,523
"I am not gonna cry.

928
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:18,643
I am not gonna ask him to stop.

929
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,043
I'm not gonna give him the satisfaction
of seeing how much it hurts."

930
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:23,849
And he would just go in harder.

931
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:28,728
And I would think,
"Someday, I am gonna fight you."

932
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:32,331
And I never did.

933
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,523
Now.

934
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,887
You have to fight now.

935
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:51,724
Everything that's in those documents
that people are saying can't be done...

936
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,362
as you said, 32 years ago,
is just totally false.

937
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:59,201
Not true. Like I said,
proportional spacing was available.

938
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,403
Superscripts was available
as a custom feature.

939
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:06,490
Go back to the beginning of the list.
I think that's useful, don't you, Roger?

940
01:01:08,199 --> 01:01:10,009
Word's come down from Andrew.

941
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:11,929
They wanna talk to your source.

942
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,483
Well, what if my source
doesn't wanna talk to them?

943
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:17,125
Then you'll convince him.

944
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,920
You're good at convincing people
to do things, aren't you, Mary?

945
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,844
I just want you to know how important
your support has been...

946
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,603
throughout this entire process.

947
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,565
Call your fucking source, Mary.

948
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,050
Now...

949
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:38,920
it's bad.

950
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:41,202
- You said he wouldn't have to.
- I know, just...

951
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,920
You'd verify the documents
and he wouldn't have to do anything else.

952
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,929
Well, it didn't work out that way, did it?

953
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:52,329
Oh, I'm sorry, Nicki. I'm just...
I'm ti... I'm just tired.

954
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,003
Bill did nothing wrong.

955
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:56,610
No one's saying he did.

956
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,485
I just need to get him on the phone
with my boss...

957
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,364
and tell him what he told me.

958
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:08,811
It would mean a lot to Dan.

959
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,887
Would you, please?

960
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,608
Bill, this is Andrew Heyward,
I'm the president of CBS News.

961
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,880
Is Dan there?

962
01:02:21,159 --> 01:02:22,730
I'm here, colonel.

963
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,280
Well, I heard Hodges turned tail on you.

964
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,960
All these guys run from it.

965
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:30,969
You know I got health problems.

966
01:02:31,239 --> 01:02:35,164
I had heard that, which is why I don't
wanna take up too much of your time.

967
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,284
I was wondering if you could fill me in
on a few things.

968
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:39,567
Shoot.

969
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,445
Well, how you came to be in possession
of the documents.

970
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:45,246
You told Mary it was from a man
named George Conn?

971
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,331
Well, she was bugging me so much
about it, I had to tell her something.

972
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,688
So that's not accurate?

973
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:57,123
- No, sir, it is not.
- Fucking....

974
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:00,324
Would you mind telling us
what really happened?

975
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:02,362
I got a call in March from a guy...

976
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,847
who said a woman named Lucy Ramirez...

977
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:06,963
wanted to get in contact with me.

978
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:10,800
He told me to call the Houston
Holiday Inn between 7 and 10...

979
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,240
and ask for a specific room...

980
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,123
so I did.

981
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,369
This woman told me
she was supposed to be a go-between...

982
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:22,047
a person to deliver
a package of documents to me.

983
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:24,846
And I was supposed to copy
the documents...

984
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:29,250
and then burn the originals, which
were also copies, and the envelope.

985
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,882
- Bullshit.
- Destroy the DNA evidence...

986
01:03:32,119 --> 01:03:34,168
of where they come from, you see?

987
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,771
Yeah, of course.

988
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,485
So she says, "When are you gonna be
in Houston next?

989
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:41,610
I tell her, "We're coming to
the livestock show in a few weeks."

990
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,688
We sell Simmental cattle.

991
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,527
The show is an excellent way
to advertise our bull semen.

992
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:51,679
So the first day at the show,
a dark-skinned fella comes up...

993
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:54,451
and hands me an envelope and walks away.

994
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:56,210
Inside are those memos.

995
01:03:57,199 --> 01:03:59,487
I burned the rest like he said.

996
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:00,840
Done and done.

997
01:04:02,679 --> 01:04:06,889
And was this the same man
who talked to you on the phone?

998
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:10,329
No idea. Maybe.

999
01:04:10,519 --> 01:04:14,650
And you didn't tell Mary
all this before because....

1000
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,407
Well, I... I said I'd keep it quiet.

1001
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:22,081
Mary did a good job on this.
Don't judge her too harshly.

1002
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,282
Thanks, Bill.

1003
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,126
Well, Bill, this is....

1004
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,728
This is pretty amazing stuff.

1005
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:35,922
I wonder if you'd be willing to come down
and sit and talk about it for us.

1006
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:38,804
Help clear the air for everyone.

1007
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,923
I don't know. What do you think, Dan?

1008
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:46,967
I think they can't hit us any harder
than they already are, colonel.

1009
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:51,280
I'd go on the record and tell the truth.

1010
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,248
Be done with it.

1011
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,130
Okay.

1012
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:03,768
My office will make
the necessary arrangements.

1013
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,480
- Thank you for your time.
- Goodbye.

1014
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:15,402
- We need him on the air soon. Betsy.
- Yep.

1015
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,286
Mary, will you hang back a sec?

1016
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:35,447
With Burkett, there needs to be
a line of questioning about his motives.

1017
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:39,445
His political leanings, his views
on the president, why he lied.

1018
01:05:39,639 --> 01:05:42,768
People will cover how we cover this.
We need to inoculate ourselves.

1019
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:45,684
Thou shalt always protect the company.

1020
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,362
I want Dan to survive this.

1021
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,963
Why wouldn't he survive this?

1022
01:05:56,679 --> 01:06:01,367
If Dan feels like this
is corporate positioning, he won't do it.

1023
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,523
He won't for me.

1024
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,882
He will for you.

1025
01:06:18,199 --> 01:06:19,769
He's on oxygen, so....

1026
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:22,246
- The vultures are here.
- Oh, Jesus.

1027
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,003
Dan! Dan!

1028
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:26,724
- Mary, comment?
- Excuse us, folks.

1029
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,001
Over here. Right here.

1030
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,005
- Excuse us. Pardon me, ma'am.
- Dan, a comment, please.

1031
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:32,405
- Excuse me.
- Dan!

1032
01:06:32,599 --> 01:06:33,931
- Excuse us.
- Dan!

1033
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:36,929
You broadcasted those fake memos.
You feel duped?

1034
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:40,130
Can you confirm the memos were typed
on a word processor?

1035
01:06:41,239 --> 01:06:43,322
How would you feel
about betraying the people?

1036
01:06:43,519 --> 01:06:44,726
- Just drive.
- Mary!

1037
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,923
Who the fuck are you people?

1038
01:06:49,719 --> 01:06:50,800
You know anybody?

1039
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,851
Yeah, if you could just see if you can
stop it, okay? Just get them to pull it.

1040
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:56,849
- Colonel.
- Yeah. All right. Bye.

1041
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:00,043
- Where are the Burketts?
- Upstairs, getting ready.

1042
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:01,885
Dan?

1043
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:04,202
We need to ask why he lied to us, okay?

1044
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,527
We need to make sure we get that.

1045
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:16,364
I just wanted to come say hello
before we get things going.

1046
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:19,085
Oh, thank you, Dan. I appreciate that.

1047
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,202
- How do you do, ma'am?
- Hello there.

1048
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,960
Now, look, these things are fairly easy.
We're just gonna sit and talk.

1049
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:26,320
- Okay.
- Okay.

1050
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:30,326
Now, I will ask you about why you misled
us. I don't want you to be surprised.

1051
01:07:30,519 --> 01:07:32,601
No, I was expecting that.

1052
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:35,724
- I'm happy to set the record straight.
- Great.

1053
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:41,210
Now, if you need to stop, need a glass of
water or anything, that's just fine. Okay?

1054
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,130
Okay, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna get my war paint on.

1055
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,721
That's the worst part of this job,
makeup.

1056
01:07:47,239 --> 01:07:49,128
The sound's ready when you are.

1057
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,525
It's gonna be fine, Nicki. Okay?

1058
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,800
Yep.

1059
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,969
But you told us a different story.

1060
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:04,170
To protect the people
who gave me the documents.

1061
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,282
Did they ask you to do this?

1062
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,641
They wanted me to burn everything.

1063
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:13,449
They didn't want people to know
that they were the source on this.

1064
01:08:13,639 --> 01:08:15,802
This man and this mystery woman.

1065
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,685
That's right.
Can I please have some water?

1066
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,847
Oh, of course.

1067
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:25,524
We need a better bite on this.

1068
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:30,168
So maybe instead of, "Did they ask you
to do this?" say, "Did they ask you to lie?"

1069
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,125
Yeah.

1070
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,966
Yeah. Okay.

1071
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:43,123
Now, we're gonna go back for a moment.

1072
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:44,367
Okay.

1073
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:50,045
This man and this mystery woman,
did they ask you to lie to us?

1074
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:54,801
They didn't want me to say
how I got the documents.

1075
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,649
I see.

1076
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:00,640
- I see. So that's why you misled us?
- Yes.

1077
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:05,083
Your producer was pushing me
to find out where I got the memos from.

1078
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,404
I see.

1079
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,524
So then, that's why you lied to us?

1080
01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:17,604
Yes.

1081
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,649
And I know it caused some...

1082
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,211
Some problems.

1083
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:22,890
Excuse me.

1084
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:03,885
- Whenever you're ready.
- Yeah.

1085
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:05,729
Okay.

1086
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,929
You said you knew that these memos
would cause a problem?

1087
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:15,011
I knew it did,
but I didn't know it at the time.

1088
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:18,841
I see. Now, again...

1089
01:10:19,079 --> 01:10:22,880
why didn't you tell us the truth
when you gave us those memos?

1090
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,329
To protect people, Dan.

1091
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:31,284
People who were trying to tell the truth
about what really happened back then.

1092
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:37,051
And do you believe those documents
are telling the truth?

1093
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:38,804
Yes. Yes, I do.

1094
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:42,881
I see.I see, so...

1095
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,439
- We already have that.
- I need to make sure we...

1096
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,966
No, we've got it. I'm moving on.

1097
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,324
He's a good guy, you know.

1098
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,601
You think I enjoyed that?

1099
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,887
We should cut something for the news...

1100
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:15,565
get it out immediately. Andrew agrees.

1101
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,085
F.E.A.

1102
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:24,725
You know, you guys and Dan always
say that. What the hell does it mean?

1103
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,567
It's open.

1104
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,210
Excuse me.

1105
01:11:38,279 --> 01:11:39,327
How's Bill?

1106
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:44,729
Oh, don't you dare ask how Bill is.

1107
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,850
Bill is sick. He's a sick man.
You don't give a damn about him.

1108
01:11:49,399 --> 01:11:52,609
You just spent two hours
trying to destroy him.

1109
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,279
You made him crawl on camera.

1110
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:58,404
You made him say again and again
that he lied.

1111
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,604
And that still wasn't enough for you.
You wanted more.

1112
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,490
You wanted to blame him
for all the things you did wrong...

1113
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,289
putting this story together.

1114
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:09,926
You wanna wrap it in a neat package,
say "It's Bill Burkett's fault."

1115
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:12,247
Well, it's not, and you know it.

1116
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:14,488
You promised when
we came here to do this...

1117
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:18,565
that we would get a fair shake,
and we got nothing from you but lies.

1118
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:21,524
- Nicki...
- You may think I am some stupid hick...

1119
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,926
who doesn't know a damn thing...

1120
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:27,010
and you're so smart and such a big shot.

1121
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:28,564
But I keep my promises...

1122
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,286
and I don't destroy people
to protect myself.

1123
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:34,962
I don't destroy people
and humiliate them...

1124
01:12:35,479 --> 01:12:39,451
and then pretend I give a goddamn
about how they are.

1125
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:44,489
To answer your question,
Bill is not good.

1126
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,926
But then, you knew that already.

1127
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,760
We need to talk.

1128
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,570
What are the chances you have
something alcoholic in there?

1129
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,408
Better than average.

1130
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,921
How long have we known each other?

1131
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:47,885
Oh, Jesus, is it that bad?

1132
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,445
They're gonna start an investigation.

1133
01:13:53,159 --> 01:13:56,368
And CBS wants to appoint
an independent panel...

1134
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,291
to take a look at how the story
was put together.

1135
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,801
And I'm gonna announce it.

1136
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:03,970
Tomorrow.

1137
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:10,801
I'm gonna apologize for the story,
on air.

1138
01:14:12,199 --> 01:14:13,963
Andrew asked you to apologize?

1139
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:18,368
He didn't ask.

1140
01:14:20,359 --> 01:14:24,409
- Dan, that's... It's surrender.
- Ever since Burkett changed his story...

1141
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,882
Andrew feels that CBS
can't afford the risk to its reputation...

1142
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:29,444
Oh, God. He knew.

1143
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,682
Even before we went down there.
Just wanted to get Burkett on tape.

1144
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,682
Mary, you gotta promise me something.

1145
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:36,930
Stop worrying about me.

1146
01:14:37,159 --> 01:14:38,844
Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen.

1147
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:41,360
You gotta protect yourself now.

1148
01:14:43,159 --> 01:14:44,764
We all do.

1149
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:52,162
Thank you for the drink.

1150
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:06,606
Now, news about CBS News...

1151
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,122
and the questions surrounding
documents we aired on this broadcast...

1152
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:13,688
and on the Wednesday edition
of 60 Minutes on September the 8th.

1153
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:18,002
The documents purported to show
George W. Bush received...

1154
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:22,564
preferential treatment during his years
in the Texas Air National Guard.

1155
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:26,287
At the time,
CBS News and this reporter...

1156
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:29,131
fully believed the documents
were genuine.

1157
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:32,006
Tonight, after further investigation...

1158
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:35,568
we can no longer vouch
for their authenticity.

1159
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:43,246
I'm sorry this was your first story here.

1160
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,970
Well, I was thinking next week...

1161
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:53,171
we just have Dan shoot the president.

1162
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:55,640
Cause a lot less drama.

1163
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:05,082
Hey... Hey, Mary, USA Today wants
to know if you put Burkett in touch...

1164
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:08,250
with the Kerry campaign
in exchange for documents.

1165
01:16:11,239 --> 01:16:14,766
I know what this is about. Josh,
do you remember when I told you...

1166
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,050
Burkett wanted to give the Kerry
campaign advice on the Swift Boat stuff?

1167
01:16:20,039 --> 01:16:22,167
Remember, I wanted
to do a bullshit check...

1168
01:16:22,359 --> 01:16:24,840
after he said he spoke with Howard Dean.

1169
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:28,680
And you said that I could contact
the Kerry people to check.

1170
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,359
Then Burkett wanted me
to give him his phone number...

1171
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,761
and you said I could, so....

1172
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,850
So... So I did. Do you...

1173
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,729
Do you not remember any of this?

1174
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,051
I must not have been clear.

1175
01:16:42,279 --> 01:16:46,079
You must have misunderstood
what it was you could do.

1176
01:16:46,279 --> 01:16:48,886
Oh, Jesus Christ, this is....

1177
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:52,603
This is unbelievable. I mean,
what the fuck else is gonna happen?

1178
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,962
- Be... Betsy...
- No.

1179
01:16:55,359 --> 01:16:59,046
You know what, Mary?
Maybe it's best if you just went home.

1180
01:17:18,039 --> 01:17:19,849
The failure of CBS News...

1181
01:17:20,039 --> 01:17:23,761
to properly, fully scrutinize
the documents and their source...

1182
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:28,886
led to our airing the documents
when we should have not done so.

1183
01:17:29,439 --> 01:17:34,207
It was a mistake.
CBS News deeply regrets it.

1184
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:39,850
Also, I want to say,
personally and directly, I am sorry.

1185
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:44,969
CBS has hired the firm of Kirkpatrick
& Lockhart Nicholson Graham...

1186
01:17:45,159 --> 01:17:47,605
to conduct a review panel.

1187
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:49,923
You paper-trailed them.

1188
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:51,886
Of course.

1189
01:17:52,079 --> 01:17:56,051
They're a big firm, got about a thousand
lawyers headquartered in Seattle.

1190
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:59,050
They specialize
in internal investigations.

1191
01:17:59,239 --> 01:18:03,369
They're the same ones that Bush brought
in last year to rip apart WorldCom.

1192
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:04,970
We're as bad as them?

1193
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:07,850
- Oh, it gets worse.
- The panel...

1194
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:13,528
will be co-chaired by K & L partner
Richard Thornburgh.

1195
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:17,167
He's the former governor
of Pennsylvania, first appointed...

1196
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,567
as a U.S. attorney under Richard Nixon.

1197
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,320
Ran for Congress twice.
Defeated both times by Democrats.

1198
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,603
His second campaign
was run by Karl Rove.

1199
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:29,445
- Yup.
- But the crown jewel in his resume...

1200
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:33,365
is the time served
as U.S. attorney general from '88 to '91

1201
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,002
under former president George H.W. Bush.

1202
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:39,009
Jesus.

1203
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:41,247
Who goes in first?

1204
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,728
First Dan, then me...

1205
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:48,050
then Lucy, the colonel, then you.

1206
01:18:48,279 --> 01:18:49,520
You're the grand finale.

1207
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,006
And why? Why is that?

1208
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:53,970
Because they wanna have
as much as they can on you...

1209
01:18:54,199 --> 01:18:56,328
when they sit you down in that chair.

1210
01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:01,128
Holy shit.

1211
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:07,243
Yeah, I'm sorry.
She's not speaking to reporters.

1212
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,844
- It's Heyward.
- If they put someone else on, hang up.

1213
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:14,564
They can't fire you if they
don't have a witness on the line.

1214
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:18,207
- Thanks for the pep talk. Andrew.
- Mary.

1215
01:19:18,439 --> 01:19:21,728
We've hired a private detective
to go back over everything.

1216
01:19:22,079 --> 01:19:25,288
I need you to hand over your notes,
your e-mails, everything.

1217
01:19:25,479 --> 01:19:28,244
Listen, I was thinking,
if we could find the typewriter...

1218
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:30,726
Stop working on the story.

1219
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:40,729
Well, all work on the Bush-Guard story
has officially ceased.

1220
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,484
I can't imagine why.

1221
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:50,242
Hey, what are you looking at, buddy?

1222
01:19:50,439 --> 01:19:52,010
The men with the cameras.

1223
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,320
Are they friends of yours?

1224
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:07,930
No.

1225
01:20:08,119 --> 01:20:09,280
Take him upstairs.

1226
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:15,251
In other news,
CBS' internal investigation...

1227
01:20:15,439 --> 01:20:19,444
into their story on George W Bush's
National Guard service begins today...

1228
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:22,689
with the review panel
convening at Black Rock.

1229
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:31,122
I left my wallet in a cab.
I'm supposed to be in front of the panel.

1230
01:20:31,319 --> 01:20:32,445
You can't be here.

1231
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:35,604
- Excuse me?
- You're not allowed in the building.

1232
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,530
I'm not allowed in the building
according to who?

1233
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:41,769
Management. You have to go, now.

1234
01:20:44,119 --> 01:20:47,090
Okay, do you understand
what's happening here?

1235
01:20:47,319 --> 01:20:49,765
I understand you're leaving.

1236
01:20:51,319 --> 01:20:55,006
Our... Your parent company
is currently lobbying...

1237
01:20:55,239 --> 01:20:58,721
a Republican-controlled Congress
for deregulation and tax breaks...

1238
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:02,560
that could potentially save them
hundreds of millions of dollars.

1239
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:06,167
And we just aired a report that
could cost those same Republicans...

1240
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:09,210
- ...the presidency.
- Security to the 10th floor now.

1241
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:13,365
You think Viacom might need
the administration on their side?

1242
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:16,689
You think they might be desperate
to make it up to him right now?

1243
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,600
Make up for CBS running stories on
Abu Ghraib, the president, and Vietnam...

1244
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:24,327
and all the other shit that isn't part
of your scheduled programming?

1245
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,724
Of course everyone wants it to disappear.
There's a fucking election at stake!

1246
01:21:29,359 --> 01:21:31,930
You're supposed to question everything.
That's your job.

1247
01:21:32,079 --> 01:21:36,130
We are supposed to question everything,
and, what, you won't even question this?

1248
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:39,360
- Are you done?
- Am I done?

1249
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,846
Know when the FCC
repealed cross-ownership laws...

1250
01:21:42,039 --> 01:21:45,725
a single company could own 45 percent
of the national market share?

1251
01:21:46,079 --> 01:21:48,845
Forty-five percent
of the national market share.

1252
01:21:49,039 --> 01:21:51,407
People fucking flipped.
They lost their shit.

1253
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,409
They actually sat down
and wrote their local congressmen.

1254
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,284
So in the 2003 appropriations bill,
guess what...

1255
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:59,561
Congress overturned it.

1256
01:22:00,439 --> 01:22:03,488
Hooray for democracy, right?

1257
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:06,001
Nope. The president wouldn't sign it.

1258
01:22:06,199 --> 01:22:09,761
Bush threatened to veto the bill unless
a compromise was found at 39 percent.

1259
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:11,006
And why 39 percent?

1260
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:14,881
That's the exact percent Viacom wouldn't
have to sell off any of their stations.

1261
01:22:15,079 --> 01:22:17,845
The president of the United States
was ready to take down...

1262
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,641
the entire federal budget
so that Viacom wouldn't lose any money!

1263
01:22:29,479 --> 01:22:31,083
You're right.

1264
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,649
Yeah, we're... We're all evil.

1265
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,042
And you're the... You're the...

1266
01:22:37,239 --> 01:22:39,128
plucky, misunderstood hero.

1267
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,962
It's not that you guys fucked up a story.
No, no, it's... it's...

1268
01:22:43,119 --> 01:22:45,770
It's a conspiracy, right?

1269
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:52,400
They're gonna screw you too, you know.

1270
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:11,484
Hey, I never got to ask you.

1271
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,729
Why did you get into journalism?

1272
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:18,162
Curiosity.

1273
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,204
That's it?

1274
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,569
That's everything.

1275
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,967
Why'd you get into it?

1276
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,046
You.

1277
01:23:38,039 --> 01:23:41,965
Mr. Rather, the panel is ready for you.

1278
01:23:55,119 --> 01:23:59,125
It's even worse than we thought.
They asked if you bullied staff or sources.

1279
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:02,011
If you physically intimidated people
to get what you want.

1280
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:04,367
I hope you told them
I beat the shit out of you.

1281
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:07,881
Mary, they... it's...
This isn't a joke, okay?

1282
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:10,207
They asked about your politics.

1283
01:24:10,439 --> 01:24:14,444
The deck is stacked, okay?
The game's rigged. Between this...

1284
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:18,280
talk radio and your father,
it's a fucking lynching.

1285
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,239
What about my father?

1286
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:25,210
Nothing. I... Don't... It's... Forget it.

1287
01:24:25,399 --> 01:24:27,368
What about my father, Mike?

1288
01:24:28,039 --> 01:24:30,042
Look, I'm sorry, I thought you knew.

1289
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,244
I'm ashamed of what my daughter
has become.

1290
01:24:35,439 --> 01:24:36,440
You are?

1291
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,847
She's a typical liberal.

1292
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,207
She went into journalism
with an ax to grind...

1293
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:44,045
and that was to promote
radical feminism.

1294
01:24:44,359 --> 01:24:47,761
So would you say
this is a pattern of hers?

1295
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,206
Oh, sure.

1296
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:51,966
You know, when I heard
this was a 60 Minutes story...

1297
01:24:52,119 --> 01:24:55,283
I figured she would be
the producer of the show.

1298
01:24:55,479 --> 01:24:57,846
She and that Dan Rather
have been working on this...

1299
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,210
ever since Bush was elected.
She should really be looking at George...

1300
01:25:13,439 --> 01:25:14,725
Hello?

1301
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:17,207
You can't talk to the press anymore,
Don.

1302
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:19,521
- Who is this?
- You know who this is.

1303
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:21,523
Just for once in your life, be decent.

1304
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:23,563
I'm expressing my opinion.

1305
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,286
I thought you reporters
were all about that.

1306
01:25:26,439 --> 01:25:29,444
Okay, well,
if you don't stop talking to the press...

1307
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:32,211
I'll fly up there myself
and break your fucking arms.

1308
01:25:32,359 --> 01:25:34,010
- How about that?
- Is that him?

1309
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,690
- Here, let me talk to him.
- Mar.

1310
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:39,564
- Mark, just give me the phone.
- Mar.

1311
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,643
Just give me the phone, Mark.

1312
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,479
- Daddy?
- Yes.

1313
01:25:50,439 --> 01:25:52,726
Daddy, please stop.

1314
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:58,171
Well, since you asked, I will.

1315
01:26:23,159 --> 01:26:25,447
I can't anymore.

1316
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,962
- Yes, you can.
- No. I don't want to.

1317
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:33,368
They can have my career. I don't care.

1318
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:37,167
God, I never should have asked
the question.

1319
01:26:38,199 --> 01:26:41,043
So, what, they're right, you're wrong?

1320
01:26:41,399 --> 01:26:43,402
Guess so.

1321
01:26:47,359 --> 01:26:51,649
And what about Dan?

1322
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:53,650
That's not fair.

1323
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,246
"It's a shame
what that woman did to Dan Rather."

1324
01:26:56,439 --> 01:26:58,043
- That's what they're saying.
- Don't.

1325
01:26:58,199 --> 01:27:02,046
"How he's going to go down?
Well, it's just a disgrace."

1326
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:05,570
And Robert'll get to see you quit,
that'll be good for him.

1327
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,085
Oh, fuck you.

1328
01:27:07,279 --> 01:27:09,043
Listen to me. Listen.

1329
01:27:09,239 --> 01:27:11,480
You gotta make your case
to the panel, honey.

1330
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:13,329
You have to fight.

1331
01:27:13,479 --> 01:27:15,881
- Even if the system's rigged?
- The system is rigged.

1332
01:27:16,079 --> 01:27:18,082
It always has been. You know that.

1333
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:21,210
You still have to tell them
what happened.

1334
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:25,090
Why?

1335
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:31,046
Because that's what we do.

1336
01:27:46,439 --> 01:27:50,239
So do you believe me?

1337
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:54,199
Do you believe I did my job'?

1338
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:58,127
- I told you it doesn't matter what I believe.
- It does to me.

1339
01:27:59,159 --> 01:28:01,207
If you'd like someone else
to represent you...

1340
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:03,646
Why don't you just tell me
why I shouldn't?

1341
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:08,884
- What do you want out of this?
- Excuse me?

1342
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:11,805
Do you wanna get into a debate
about journalism with them...

1343
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:15,282
- ...or do you wanna keep your job?
- I can't do both?

1344
01:28:15,479 --> 01:28:17,881
Not at this point, no.

1345
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,041
You're the primary breadwinner,
is that correct?

1346
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:26,805
Yes.

1347
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:29,405
And your son is 7.

1348
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,962
This isn't a trial, this is a hunt.

1349
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:36,560
This is about assignation of blame,
who is at fault.

1350
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,164
Because somebody has to be.

1351
01:28:38,319 --> 01:28:40,720
Debate that with them, and you're done.

1352
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,207
You have one chance here.

1353
01:28:43,439 --> 01:28:46,363
Among all the conservative lawyers
on that panel...

1354
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:49,091
there is one former journalist
co-chairing it.

1355
01:28:49,239 --> 01:28:52,801
Lou Boccardi, the former head
of the Associated Press.

1356
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:56,487
He's the one man who can
maybe understand what happened.

1357
01:28:56,680 --> 01:29:01,003
You convince him,
maybe he can turn the others.

1358
01:29:01,359 --> 01:29:03,761
But if you antagonize them...

1359
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:06,560
if you bait them, if you fight them...

1360
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,006
you will lose.

1361
01:29:11,119 --> 01:29:13,247
You're fucking hired.

1362
01:29:18,399 --> 01:29:20,926
You're going to cooperate in every way.

1363
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:24,649
Follow every request and instruction.

1364
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,404
There is no standard here.

1365
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,804
No books full of journalistic laws,
no written codes.

1366
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,922
There is just opinion.

1367
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:35,725
And we have to sway it.

1368
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:54,724
That's Thornburgh.

1369
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:58,610
- Which one's the journalist?
- He's just there.

1370
01:30:04,479 --> 01:30:06,608
Ms. Mapes, thanks for coming in.

1371
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:10,242
I'm Larry Lanpher. I'm lead council
along with Mike Missal here.

1372
01:30:10,399 --> 01:30:11,765
Pleasure.

1373
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:13,849
I notice there's no stenographer.

1374
01:30:14,039 --> 01:30:16,247
Well, this is an internal investigation.

1375
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:19,243
We're just gonna take
some notes as we go along.

1376
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:21,807
So there'll be no official record?

1377
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,163
It's fine.

1378
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,722
Would you like to take
a bathroom break before we begin?

1379
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:29,802
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

1380
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:31,121
I'm not that delicate.

1381
01:30:33,319 --> 01:30:36,085
- I'd like one.
- Okay.

1382
01:30:36,319 --> 01:30:38,128
Start again in two minutes, everyone.

1383
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:46,962
I want you to stay calm in there.

1384
01:30:47,119 --> 01:30:49,690
- Don't I look calm?
- Not even a little.

1385
01:30:50,399 --> 01:30:52,720
Now, they're gonna try
to catch you off balance.

1386
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:55,365
When they ask you a question, answer it.

1387
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,127
Tell them what time it is,
not how to build a clock.

1388
01:30:58,279 --> 01:31:00,328
- But...
- Don't fight.

1389
01:31:01,319 --> 01:31:02,845
Okay?

1390
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:06,884
Okay.

1391
01:31:07,359 --> 01:31:08,407
Don't fight.

1392
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,121
I'd like to talk a little bit
about language.

1393
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,408
Absolutely.

1394
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:28,649
This is a printout of e-mails
sent back and forth by your group...

1395
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,131
during the investigation.

1396
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:33,289
In this one to Mike Smith,
what did the two of you mean...

1397
01:31:33,439 --> 01:31:37,649
when you referred
to a piece of "tasty brisket"?

1398
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:42,887
That referred to a piece of information
Mike uncovered...

1399
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:46,088
working on a documentary
for the Germans.

1400
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:49,199
A piece of information
against the president?

1401
01:31:51,279 --> 01:31:55,204
I think specifically, it referred to Bush
losing his nerve while flying.

1402
01:31:55,439 --> 01:31:58,966
Which you did not mention
in the report you aired on 60 Minutes.

1403
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:01,520
I didn't think we had it nailed down.

1404
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:03,204
Would it be accurate to say...

1405
01:32:03,359 --> 01:32:06,569
you were looking for
anything negative about the president?

1406
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:09,484
I'd say it's accurate we were
looking for any information...

1407
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:12,166
on his time in the Guard
that hadn't come to light.

1408
01:32:12,399 --> 01:32:14,402
And that's what made it tasty?

1409
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:17,529
Not because it reflected poorly
on the president?

1410
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:22,128
It was tasty because
it had the potential to be newsworthy.

1411
01:32:22,279 --> 01:32:25,363
Look, Mike and I are friends,
so we use shorthand.

1412
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,210
Sarcasm, jokes. You know.

1413
01:32:27,399 --> 01:32:29,481
Is that common in your industry?

1414
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:30,886
I suppose.

1415
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:34,840
When dealing with matters as serious
as this, it's common to make jokes?

1416
01:32:36,039 --> 01:32:40,045
I can assure you,
we take our work very, very seriously.

1417
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:44,729
I also wanted to ask you
about this e-mail...

1418
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:50,488
from Roger Charles where he says
he feels better about the documents...

1419
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,529
because of their formatting.

1420
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:55,762
Colonel Charles originally thought
the documents were fake?

1421
01:32:56,239 --> 01:32:57,604
I don't believe so.

1422
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:01,567
Then... Then... Then why would
he say he feels better?

1423
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:06,127
Because it seemed that
what our source was telling us was true.

1424
01:33:06,279 --> 01:33:11,604
I have to disagree. Even the subject line
in the e-mail is "I feel better"...

1425
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:14,490
with three exclamation points.

1426
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:17,211
It seems Colonel Charles
initially had doubts.

1427
01:33:20,359 --> 01:33:23,125
I think you'd have to ask
Colonel Charles.

1428
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:33,162
But also, I would say that he was coming
from the place of not being sure...

1429
01:33:33,319 --> 01:33:37,211
if the memos were real or not, and then
becoming confident that they were.

1430
01:33:37,399 --> 01:33:38,970
Really?

1431
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:43,127
Forgive me for saying, but your testimony
so far doesn't bear that out.

1432
01:33:43,279 --> 01:33:44,770
- How so?
- Excuse me.

1433
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,842
This isn't testimony, remember?

1434
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:49,600
If it was impossible
to authenticate the memos...

1435
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:53,445
doesn't it stand to reason that you
initially assumed the memos were real...

1436
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,967
- ...rather than the other way around?
- I wouldn't say that.

1437
01:33:57,359 --> 01:33:58,805
Well, what would you say?

1438
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:02,689
It seems you assumed the memos
were real from the outset...

1439
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:06,088
and you looked to make sure
that nothing disproved that.

1440
01:34:06,279 --> 01:34:11,411
Essentially, you took the position that the
president was guilty until proven innocent.

1441
01:34:12,119 --> 01:34:14,850
We took several steps
to vet these memos.

1442
01:34:15,079 --> 01:34:16,319
Such as?

1443
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:18,405
- Well...
- There were only...

1444
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,681
two signatures,
only two sets of initials.

1445
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:23,451
Hardly enough comparison
for a handwriting match.

1446
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:27,046
And you said yourself that no carbon
or ink tests could be performed.

1447
01:34:27,239 --> 01:34:30,926
In fact, two of the four analysts you
hired said they had strong reservations...

1448
01:34:31,079 --> 01:34:32,649
about the memos' authenticity.

1449
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,805
Much of the formatting and terminology
used is consistent with the period...

1450
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,364
- ...as is...
- That's debatable.

1451
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:41,409
...consistent with the period,
as is the content of the memos...

1452
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:45,201
which was verified by several sources,
including those close to Killian.

1453
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:48,363
Then what about this?

1454
01:34:51,239 --> 01:34:52,810
"OETR"?

1455
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:57,561
Is this one of the terminologies
that's consistent with the period?

1456
01:34:58,199 --> 01:34:59,201
I believe so.

1457
01:34:59,359 --> 01:35:03,284
- What does that stand for?
- Officer Effectiveness Training Report.

1458
01:35:03,439 --> 01:35:07,331
Actually, the correct acronym is OER.

1459
01:35:07,479 --> 01:35:11,201
Officer Effectiveness Report. No T.

1460
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:15,606
Isn't it true that "Officer Effectiveness
Training Report" doesn't appear...

1461
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:19,445
anywhere on any official document,
and this is a phrase that you created...

1462
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,967
to explain this incorrect abbreviation
in your memos?

1463
01:35:23,119 --> 01:35:25,645
- That is not true.
- It isn't?

1464
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:29,605
- I would not do something like that.
- Then prove it.

1465
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:52,404
Official document, top of the page.

1466
01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:55,399
Tab 21.

1467
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:01,161
- Mike?
- Of course.

1468
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:09,404
I see that.

1469
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:11,448
I'm sorry, my mistake.

1470
01:36:23,439 --> 01:36:25,283
Clearly, you did well.

1471
01:36:25,439 --> 01:36:28,807
They're gonna regroup,
call you back in next month.

1472
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:30,291
Next month?

1473
01:36:30,439 --> 01:36:34,411
They've decided to delay announcing
the panel's findings till after the election.

1474
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:38,042
Don't look so glum.
Just keep your head down.

1475
01:36:38,199 --> 01:36:39,645
You'll make it out of this.

1476
01:36:44,399 --> 01:36:47,688
I'm looking forward to serving
this country for four more years.

1477
01:36:48,039 --> 01:36:50,485
I wanna thank you for
your hard work in the campaign.

1478
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:55,009
I told you that the other day and you
probably thought I was seeking votes.

1479
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:59,689
But now that you voted,
I really meant it.

1480
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:02,007
[appreciate the hard work
of the press corps.

1481
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:05,606
We all put in long hours. You're away
from your families for a long period.

1482
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,127
But the country's better off
when we have...

1483
01:37:08,279 --> 01:37:10,646
a vigorous and free press
covering our elections.

1484
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:12,404
And thanks for your work.

1485
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:16,167
Without over-pandering,
I'll answer a few questions.

1486
01:37:16,359 --> 01:37:17,690
Hunt?

1487
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:20,207
Mr. President. Thank you.

1488
01:37:20,359 --> 01:37:24,762
As you look at your second term, how
much is the war in Iraq going to cost?

1489
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:28,845
Do you intend to send more troops
or bring troops home?

1490
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,320
And in the Middle East more broadly...

1491
01:37:31,479 --> 01:37:35,201
do you agree with Tony Blair
that revitalizing the Middle East...

1492
01:37:35,359 --> 01:37:40,729
peace process is the single most
pressing political issue facing the world?

1493
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:43,087
Now that I've got
the will of the people...

1494
01:37:43,239 --> 01:37:47,211
I'm going to start enforcing
the one-question rule.

1495
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:49,006
That was three questions.

1496
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,528
I'll start with Tony Blair's comments.

1497
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:57,769
I agree with him that the Middle East
peace is a very...

1498
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:07,606
Hello?

1499
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:13,520
Mary, it's Dan plus three.

1500
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:17,287
Well, I'm working on
a Chardonnay Xanax cocktail...

1501
01:38:17,439 --> 01:38:19,680
if it makes you feel any better.

1502
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:23,447
Did you know that 60 Minutes
was the first news program...

1503
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,523
to ever make money?

1504
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:29,686
Before that, all news divisions
operated at a financial loss.

1505
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,528
You know, when the government
gave the networks the airwaves...

1506
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:39,444
it was with the stipulation that...

1507
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:43,326
they'd be used in some capacity
for the public good.

1508
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:45,323
And that... That was the news.

1509
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:48,000
They... They made their money
elsewhere on the schedule.

1510
01:38:48,199 --> 01:38:51,443
But reporting the news was a duty.
It was...

1511
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,961
It was a trust.

1512
01:38:54,439 --> 01:38:58,001
You know when Don Hewitt
started 60 Minutes, it was in 1968...

1513
01:38:58,239 --> 01:39:01,163
it built to enormous ratings.
God, it was...

1514
01:39:01,359 --> 01:39:03,328
God, it was wonderful.

1515
01:39:03,479 --> 01:39:08,280
I mean, people were really
watching the news. I mean, they cared.

1516
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:11,484
And, God, we figured out
a way to give it to them.

1517
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:13,563
I was there, Mary.

1518
01:39:14,319 --> 01:39:18,722
I was there the day they figured out
that news could make money.

1519
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:24,409
After a while it dawned on them,
"How come the evening news...

1520
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,921
isn't a profit center too?

1521
01:39:27,079 --> 01:39:30,208
Why aren't the morning shows
earning more?"

1522
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:35,440
If you interview Survivor contestants
instead of survivors of the genocide...

1523
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:38,001
your ad rates go up.

1524
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:45,328
Pretty soon we won't even run down our
own stories because it's too expensive.

1525
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:46,890
We'll just...

1526
01:39:48,279 --> 01:39:53,046
We'll just pay someone else to do it,
then we'll read them on the air for show.

1527
01:39:56,319 --> 01:39:59,289
It was a public trust once.

1528
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,287
I swear to you it was.

1529
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:06,761
How you doing, Dan?

1530
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,729
I'm stepping down as anchor.

1531
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,286
When?

1532
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,682
After inauguration.

1533
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,528
Oh, Dan.

1534
01:40:30,199 --> 01:40:31,564
You didn't cause this, Mary.

1535
01:40:32,039 --> 01:40:35,122
Well, you're a shitty liar,
you know that?

1536
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:41,569
Why didn't you ask me?

1537
01:40:42,039 --> 01:40:45,408
Because God knows everybody else did
when the shit hit the fan.

1538
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,523
Why didn't you?

1539
01:40:48,119 --> 01:40:49,724
Ask you what?

1540
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:53,122
Why didn't you ask me
if the documents were real?

1541
01:40:55,239 --> 01:40:57,447
Because I knew I didn't need to.

1542
01:41:00,399 --> 01:41:01,447
Hey.

1543
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:04,604
When you go back in there,
you hold your head up, you understand?

1544
01:41:06,199 --> 01:41:07,850
Yes, Dan.

1545
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:10,841
Okay. F.E.A.

1546
01:41:14,279 --> 01:41:16,408
F.E.A.

1547
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:51,603
You're doing great.

1548
01:41:52,479 --> 01:41:54,801
Another half hour, and you're done.

1549
01:41:57,359 --> 01:41:58,565
What does that mean?

1550
01:42:02,439 --> 01:42:06,206
Fuck 'em all.

1551
01:42:11,079 --> 01:42:14,003
Well, I'm glad we have clarification
on that.

1552
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:17,686
- Good.
- Well, if there's nothing else...

1553
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:20,087
Thank you, gentlemen, for the day.

1554
01:42:23,479 --> 01:42:26,926
Aren't you gonna ask me
about my politics?

1555
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:30,130
Excuse me?

1556
01:42:30,319 --> 01:42:34,564
You asked other people what I believe,
so aren't you gonna ask me?

1557
01:42:35,479 --> 01:42:36,527
What are you doing?

1558
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:41,841
Well, wouldn't you say most of the people
you work with consider you a liberal?

1559
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:48,680
Do you mean, "Am I now
or have I ever been a liberal?"

1560
01:42:59,199 --> 01:43:02,010
It's a legitimate question.

1561
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:03,640
Is it?

1562
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,284
Well, you brought it up.

1563
01:43:06,319 --> 01:43:09,289
No, you did, when you asked
all of my co-workers.

1564
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:10,801
So I'll tell you.

1565
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,368
I don't believe in labels. I think
most people have a mixture of views...

1566
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:16,283
That's not what we're talking about.

1567
01:43:16,439 --> 01:43:18,488
Then what are you talking about, Larry?

1568
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:21,842
We are talking about you bringing
your politics into your reporting.

1569
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,765
- I did nothing of the kind.
- Nothing? Really?

1570
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:27,764
Ls that why when Barnes told you
he got Bush into the Guard...

1571
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,649
you believed him without question?

1572
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:33,327
That when Bill Burkett, an outspoken
Bush critic and admitted liar...

1573
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:37,490
brought you memos, you assumed
their authenticity and didn't source them?

1574
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:41,525
That when not one but two
of the four document examiners...

1575
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:43,643
expressed doubts the memos were real...

1576
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:45,962
you pushed that aside
and rushed this on air?

1577
01:43:46,119 --> 01:43:49,043
Or why you personally contacted
the John Kerry campaign...

1578
01:43:49,239 --> 01:43:52,210
on behalf of Bill Burkett,
a man who has dedicated himself...

1579
01:43:52,359 --> 01:43:54,362
to smearing the president?

1580
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:55,845
Tell me, Mary.

1581
01:43:56,039 --> 01:43:59,965
Where exactly does politics
not enter into this?

1582
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:03,324
Or are you just that bad at your job?

1583
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:06,810
Do you know what it would take
to fake these memos?

1584
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:09,247
- Mary...
- No, this is important.

1585
01:44:09,399 --> 01:44:12,961
It would require the forger
to have an in-depth knowledge...

1586
01:44:13,119 --> 01:44:17,329
of the 1971 Air Force manual,
including rules...

1587
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:19,966
and regulations and abbreviations.

1588
01:44:20,119 --> 01:44:22,770
He'd have to know
Bush's official record front to back...

1589
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:25,365
to make sure none of the memos
conflicted with it.

1590
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:28,682
He'd have to know all the players
in the Texas Air National Guard...

1591
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:32,400
at the time... Not just their names,
but their attitudes, their opinions...

1592
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:34,608
including how
they related to one another.

1593
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:37,809
He'd have to know Colonel Killian
kept personal memos like this...

1594
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,809
for himself in the first place.

1595
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,605
He'd have to know
how Killian felt at the time...

1596
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:46,970
particularly about his superiors
and then First Lieutenant Bush.

1597
01:44:47,119 --> 01:44:50,761
He would have to know
or learn all of this...

1598
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:54,970
in order to fool us
as you assume he did.

1599
01:44:55,119 --> 01:44:56,564
Now...

1600
01:44:57,199 --> 01:44:59,680
do you really think that a man...

1601
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:02,844
who takes this kind of time
and precision...

1602
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:06,368
then goes and types these up
on Microsoft Word?

1603
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:19,168
Our story was about whether Bush
fulfilled his service.

1604
01:45:19,319 --> 01:45:22,243
Nobody wants to talk about that.
They wanna talk about fonts...

1605
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:24,402
and forgeries and conspiracy theories.

1606
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:28,484
Because that's what people do
these days if they don't like a story.

1607
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:30,368
They point and scream.

1608
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:33,126
They question your politics,
your objectivity. Hell...

1609
01:45:33,279 --> 01:45:34,520
your basic humanity.

1610
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:38,320
And they hope to God
the truth gets lost in the scrum.

1611
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,243
And when it is finally over...

1612
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:43,483
and they have kicked
and shouted so loud...

1613
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:46,962
we can't even remember
what the point was....

1614
01:45:48,199 --> 01:45:50,770
But you didn't prove it.

1615
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:57,208
You didn't prove Ben Barnes
got the president into the Guard.

1616
01:45:57,479 --> 01:46:00,086
You didn't prove the memos are real.

1617
01:46:00,279 --> 01:46:03,568
The burden of proof is on you.

1618
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:07,082
By that standard, The Times would
never have run the Pentagon Papers.

1619
01:46:07,239 --> 01:46:09,322
The Post wouldn't have listened
to Deep Throat...

1620
01:46:09,479 --> 01:46:13,724
- Ben Barnes is hardly Deep Throat.
- He's confessed to abusing his power...

1621
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:16,564
to keep some of the richest,
privileged sons of Texas...

1622
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:19,046
from getting their asses
blown off in Vietnam.

1623
01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:20,804
Ms. Mapes.

1624
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:24,086
Don't you think it's possible,
just possible...

1625
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,768
that some of those fine, young...

1626
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:29,360
"privileged men, as you call them...

1627
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:35,288
got into the National Guard
on their own merit?

1628
01:46:45,319 --> 01:46:48,608
No, sir. No, I do not.

1629
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:09,489
You had to do it, didn't you?

1630
01:47:10,479 --> 01:47:13,722
In the immortal words of Popeye,
"I am what I am."

1631
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:17,887
Well, I would have gone with
"To thine own self be true"...

1632
01:47:18,039 --> 01:47:19,929
but Popeye works.

1633
01:47:20,119 --> 01:47:23,328
They'll have their findings in a few weeks.
I'll call you when I hear.

1634
01:47:23,479 --> 01:47:26,722
All right. Thanks.

1635
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:31,444
Hey, Mary.

1636
01:47:33,039 --> 01:47:34,849
I believe you.

1637
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:51,408
But I think he needs a helmet.
Have you got a helmet?

1638
01:47:52,119 --> 01:47:56,408
- A helmet?
- He needs a helmet.

1639
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:59,291
- Oh, he hasn't got a head.
- Dang it.

1640
01:47:59,439 --> 01:48:01,726
Can you find a head?

1641
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:05,289
No.

1642
01:48:07,079 --> 01:48:11,688
- Unless you want to chop his head...
- Chop his head off? Maybe.

1643
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,050
Hello?

1644
01:48:20,199 --> 01:48:23,681
Mary, the report is out
and it's very bad.

1645
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:26,568
I'm putting Jonathan Anschultz
on the line.

1646
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:28,768
- Jonathan, can you hear me?
- Yeah.

1647
01:48:29,039 --> 01:48:32,328
Mary, as I said, the report's bad.
You're being terminated.

1648
01:48:34,039 --> 01:48:37,761
It's not something I would've chosen
to do under the circumstances, but....

1649
01:50:36,279 --> 01:50:37,645
Hippie scum.

1650
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:40,681
Jarhead fuck.

1651
01:50:44,399 --> 01:50:45,925
If you ever need a reference...

1652
01:50:46,279 --> 01:50:47,610
What, you can...

1653
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:50,411
tell them how we destroyed
modern journalism together?

1654
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:59,688
I'll see you around.

1655
01:51:04,479 --> 01:51:09,690
We've shared a lot in the 24 years
we've been meeting here each evening.

1656
01:51:10,199 --> 01:51:15,286
And before I say good night,
this night, I need to say thank you.

1657
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:19,690
Thank you to the thousands of
wonderful professionals at CBS News...

1658
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,604
past and present...

1659
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:25,360
with whom it's been
my honor to work over these years.

1660
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:29,609
And a deeply felt thanks to all of you...

1661
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:33,525
who have let us into your homes
night after night.

1662
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:38,481
It has been a privilege,
and one never taken lightly.

1663
01:51:39,159 --> 01:51:44,689
To a nation still nursing a broken heart
for what happened here in 2001

1664
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:47,610
and especially those
who found themselves closest...

1665
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:49,801
to the events of September the 11th.

1666
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:56,046
To our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen
and Marines in dangerous places.

1667
01:51:56,880 --> 01:52:00,009
And to those who have endured
the tsunami.

1668
01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:03,003
And to all who have suffered
natural disasters...

1669
01:52:03,159 --> 01:52:06,163
and who must find the will to rebuild.

1670
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:11,009
To the oppressed and to those
whose lot it is to struggle...

1671
01:52:11,199 --> 01:52:14,921
in financial hardship
or in failing health.

1672
01:52:16,359 --> 01:52:17,885
To my fellow journalists...

1673
01:52:18,319 --> 01:52:22,769
in places where reporting the truth
means risking all.

1674
01:52:23,399 --> 01:52:26,289
And to each of you...

1675
01:52:27,239 --> 01:52:28,765
courage.

1676
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:33,362
For the CBS Evening News,
Dan Rather reporting.

1677
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:36,449
Good night.

1678
01:54:14,039 --> 01:54:16,087
My God.

1679
01:54:19,279 --> 01:54:21,168
You wanna go for a walk?

1680
01:54:21,319 --> 01:54:22,810
Yeah.

1681
01:54:23,305 --> 01:54:29,670
