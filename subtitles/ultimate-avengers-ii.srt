Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,592
My gratitude to you all.

3
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:05,027
Many years have passed since your prince
has tread upon his native soil.

4
00:01:05,062 --> 00:01:10,300
So let us now welcome home
T'Challa, the son of Wakanda.

5
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,724
- They hate me.
- Give it time.

6
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:21,837
Intruders! Intruders!

7
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:33,315
Father, you are in no condition
to deal with this.

8
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:36,299
I implore you to listen
to the prince, Your Highness.

9
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,732
You have yet to heal
from the previous attacks!

10
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:40,537
- The royal guard should...
- No, Nakinda.

11
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:45,504
- We cannot afford to lose any more.
- Father, please, don't go. Not now.

12
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,826
I've missed you, son.
We will have our time together.

13
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:51,124
I promise.

14
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,840
At least allow me to go with you.

15
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,587
As you will one day come to accept...

16
00:01:55,722 --> 00:01:59,669
this responsability belongs
only to the king.

17
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:46,937
Your prowess in battle
never fails to entertain.

18
00:02:46,972 --> 00:02:49,863
But after so many performances...

19
00:02:49,898 --> 00:02:53,845
I am here to insure your retirement.

20
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:10,041
Father!

21
00:03:10,496 --> 00:03:14,230
So, the prodigal prince has returned.

22
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:18,742
Now the royal bloodline
can finally end here.

23
00:03:18,743 --> 00:03:22,100
All over the jungle floor.

24
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:25,508
You will not touch my son!

25
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,835
Father!

26
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,245
Father.

27
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,552
No!

28
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:15,211
Father.

29
00:06:23,852 --> 00:06:25,297
Your Highness.

30
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,247
Come with me.

31
00:06:34,302 --> 00:06:36,504
The Eye of Kings.

32
00:06:39,074 --> 00:06:42,905
The right of access has now been
handed down to you.

33
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,725
- You were supposed to call for backup.
- I didn't need it.

34
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,028
This is the last time
you do this to me.

35
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:45,354
And look! You're wounded again.

36
00:08:45,385 --> 00:08:49,603
Steve, I know what you're doing.
Believe me, I have been there.

37
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:53,711
You cannot fill your life with this.
It will kill you.

38
00:08:53,957 --> 00:08:55,372
Then let it.

39
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,056
So what are we now?
A one man army?

40
00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:13,841
You left me no choice.

41
00:09:13,842 --> 00:09:18,242
I'm just doing my job, General. That's
why you thawed me out for, isn't it?

42
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:21,929
You wanna be back on ice? Is that it?
Because that's where you're headed.

43
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,632
- Feet first, with a toe tag.
- If you'll excuse me, Sir,

44
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:27,119
I'm signed on with Bravo team
for a warehouse raid.

45
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,533
Not any more.

46
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:31,081
What's happened to you, son?

47
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:34,060
- Why are you such a mess?
- I'm fine, Sir, really.

48
00:09:34,061 --> 00:09:37,054
No, you're not.
You need R and R like anyone else.

49
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:38,973
- I'm a super soldier!
- You're a man!

50
00:09:38,974 --> 00:09:42,080
Now be straight with me.
Why are you dodging the downtime?

51
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,753
I'd just rather keep busy,
that's all.

52
00:09:43,754 --> 00:09:46,007
You got something against
having a personal life?

53
00:09:46,014 --> 00:09:48,602
It hurts less when
you're fighting, doesn't it?

54
00:09:48,603 --> 00:09:52,499
- You don't know anything about me.
- I know that you are afraid of peace.

55
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,320
Because the moment you have it,
a normal life seems within your grasp,

56
00:09:56,364 --> 00:09:58,721
and you don't want
to lose that again.

57
00:09:58,878 --> 00:10:01,832
Steve, listen. You got a right
to be a little screwed up

58
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:05,003
after a sixty-year deep freeze.
But that's the past.

59
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,160
You killed the Chitaurii,
you made the world safe again.

60
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:10,424
It's time to start letting go.

61
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:11,960
Yes, General.

62
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,831
He will not listen, you know.
He never does.

63
00:10:17,832 --> 00:10:21,125
He'd better,
or I'll lock him up with Banner.

64
00:10:26,546 --> 00:10:31,303
Dr. Banner, please
stay focused on the video.

65
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:35,304
That's good. Very good.

66
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,081
At which point
did you lose control over Hulk?

67
00:10:39,185 --> 00:10:42,741
Was it here...
Dr. Banner?

68
00:10:42,997 --> 00:10:44,503
I think so!

69
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:47,955
- Elaborate, please.
- We've been over this!

70
00:10:48,203 --> 00:10:52,428
You do want the court to have a clear
picture of what went on, don't you?

71
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:55,075
Don't you, Dr. Banner?

72
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:57,176
Now let's start again.

73
00:10:57,273 --> 00:11:00,454
You made a conscious decision
to become the Hulk.

74
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:01,691
Why?

75
00:11:01,692 --> 00:11:04,031
We were under attack by aliens.

76
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:08,197
- Elaborate, please.
- It was the only way to stop them!

77
00:11:08,998 --> 00:11:10,641
The only way?

78
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:13,169
Are we being honest, Dr. Banner?

79
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:15,429
Weren't others involved?

80
00:11:15,464 --> 00:11:17,554
The Avengers, perhaps.

81
00:11:17,774 --> 00:11:21,222
Yet when they came to assist,
you turned on them.

82
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,488
Why is that?

83
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:25,119
Please answer the question.

84
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,166
Here's a question for you, Oiler.
Did you ask for this job?

85
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:33,049
I mean, I'm the guy who booted
you off the SSP team last year.

86
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,346
- So this is payback, right?
- Dr. Banner!

87
00:11:35,347 --> 00:11:38,600
Attacking others is what you do!
Not me.

88
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:40,503
I want to see Betty Ross.

89
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,440
She has been made aware
of your request.

90
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:45,360
Get her down here now!

91
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,892
Hit him with the sedative.

92
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:03,580
We'll start again once
you've had a chance to... relax.

93
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,113
Keep the video on a continuous loop.

94
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:08,632
Yes, Doctor.

95
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,745
Who are you?

96
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,391
He's called the Black Panther.

97
00:13:42,846 --> 00:13:46,658
All right, everyone, I got this.
Return to your posts.

98
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,955
You heard him, move it!

99
00:13:52,842 --> 00:13:54,990
A little far from home, aren't you?

100
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,732
Where's T'Chaka?

101
00:14:00,293 --> 00:14:03,809
He is... I, am king
of Wakanda now.

102
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,641
And I demand to speak alone
with Captain America.

103
00:14:06,642 --> 00:14:09,974
Now look, your father and I never
got off on the right foot. Why don't

104
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:13,020
- you and I do things differently?
- It is a private matter.

105
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:17,120
- I keep no secrets from General Fury.
- My father was killed, four days ago.

106
00:14:17,165 --> 00:14:18,371
By this man.

107
00:14:18,568 --> 00:14:19,671
Kleiser!

108
00:14:20,935 --> 00:14:23,413
I thought he died in 1945.

109
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:29,187
- I must know how to stop him.
- You can't.

110
00:14:29,188 --> 00:14:30,034
Why?

111
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,957
Because I killed him twice,
and he always comes back.

112
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,943
You need to open your borders.

113
00:14:34,944 --> 00:14:37,980
The Avengers are your only chance
of defeating the Chitaurii.

114
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:40,165
No. Outsiders are forbidden.

115
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,592
You're the king now,
change that law.

116
00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:45,442
I've betrayed my people enough
just by coming here.

117
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,872
There's nothing you can tell me?

118
00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:00,458
Assemble the Avengers.

119
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,600
You're looking good, hun'!

120
00:15:27,687 --> 00:15:30,030
Just a minor spike
in your insulin levels.

121
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:38,865
Up the plasma I.G.F.
concentration to 850 u.

122
00:15:42,384 --> 00:15:44,411
Muscular composition is fluctuating.

123
00:15:45,393 --> 00:15:47,401
We're getting a dip
in lean body mass!

124
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:52,882
Lumbar spine density
is at 84 and rising!

125
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:59,973
Pulsatile et diurnal outputs
are off the charts!

126
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:02,799
Hank, you're crashing,
we have to terminate!

127
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,776
No, no! Just get me to 61 ft.

128
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,328
Stabilize him.

129
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:12,530
Anabolic levels are too erratic,
he's gonna stroke out!

130
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,419
Bring him down, slowly.

131
00:16:16,682 --> 00:16:17,603
Yeah.

132
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,108
You just blew two months of work!

133
00:16:27,109 --> 00:16:28,922
We were beyond the safety margin.

134
00:16:28,923 --> 00:16:30,612
Hank, this is not worth your life!

135
00:16:30,613 --> 00:16:34,054
- My life, my risks!
- No, it's your ego!

136
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,400
60 ft, it's the maximum strain
your body can endure.

137
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:41,180
Let's just put a pin in it, and refocus
on the other phase of the project.

138
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:43,835
Other phase?
What, you mean shrinking?

139
00:16:44,374 --> 00:16:46,479
You can put a pin in that too, Janet.

140
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:49,720
If we don't start
reconditionning your body,

141
00:16:49,721 --> 00:16:51,729
it will never handle
the reduction in size!

142
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,660
Forget it!

143
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:55,621
I'm not going back to being
a two-inch superhero.

144
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:07,014
Janet, you have a call
from General Fury's office.

145
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:25,647
Tell her we refuse to supply
any transitional hardware

146
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:27,877
unless their programming is compatible.

147
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:30,767
Oh and, Jarvis, send her flowers too.

148
00:17:30,768 --> 00:17:33,871
With an apology for...
Well, she'll know.

149
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,340
Certainly, Sir.
And on another matter,

150
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,900
<i>shall I reschedule your meeting
with the company's vice présidents?</i>

151
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,774
No need, I brought them with me.

152
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,256
Sir, I've got General Fury for you.

153
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:55,661
I have to call him back.

154
00:18:07,979 --> 00:18:09,151
Come on!

155
00:18:21,078 --> 00:18:21,937
Sir?

156
00:18:21,962 --> 00:18:24,566
- What, Jarvis?
- The team is gathering.

157
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:26,139
Tell Fury to sit tight.

158
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,703
I'll be there when I can.

159
00:18:29,177 --> 00:18:32,076
OK, rest time is over.
Let's go.

160
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:26,192
Professor Ross!

161
00:19:26,655 --> 00:19:29,491
What could have made it so brittle?

162
00:19:39,858 --> 00:19:44,968
- Hey, Betty!
- Hey, you!

163
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:49,027
So, how are things going?

164
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,205
We're working things out.

165
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:55,118
What about you? How's Bruce?

166
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,852
I... haven't been to see him yet.

167
00:19:59,794 --> 00:20:01,106
Daddy's home!

168
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:04,209
What? No hug for me?

169
00:20:05,157 --> 00:20:07,704
- How about you, big guy?
- Shut up, Stark.

170
00:20:08,393 --> 00:20:10,851
Ah! It's good to be back.

171
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:22,319
- Bruce?
- Betty!

172
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:25,863
I'm so glad you're here.
Do you know what's been going on?

173
00:20:25,864 --> 00:20:27,963
Fury has brought me up on charges.

174
00:20:27,964 --> 00:20:31,032
I know. I've been called as a witness.

175
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:35,584
I realize the Hulk made a disaster of
things, but he did get rid of the aliens.

176
00:20:35,585 --> 00:20:37,820
- No, he didn't.
- What?

177
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,143
- What are you saying?
- They're still out there.

178
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:43,053
I just thought you should know.

179
00:20:43,548 --> 00:20:46,738
- Wait! What's Fury doing about it?
- Nothing that concerns you.

180
00:20:46,739 --> 00:20:49,660
Please, Betty,
I need something to think about.

181
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,606
Something besides guilt.

182
00:20:54,223 --> 00:20:56,750
Wer'e analyzing the alien wreckage
from the battle.

183
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:58,026
What have you found?

184
00:20:58,129 --> 00:21:02,431
Not much, but sections of the vibranium
hull have become brittle.

185
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,900
- We don't know why.
- Can I see a piece of it?

186
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:06,645
- If we work together...
- Are you insane?

187
00:21:06,646 --> 00:21:09,423
No one wants your help,
and no one trusts you any more.

188
00:21:09,424 --> 00:21:11,276
Betty, don't go, Betty!

189
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:24,822
Steve, I know about Kleiser.
So, if you'd like to talk...

190
00:21:24,823 --> 00:21:28,316
There's nothing to talk about.
When I find him, I'm going to kill him.

191
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:29,713
Once and for all.

192
00:21:29,714 --> 00:21:31,056
OK, listen up.

193
00:21:34,498 --> 00:21:39,122
Herr Kleiser, commander of nazi Germany
covert Totenkopf division.

194
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,642
Only Kleiser's allegiance
wasn't to the third Reich.

195
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:47,248
In reality, he was
a chitauri shapeshifter.

196
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:49,172
The only one we know of.

197
00:21:49,298 --> 00:21:51,556
Kind of their super soldier.

198
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:01,490
He was assumed killed on May 2nd, 1945,

199
00:22:01,491 --> 00:22:04,991
when his nuclear warhead was
sabotaged above the North Atlantic.

200
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,589
So like our Captain,
Kleiser has survived.

201
00:22:17,723 --> 00:22:21,604
We know this because he just
assassinated the king of Wakanda.

202
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,523
That tells me there's some kind
of alien agenda still in play.

203
00:22:25,524 --> 00:22:27,360
What do we know about Wakanda?

204
00:22:27,465 --> 00:22:28,727
Very little.

205
00:22:28,741 --> 00:22:32,106
They're an isolationist nation
we're unable to take a look at.

206
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,899
Satellite surveillance is blocked.
And undercover efforts have failed.

207
00:22:36,053 --> 00:22:39,004
Bottom line:
they don't want us in there.

208
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,606
Sounds like a reason
to pay them a visit.

209
00:22:42,005 --> 00:22:43,800
General, I want to go in alone.

210
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,992
- No one knows Kleiser and...
- Sorry, Cap',

211
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,538
- this one is a team effort.
- He'll kill everyone!

212
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:50,365
Just let him go, Fury!

213
00:22:50,395 --> 00:22:54,028
If old Stars and Stripes is nursing
a grudge against that alien Nazi,

214
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:55,413
why drag us into it?

215
00:22:55,414 --> 00:22:58,030
Like I said, it's a team effort.

216
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,657
We go in under the radar, gather
information, and get out fast.

217
00:23:01,692 --> 00:23:05,114
I don't need an international
incident in the middle of all this.

218
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:07,377
All the more reason
to send me in alone.

219
00:23:07,378 --> 00:23:10,239
This one needs a clear head
in the lead, Captain.

220
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,092
You're carrying too much baggage.

221
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:14,524
Widow, you'll be in command.

222
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,881
Demoted!

223
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:19,776
I guess that makes him
Private America, huh?

224
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,328
This is for certain.

225
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:24,592
The Chitaurii wouldn't assassinate
a king just for kicks.

226
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,591
They're up to something over there.

227
00:23:26,786 --> 00:23:28,680
And I want to know what it is.

228
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:14,333
- Father?
- T'Challa.

229
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:15,757
What are you doing here?

230
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:18,129
I heard you arguing with the elders.

231
00:24:19,145 --> 00:24:21,787
We do not always see eye to eye.

232
00:24:21,788 --> 00:24:24,269
They don't want you to send me
away to school, do they?

233
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,720
No, they do not.

234
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:26,970
Then why do it?

235
00:24:26,971 --> 00:24:30,104
Because I believe
the future king of Wakanda

236
00:24:30,105 --> 00:24:32,763
should know something
of the outside world.

237
00:24:32,774 --> 00:24:34,129
I do not understand.

238
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,312
Changes are on the horizon, son.

239
00:24:36,313 --> 00:24:38,950
Our nation must know
how to change with it.

240
00:24:38,971 --> 00:24:42,304
- But if the elders believe...
- A good king knows what is right.

241
00:24:42,305 --> 00:24:44,644
Even when others tell him it is wrong.

242
00:24:44,645 --> 00:24:46,945
I do not ever want to be king, Father.

243
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:50,714
Some day, T'Challa,
you will be a great leader.

244
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,241
Fan out, 20 meters spread.
And report what you find.

245
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:22,212
Wasp, check above the canopy.

246
00:25:22,525 --> 00:25:23,447
Got it!

247
00:25:27,707 --> 00:25:31,995
Hey, Cap', you know, ever since
I first learned about you in school,

248
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,693
- there's something I've wanted to know.
- Is this really the best time, Tony?

249
00:25:35,694 --> 00:25:38,514
- Well, there may not be another time.
- What is it?

250
00:25:38,515 --> 00:25:41,652
When you decided to jump out
of this rocket, back in 1945,

251
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:43,436
did you think
you'd come out of it alive?

252
00:25:44,037 --> 00:25:45,103
Non.

253
00:25:45,442 --> 00:25:49,618
- Really? You're a better man than me.
- That's not true.

254
00:25:49,653 --> 00:25:52,666
Hey, I'm fine with it. You got
the guts, I go for the glory.

255
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,723
I'm not interested
in posthumous awards.

256
00:25:54,728 --> 00:25:56,865
You'll never really know
until the time comes.

257
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:08,234
Taylor, report. Taylor!

258
00:26:18,073 --> 00:26:19,276
I'm sorry, Cap'!

259
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,032
- Stop!
- Panther!

260
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,635
- You should not be here.
- It's all right.

261
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,260
You must leave immediately!

262
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:09,276
We came for answers, and we're not
going anywhere until we get them.

263
00:27:14,158 --> 00:27:16,042
I will not warn you again.

264
00:27:16,081 --> 00:27:18,019
Please, you wanted my help,

265
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,295
- I'm here to give it to you.
- I sought your advice.

266
00:27:20,296 --> 00:27:21,575
Not your involvement.

267
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:24,444
This man, Kleiser,
he killed your father,

268
00:27:24,445 --> 00:27:27,042
but he also killed
many people very close to me.

269
00:27:27,051 --> 00:27:29,572
You and I, we're after the same thing.

270
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:35,025
All right, come with me. But only you.
The others must return to their ship.

271
00:27:43,726 --> 00:27:44,611
Come.

272
00:27:46,571 --> 00:27:49,026
- You must not be seen.
- Why?

273
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,995
Wouldn't your people understand
if you told them we were here to help?

274
00:27:52,996 --> 00:27:55,613
No. Because we never needed any help.

275
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,474
Is that a chitauri ship?

276
00:28:18,622 --> 00:28:22,356
Yes, shot down in 1942.
Come this way.

277
00:28:22,383 --> 00:28:23,567
Wait...

278
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:27,456
Your people shot it down?

279
00:28:27,703 --> 00:28:31,181
There's more to Wakanda
than what appears on the surface.

280
00:29:16,182 --> 00:29:17,722
What is this place?

281
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:22,758
The Hall of Kings. All of
our past leaders are interred here.

282
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:25,153
This one holds my grandfather.

283
00:29:25,356 --> 00:29:30,712
Azari the Wise. It was during his reign
that the Chitaurii first arrived.

284
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:34,310
My grandfather met with their leader
in hope of advancing peace.

285
00:29:34,376 --> 00:29:38,113
That leader... was Kleiser.
But Kleiser didn't want peace.

286
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:41,326
He wanted war,
and the very life blood of our land.

287
00:29:41,332 --> 00:29:42,453
Life blood?

288
00:29:43,077 --> 00:29:48,209
Our most sacred possession.
We call it the Heart of Wakanda.

289
00:29:49,381 --> 00:29:51,916
Kleiser sought to take it by force.

290
00:29:56,057 --> 00:29:57,515
The Wakandans rose up,

291
00:29:57,516 --> 00:30:01,463
and eventually defeated them.
But our nation was deeply scarred.

292
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,709
We became an untrusting people,and
all trespassers became our enemy.

293
00:30:05,725 --> 00:30:09,422
So, what could Kleiser be planning now?
Do you have any idea?

294
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,663
No. But I believe my father did. He had
been preparing me for this very time.

295
00:30:14,976 --> 00:30:17,418
I intend to avenge his death, Captain.

296
00:30:17,777 --> 00:30:20,059
I understand.
More than you know.

297
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,005
- Sire! Intruders have been...
- Nakinda!

298
00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:24,756
What have you done?

299
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,033
They have found your friends.

300
00:30:34,174 --> 00:30:36,593
Come out, come out!
Wherever you are!

301
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:49,302
Don't make me hurt you!

302
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,488
Knock it...
Knock it off!

303
00:31:02,623 --> 00:31:04,076
Get away from him!

304
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:23,640
Spears? I'm afraid you'll have
to do better than that!

305
00:31:24,996 --> 00:31:26,108
Or not.

306
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,276
Well, that's embarrassing.

307
00:31:40,895 --> 00:31:42,587
End this fighting now!

308
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:52,457
I said stop! It is I who allowed
these outsiders to be here.

309
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,442
Hank's been poisoned!

310
00:31:56,443 --> 00:31:58,375
I will provide him with an antidote,

311
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,422
but only if you leave here now.

312
00:32:02,483 --> 00:32:06,036
And if you return, they will kill you.

313
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,957
I recommend regrouping with
additional forces, General.

314
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:20,150
Then we can return...

315
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:23,088
I'm not picking a fight with
Wakanda, not until I have to.

316
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:23,983
But, General...

317
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:27,509
- Return to base for Cap's debriefing.
- Yes, Sir.

318
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:31,465
General, Prof. Ross is still waiting
for you in the hangar.

319
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:34,638
Tell her I'm on my way.
Any progress on locating Thor?

320
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:35,654
Sorry, Sir.

321
00:32:35,655 --> 00:32:38,803
He's been a no show at every
environmental protest on the planet.

322
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,905
Keep checking every hippy rally
you can think of.

323
00:32:49,878 --> 00:32:52,728
Father, I seek your guidance.

324
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,031
The death vision I have been given...

325
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:14,142
Reveal to me...
what does it portend?

326
00:33:14,155 --> 00:33:16,307
What befalls the Avengers?

327
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:24,184
I must warn them!

328
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:27,412
Midgaard has turned
its back on the gods.

329
00:33:27,413 --> 00:33:30,283
You are not to become involved, my son.

330
00:33:30,313 --> 00:33:32,090
But I am involved.

331
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:35,976
You have meddled in the affairs
of man far too often.

332
00:33:35,977 --> 00:33:37,937
Now leave them to their fate.

333
00:33:37,939 --> 00:33:40,681
Father, I must do what is right.

334
00:33:40,716 --> 00:33:43,169
I forbid you from aiding them.

335
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:46,741
Return to Asgaard, at once.

336
00:33:46,747 --> 00:33:49,475
I cannot. Forgive me.

337
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:28,244
Prof. Ross.
What do you have?

338
00:34:28,384 --> 00:34:31,869
This. The inner core of each ship
possessed a block

339
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,383
of vibranium denser
than any I've seen yet.

340
00:34:34,384 --> 00:34:36,114
Some kind of power source?

341
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,371
I think so.

342
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:40,858
We know vibranium absorbs energy.
So, it makes sense.

343
00:34:41,351 --> 00:34:44,112
Now, watch what happens
when I try to tap into it.

344
00:35:00,347 --> 00:35:02,726
There's probably enough energy
stored in that cube

345
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:06,371
to power New-York for six months.
I can't even get a reading.

346
00:35:06,478 --> 00:35:08,756
What about
the brittle sections of the hull?

347
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,715
- Any connection?
- I doubt it.

348
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,683
But they do seem to be concentrated
in one general area.

349
00:35:24,675 --> 00:35:30,483
Now, when you developed the super soldier
formula only for yourself,

350
00:35:30,518 --> 00:35:33,111
did you feel remorse
over the deception?

351
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,615
I need to see Professor Ross.

352
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:38,215
Please answer the question, Dr. Banner.

353
00:35:38,216 --> 00:35:40,683
No, look! That's the answer!
Right there!

354
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,029
Dr. Banner, try to stay focused...

355
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:45,987
Shut up, you pandering quack,
and get me Betty Ross!

356
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,905
No! I have to tell her!
I have the answer! I...

357
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,845
Dr. Oiler, isn't that an unsafe dosage?

358
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,719
What's unsafe is letting that man
get too angry again.

359
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:17,759
There's a Chitauri down there.

360
00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:24,929
There's nothing we can do.
We've been ordered back to base.

361
00:36:32,171 --> 00:36:34,015
Steve, don't do this!

362
00:36:44,574 --> 00:36:46,974
- Follow that shuttle!
- Let him go!

363
00:36:47,478 --> 00:36:50,964
I mean it! If the guy wants to go rogue,
who are we to stop him?

364
00:36:50,965 --> 00:36:53,589
Are you serious?
You'd leave him down there to die?

365
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:56,697
Hey, if you ask me,
he'd be doing this team a favor.

366
00:36:57,537 --> 00:36:59,354
I can't believe you just said that.

367
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,811
OK, this ship's suddenly
gotten very small.

368
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:05,842
You know what, Hank?
I'm done with this!

369
00:37:05,843 --> 00:37:10,577
I'm done massaging your ego,
I'm done defending you to everyone!

370
00:37:10,578 --> 00:37:12,494
And I'm done supporting you!

371
00:37:12,505 --> 00:37:15,988
Supporting me?
You have been holding me back!

372
00:37:19,067 --> 00:37:20,541
Don't tempt me.

373
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:24,300
Honoring the past,

374
00:37:24,301 --> 00:37:27,841
pledging your life to defend
the secrets of our land,

375
00:37:27,842 --> 00:37:30,851
protecting Wakanda
from the outside world.

376
00:37:30,852 --> 00:37:33,531
These are the sacred decrees
you have betrayed!

377
00:37:33,532 --> 00:37:35,166
The decrees are obsolete.

378
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:38,093
Blindly adhering to them will only
lead to our downfall.

379
00:37:38,094 --> 00:37:41,429
Nakinda, as advisor to the royal family,

380
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:44,491
do you wish to dispute these charges?

381
00:37:44,851 --> 00:37:47,047
No. I cannot.

382
00:37:47,444 --> 00:37:50,143
These western philosophies...

383
00:37:50,195 --> 00:37:52,614
were learnt beyond our borders.

384
00:37:52,615 --> 00:37:56,544
We warned your father
such ideals would corrupt you.

385
00:37:56,545 --> 00:38:00,663
- My father was a wise man.
- Who made an unwise decision.

386
00:38:00,668 --> 00:38:05,504
As such, we are forced to relieve you
of your royal authority.

387
00:38:05,506 --> 00:38:09,809
The elders hereby assume
the mantel of leadership.

388
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:35,665
- Panther!
- Why have you returned?

389
00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:38,244
For that thing.
I want answers from it.

390
00:38:38,281 --> 00:38:40,733
I have tried.
It offers nothing.

391
00:38:41,535 --> 00:38:44,975
However, perhaps S.H.I.E.L.D
has more successful methods.

392
00:38:44,976 --> 00:38:47,015
We might, let us try.

393
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:51,540
Agreed, but only if I go with you.

394
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:59,820
General, the transport ship
is returning to wakandan airspace.

395
00:38:59,821 --> 00:39:01,282
Patch me through to it.

396
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:10,169
I arrive with news of the Chitaurii.

397
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,769
You're a little late,
we already know about them.

398
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:17,668
The real danger is not upon the ground,
but in the northern sky.

399
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:20,049
Reposition the orbital scope.

400
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:41,104
Have you lost your mind?

401
00:39:41,752 --> 00:39:44,120
We have to find out
what this thing knows.

402
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,808
But by bringing it onboard,
you put all of us at risk!

403
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,682
She's right, you know.

404
00:40:14,825 --> 00:40:16,571
Fire at this position!

405
00:40:45,571 --> 00:40:46,804
No!

406
00:41:02,023 --> 00:41:04,689
Alert the infirmary to expect wounded.

407
00:41:04,771 --> 00:41:05,989
I'll take her.

408
00:41:10,955 --> 00:41:15,385
- Stark, do you need a medic?
- Only if he moonlights as a mechanic.

409
00:41:15,769 --> 00:41:17,679
Just send Jarvis for me.

410
00:41:21,215 --> 00:41:25,254
General, the warship remains
in orbit above Africa.

411
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,710
And now, some kind of energy field
is spreading out from it.

412
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,809
How long before
it encompasses the planet?

413
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:34,466
Within minutes, Sir.

414
00:41:48,354 --> 00:41:50,129
<i>Somewhere in the african continent,</i>

415
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:52,992
<i>a translucent membrane
now spreading across the sky,</i>

416
00:41:52,993 --> 00:41:55,035
<i>dimming the light over the entire land.</i>

417
00:41:55,036 --> 00:41:57,920
<i>...apparently flowing from
the enormous alien craft</i>

418
00:41:57,923 --> 00:42:02,004
<i>that remains in a geosynchronous
orbit, eye above Africa.</i>

419
00:42:27,563 --> 00:42:30,949
You're quite correct, Sir.
A most alarming development.

420
00:42:30,984 --> 00:42:33,453
So much for Iron Man, version 6.7.

421
00:42:33,454 --> 00:42:36,030
Shall I prepare
a memorial service, Sir?

422
00:42:36,071 --> 00:42:38,427
Nice to see you
so broken up about it.

423
00:42:38,428 --> 00:42:40,300
It was my favorite model.

424
00:42:40,335 --> 00:42:43,321
They were all your favourites
at one time, Sir.

425
00:42:43,322 --> 00:42:46,314
True. Now let's pick up
my next favorite.

426
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:56,068
I've always fancied the design and
colour scheme of the tailwind model.

427
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:58,433
Nah, I believe
heavy equipment is in order.

428
00:42:59,848 --> 00:43:03,082
The War Machine,
sturdy, impervious...

429
00:43:03,086 --> 00:43:06,302
And handles like ten tons of tractor.

430
00:43:06,421 --> 00:43:08,982
Yeah, but it's got some sweet guns.

431
00:43:10,819 --> 00:43:12,133
Indeed, Sir.

432
00:43:20,029 --> 00:43:20,916
Bruce!

433
00:43:23,996 --> 00:43:26,684
I was told you had something
urgent to tell me.

434
00:43:35,481 --> 00:43:38,789
- There! You see?
- What?

435
00:43:38,811 --> 00:43:41,405
When the Hulk strikes
the vibranium hull,

436
00:43:41,406 --> 00:43:43,367
it flashes, just before breaking.

437
00:43:44,302 --> 00:43:46,651
Are those the same areas
that became brittle?

438
00:43:50,516 --> 00:43:51,786
They are!

439
00:43:52,031 --> 00:43:53,282
What's its meaning?

440
00:43:53,283 --> 00:43:54,306
It's gamma!

441
00:43:54,307 --> 00:43:57,612
The Hulk radiates it. I think that's
what weakens the vibranium.

442
00:43:59,487 --> 00:44:02,141
- That could be it!
- You need to run tests.

443
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,046
How?

444
00:44:03,047 --> 00:44:05,380
There's a small gamma
generator in my lab.

445
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:06,962
Betty, just get me out of here.

446
00:44:06,963 --> 00:44:10,038
I can't. Fury is the only one
with the release thumb.

447
00:44:10,068 --> 00:44:13,821
- And he doesn't...
- I know. He doesn't trust me.

448
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,798
I'm going to make things right, Jan.

449
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:42,101
I promise.

450
00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:46,479
I... I can't be the man
you wanted me to be.

451
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,050
What are you doing here?

452
00:44:50,051 --> 00:44:51,121
I am sorry, Hank.

453
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:54,170
Save it! You know, Jan thought
you were some kind of great hero.

454
00:44:54,171 --> 00:44:57,282
Well thanks, hero! Because of you,
she's in a coma.

455
00:44:57,454 --> 00:44:58,914
Look, I just wanted to...

456
00:44:58,915 --> 00:45:01,684
Get out of here,
before I throw you out!

457
00:45:06,526 --> 00:45:09,961
Move! Get inside!
Seek shelter! Quick!

458
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,224
Stay here until we get
our final orders.

459
00:46:20,225 --> 00:46:21,756
Do you understand?

460
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:27,638
Do you see now? We will never need
the help of outsiders.

461
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:29,765
I do not share your confidence.

462
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:05,806
<i>There is chaos in the streets,
as immense mechanical creatures...</i>

463
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:08,359
<i>The sky is darkening
over the city as we speak,</i>

464
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,748
<i>releasing an army of unstoppable
machines to the ground.</i>

465
00:47:10,749 --> 00:47:13,835
- General, Wakanda is contacting us.
- Put them through.

466
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:18,714
General Fury, I am personally
requesting S.H.I.E.L.D.'s assistance.

467
00:47:18,715 --> 00:47:21,477
You and everyone else!
The whole world is under attack.

468
00:47:21,478 --> 00:47:24,677
Yes, but what the aliens are after
is here, in Wakanda.

469
00:47:25,444 --> 00:47:28,730
No more secrets, T'Challa.
What does Kleiser want?

470
00:47:28,731 --> 00:47:31,103
It is what you call vibranium.

471
00:47:31,104 --> 00:47:33,204
- How much of it?
- A mountain.

472
00:47:33,339 --> 00:47:36,383
An ancient meteorite buried
beneath our land.

473
00:47:36,588 --> 00:47:39,630
And extending to depths
we cannot even imagine.

474
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,358
It has given us protection.

475
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:47,828
For in its unrefined state, we can
forge it into any weapon we choose.

476
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,264
Without assistance, Wakanda will fall.

477
00:48:17,265 --> 00:48:19,122
And so will the rest of the world.

478
00:48:19,742 --> 00:48:23,456
You have betrayed your country
for the last time.

479
00:48:23,457 --> 00:48:27,531
If we do not get help, there will be
nothing left of our country.

480
00:48:53,817 --> 00:48:56,742
They're using our technology
to power their weapons!

481
00:48:56,743 --> 00:48:58,039
Destroy the ship!

482
00:49:29,714 --> 00:49:32,104
- I thought you were all dead.
- Not yet.

483
00:49:38,407 --> 00:49:39,498
Kill them!

484
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:58,346
I have commanded you to end
your involvement, Thor!

485
00:49:58,381 --> 00:50:00,962
Humanity may have abandoned us, father,

486
00:50:00,963 --> 00:50:03,316
but I will not abandon them!

487
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:28,065
Now, you die, for the last time.

488
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,725
My words exactly!

489
00:51:52,873 --> 00:51:54,261
Oh no!

490
00:52:12,056 --> 00:52:13,409
It works!

491
00:52:58,712 --> 00:52:59,740
Come on!

492
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,549
No!

493
00:53:26,907 --> 00:53:28,964
Don't kill me, please,
don't kill me!

494
00:53:30,748 --> 00:53:32,587
What? You want that opened?

495
00:53:33,226 --> 00:53:34,373
I can't!

496
00:53:35,767 --> 00:53:38,928
Wait! Wait!
I can kill him for you.

497
00:53:40,014 --> 00:53:41,692
What? No...

498
00:53:43,935 --> 00:53:45,521
No!

499
00:54:27,916 --> 00:54:28,956
Bruce!

500
00:54:35,456 --> 00:54:36,460
Bruce!

501
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:41,328
That gamma generator...
It worked.

502
00:54:41,496 --> 00:54:44,791
- You were right!
- You have to get it to Fury.

503
00:54:44,792 --> 00:54:46,894
No! We have to get you
out of here!

504
00:54:46,895 --> 00:54:49,453
- It's too late for me.
- Don't say that!

505
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:53,193
Just turn into the Hulk.
Smash your way out!

506
00:54:53,194 --> 00:54:54,640
I can't.

507
00:54:54,722 --> 00:54:56,737
I won't leave you like this!

508
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:59,466
Betty, I am sorry...

509
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:02,678
I am sorry for hurting you.

510
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,314
I love you!

511
00:55:04,781 --> 00:55:06,731
I love you...

512
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,271
Bruce!

513
00:55:13,691 --> 00:55:15,423
We have to go, Betty.

514
00:55:15,536 --> 00:55:17,901
We have to get to the hangar
and get out of here.

515
00:56:04,389 --> 00:56:07,561
This is Widow.
How far out are you?

516
00:56:07,861 --> 00:56:09,097
We'll be ready.

517
00:56:09,121 --> 00:56:10,181
Iron Man!

518
00:56:16,515 --> 00:56:18,398
Sorry for the delay, Natalia.

519
00:56:18,556 --> 00:56:20,066
Got it. On my way.

520
00:56:35,891 --> 00:56:38,565
Be patient! You are next.

521
00:57:06,429 --> 00:57:08,222
We need that distraction now.

522
00:57:09,785 --> 00:57:11,890
Warriors, attack!

523
00:57:15,271 --> 00:57:16,341
Fire!

524
00:57:19,591 --> 00:57:20,623
Fire!

525
00:57:28,715 --> 00:57:30,792
Again! Fire!

526
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:34,897
Fire!

527
00:57:55,884 --> 00:57:57,376
Nice work, Betty.

528
00:57:58,448 --> 00:58:02,058
It's not the most stylish accessory,
but strap it on.

529
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:06,248
Janet!

530
00:58:11,799 --> 00:58:13,061
Are you all right?

531
00:58:13,194 --> 00:58:14,801
I'm OK, Hank.

532
00:58:16,063 --> 00:58:18,741
Once you get into the ship,
find the center core.

533
00:58:18,742 --> 00:58:20,832
The vibranium power source
should be there.

534
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:22,748
Can you get through its defenses?

535
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:26,180
Hey, piece of cake!
Except for that big canon.

536
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:28,731
Not a fan of the big canon.

537
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,263
- Leave that one to me.
- It's all you, buddy!

538
00:58:32,265 --> 00:58:35,673
Hold on! You gonna need someone
watching your back inside that ship.

539
00:58:35,674 --> 00:58:37,359
Hank, what are you doing?

540
00:58:37,621 --> 00:58:40,498
Sorry, big guy,
I've got no room for a passenger.

541
00:58:40,533 --> 00:58:41,842
I know how to make room.

542
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:44,229
No! Your body can't handle it.

543
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,454
Shrinking now will tear you up inside.

544
00:58:46,455 --> 00:58:49,470
Honey, I'll be fine.
I need to do this.

545
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,209
OK then.

546
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:05,155
Hank, please.

547
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,946
I told you I'd be fine.

548
00:59:06,947 --> 00:59:08,666
So stop babying me, huh?

549
00:59:14,642 --> 00:59:17,236
Nothing like flying first class!

550
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:31,022
So, er... If Thor misses, can we
survive a hit form that canon?

551
00:59:31,099 --> 00:59:33,175
Let's just say you won't feel a thing.

552
00:59:33,732 --> 00:59:35,591
OK, we're going in!

553
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,992
- Close your ears, Hank!
- What?

554
01:00:11,596 --> 01:00:13,272
So what are we hoping to find?

555
01:00:13,273 --> 01:00:14,524
The power core.

556
01:01:08,113 --> 01:01:10,195
- Can you make it?
- Yeah.

557
01:01:12,483 --> 01:01:16,959
Foolish boy. Do you think the power
of the Panther will serve you

558
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,899
any better than it did you father?

559
01:01:18,951 --> 01:01:22,367
- You can't kill me.
- He's right.

560
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,796
I don't have to kill him to stop him.

561
01:01:25,797 --> 01:01:27,726
I just need you to get him over there.

562
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:31,559
OK.

563
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,109
<i>Military efforts are failing
while alien forces</i>

564
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:36,820
<i>continue driving the population
to the center de New-York...</i>

565
01:01:36,821 --> 01:01:38,658
They're coming from
the south and the east.

566
01:02:22,082 --> 01:02:23,978
We have to flood the chamber!

567
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:33,609
It's not enough!
Break off the nozzles!

568
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:55,900
We're close.

569
01:02:57,378 --> 01:03:00,279
With these energy readings,
the core must be enormous.

570
01:03:00,334 --> 01:03:02,042
You mean like that thing?

571
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:03,247
Exactly.

572
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:13,748
What are you doing?

573
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:17,556
I'll be all right! Go!
I'll hold them off!

574
01:03:48,428 --> 01:03:49,885
No! No!

575
01:04:29,696 --> 01:04:32,321
Hank! Wake up!

576
01:04:35,813 --> 01:04:36,921
Hank!

577
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,615
I got you, buddy.

578
01:05:11,229 --> 01:05:13,162
Hank! Hank!

579
01:05:14,168 --> 01:05:15,188
No!

580
01:05:18,944 --> 01:05:22,848
See? I told...
I told you I could be...

581
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:25,167
the man you always...
wanted me to be.

582
01:05:25,168 --> 01:05:27,729
You are, Hank. You are.

583
01:05:37,923 --> 01:05:39,779
It's going to hit the city!

584
01:05:44,977 --> 01:05:47,863
- I think I can deflect it.
- But can you survive that?

585
01:05:47,864 --> 01:05:50,349
If not, I'll take
that posthumous award.

586
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:02,091
<i>Warning: Fuel cell at 2% and falling.</i>

587
01:06:03,355 --> 01:06:05,406
Divert power from life support.

588
01:06:09,926 --> 01:06:14,599
<i>Total system failure in:
3... 2... 1...</i>

589
01:06:31,425 --> 01:06:34,330
No! No... not another one.

590
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:10,810
You really are a god.

591
01:07:12,385 --> 01:07:13,919
Your Highness.

592
01:07:19,941 --> 01:07:21,964
What shall we do with Kleiser?

593
01:07:22,174 --> 01:07:23,369
Bury him.

594
01:07:24,951 --> 01:07:26,221
It's over.

595
01:08:04,073 --> 01:08:05,650
Betty...

596
01:08:22,921 --> 01:08:25,370
At least he's still out there, Betty.

597
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:34,518
Hey!

598
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:19,045
Steve. Things have been strained
between us lately, and I...

599
01:09:20,361 --> 01:09:25,510
That's in the past. I think we should
start focusing on our future.

600
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:37,753
Come on, Goldy Locks!
I'll buy you a pint of mead.

601
01:09:41,504 --> 01:09:43,613
It's not every day we save the world.

602
01:09:48,047 --> 01:09:52,088
Actually, General, I have saved
Midgaard on several occasions.

603
01:09:52,089 --> 01:09:55,467
Did you not hear of my victory
over the fire demon Sirta?

604
01:09:55,468 --> 01:09:58,127
They speak of it still
in the halls of Valhalla.

605
01:09:59,305 --> 01:10:05,514
